22/1/24, 10:18 AM - +27 74 513 3207: Good morning.
It's nice that we received this offer letter from you, thank you very much the admission team. 
Ropafadzo highlighted to me that she still has some concerns on the program!
22/1/24, 10:18 AM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @27745133207, May I know what Ropafadzo has highlighted to you ?
22/1/24, 10:25 AM - +27 74 513 3207: She told me that she said it before that the program offered (BA in Geography) is not the program that she applied for. She said she applied for Mining Engineering.
22/1/24, 10:26 AM - +263 71 287 7089: Hello everyone,
22/1/24, 10:28 AM - +263 71 287 7089: The program BA in geography I am not really interested in it and I am not sure about what is it all about.
22/1/24, 10:51 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about your thoughts here, However I believe we already had a discussion about the same right ?
22/1/24, 10:53 AM - +27 74 513 3207: Yes I think so
22/1/24, 10:54 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct dear, I remember that you were comfortable with BA in Geography that time, right ?
22/1/24, 10:59 AM - +27 74 513 3207: No
22/1/24, 11:02 AM - +27 74 513 3207: Ropafadzo highlighted about this long before and there is no clear answer up to now
22/1/24, 11:06 AM - +27 74 513 3207: If I remember very well it was said that when searching for universities, that's when this issue was supposed to be rectified
22/1/24, 11:09 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Please go through this message
22/1/24, 11:35 AM - +27 74 513 3207: I think we have got a challenge here. On this message you clearly highlighted that you don't have Mining Engineering program available. The problem now is Ropafadzo is insisting that she needs Mining Engineering and not BA in Geography. So I don't know now how this can be resolved.

Me as a parent I can not force her into something that she is not comfortable with.
22/1/24, 11:40 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I appreciate that you have shared this with us, I understand and respect Ropafadzo interest. Let me share that the course we have offered for her is based on her interest and career goals. I would like to connect with her to understand her point of view. May I know if she is available ?
22/1/24, 11:47 AM - +27 74 513 3207: At the moment she is not available. Let me check on her and will let you know.
22/1/24, 11:52 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @27745133207
23/1/24, 11:02 AM - +263 71 287 7089: Hello ,good morning officers.!
23/1/24, 11:05 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Ropafadzo, How are you doing today ?
23/1/24, 11:09 AM - +263 71 287 7089: I am doing good thank you
23/1/24, 11:11 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that dear, In regards to our last conversation I believe there was some confusion regarding your course right ?
23/1/24, 11:16 AM - +263 71 287 7089: Yes
23/1/24, 11:26 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, Would you help me understand what is the confusion here ?
23/1/24, 11:29 AM - +263 71 287 7089: The program (BA in geography) am not really interested in it and I don't know about it very well.
According to my searches it is an old program and I don't think would suite my career desire.
23/1/24, 11:32 AM - +263 71 287 7089: This issue was discussed before and it was said it's possible to change it but here ,the admission team said it can't be changed so am confused .
So if the program I want is not readily available I think we can find some solution otherwise.
23/1/24, 11:38 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, May I kindly know which course you want to pursue at the moment considering that Mining Engineering is not available ?
23/1/24, 11:40 AM - +263 71 287 7089: I wanted mining engineering abroad so if it's not available I prefer studying other courses here in Zimbabwe.
25/1/24, 11:39 AM - +27 74 513 3207: Good morning
25/1/24, 9:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings @27745133207
25/1/24, 9:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you today, we will reconnect tomorrow at 4:00 pm to move ahead with our discussion
25/1/24, 9:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Have a good night ahead!
26/1/24, 7:05 PM - +27 74 513 3207: Good evening.
What's the way forward here?
26/1/24, 8:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening @27745133207, I hope you are doing well!
26/1/24, 8:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In regards to your concern that Ropafadzo only want to pursue Mining Engineering for Higher Education, I would like to have a discussion with academic board so that I can assist you further. Kindly allow me sometime for the same, I will connect with you soon.
26/1/24, 8:27 PM - +27 74 513 3207: Noted
6/2/24, 12:46 PM - +27 74 513 3207: How are you all. I hope this message will find you well.

Ever since we discovered that Ropafadzo's desired program thus Mining Engineering was not available from that end, we have been running around looking for other options here, and we recently finally got one.

Thank you very much the entire Edoofa team for your great support and cooperation.

14/2/24, 9:37 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings Everyone! 

With regard to my above messages, I am sure you must be excited. I would like to know if you have completed the form, Could you please let me know ?
24/2/24, 12:33 PM - +27 74 513 3207: How are you all. I hope this message will find you well.

Ropafadzo has since found another option in Zim, since that end there was no Mining Engineering program available. So I don't know how is the Refund process of the enrollment fee paid of $350?
26/2/24, 10:43 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Ropafadzo, How are you doing ?
26/2/24, 10:43 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you due to the long weekend. I would like to connect with you today, Are you available ?
26/2/24, 10:48 AM - +27 74 513 3207: Fine and you.
Yes available
26/2/24, 10:53 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are available for the discussion, I would like to know which course is Ropafadzo pursuing ?
26/2/24, 10:56 AM - +27 74 513 3207: She is now pursuing Civil engineering
26/2/24, 11:16 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, May I know why she is pursuing Civil Engineering ?
26/2/24, 11:29 AM - +27 74 513 3207: The thing here is, she wanted Mining Engineering program from abroad (Edoofa), and you guys said you don't have that program available. So that's why she decided to pursue Civil engineering locally in Zimbabwe.
26/2/24, 11:37 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Have she explored the Mining Engineering locally ? <This message was edited>
26/2/24, 11:46 AM - +27 74 513 3207: Yes
26/2/24, 11:52 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, May I know why she is not pursuing the same in that case ?
26/2/24, 12:04 PM - +27 74 513 3207: She said she does not want it locally, she wanted it abroad
26/2/24, 1:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I see @27745133207, I am sure she have a dream to study abroad and if she want to pursue Civil Engineering locally why she is not ready to pursue same course abroad. By considering the opportunity to pursue civil engineering studies abroad, she would gain valuable experience that sets her apart from other professionals in the industry. She also have the chance to develop a global mindset that will serve her well throughout her career. <This message was edited>
26/2/24, 1:09 PM - +27 74 513 3207: Understood, but the thing is she has already settled for one of the local institutes
26/2/24, 1:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: May I know what is the tuition fees there ?
26/2/24, 1:15 PM - +27 74 513 3207: $1000 per semester
26/2/24, 1:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing, May I know what is the cost of accommodation ?
26/2/24, 1:24 PM - +27 74 513 3207: No accommodation cost, only transport cost $80 per month.
26/2/24, 1:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Let me help you explain since you mentioned that in Zimbabwe per semester fees are $1000, now as you must be aware each academic year consist of 2 semesters so that will make your per annum cost of $2000 only for the tuition fee.
26/2/24, 1:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, if Ropafadzo is planning to travel daily which is assuming to be cost around $80 per month and this will also cost you yearly $960. Plus some miscellaneous costs of the examination fee which can cost up to $150 per annum.
26/2/24, 1:28 PM - +27 74 513 3207: Yes
26/2/24, 1:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now if we sum up the cost here, $2000 + $960+ $150 = $3110, and this will be the balance if you choose any local university and not the expensive ones and keeping in mind Zimbabwe's economy that degree will not be enough for Ropafadzo to make her employable.

However, here at Edoofa, we make sure that from the tuition fee to accommodation and food everything is covered within the $2000-$3000, and with the affordable education Ropafadzo will also get an international degree recognition alongside the EWYL program that specifically focuses on skill development and making students employable ready. I hope you are able to understand now?
26/2/24, 1:36 PM - +27 74 513 3207: You think so. Here for the sack of way forward let's plan for the refund of the enrollment fee paid
26/2/24, 1:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @27745133207 I believe you have not compared the fees structure here, Are you assuming that by doing the studies there she will be able to secure the employment ?
26/2/24, 1:39 PM - +27 74 513 3207: Yes I believe
26/2/24, 1:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That’s great, but I have been reading something different about the current situation in Zimbabwe. 


https://www.newsday.co.zw/thestandard/local-news/article/200005224/no-new-jobs-for-zims-unemployed

https://www.fairplanet.org/story/scores-languish-in-poverty-as-jobs-haemorrhage-continues-in-zimbabwe/
26/2/24, 1:43 PM - +27 74 513 3207: Remember news is always news
26/2/24, 1:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's true, However one of our senior Academician Mr. Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

Even after paying this amount for Higher Education, student does not get the employment. I believe you are not up to date with Zimbabwe’s current economic situation. And it’s natural as sometimes we do not get to see the clearer picture until someone assists us with the same.
26/2/24, 2:07 PM - +27 74 513 3207: I think someone from outside and someone within the way they see things are different
26/2/24, 2:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @27745133207 He is not there for few weeks, he was there for 90 days. I believe you get a lot of understanding in this much time
26/2/24, 2:27 PM - +27 74 513 3207: Okay
28/2/24, 1:05 PM - +27 74 513 3207: Good afternoon.
@919650537098 still waiting to hear from you about the Refund process?
5/3/24, 12:47 PM - +27 74 513 3207: Good afternoon.
Still waiting to hear from you
5/3/24, 2:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ropafadzo, I hope you are doing well! 

Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you for the past few days as the team has arrived back for Harare, I am sure you must be aware of the recent event we had there. However, I am available today and have thoroughly reviewed the last message you shared.
5/3/24, 2:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me assist you with your concern regarding the refund, I am sure you must be aware that The enrollment fee you've paid is refundable only if, as an organization, we fail to assist you in securing a scholarship opportunity for your higher education in India. However, this is not the case for you, as you have received a scholarship offer letter from PDM University, making you ineligible for a refund according to our policy.
5/3/24, 2:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: While I'm more than willing to explain this policy in detail, I'm also concerned about your sudden contemplation of giving up on your educational plans. I had a conversation with your counselor the other day, and they mentioned that Ropafadzo was truly inclined towards Mining Engineering and wanted to pursue the same course. After the counseling session and our guidance, we recommended a course that would help her pursue her interests. However, in our recent conversation, you mentioned that she's now planning to pursue Civil Engineering, which is quite surprising as her aspiration is quite different from what she's planning to do now.
5/3/24, 2:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I believe the concern you have is something different. I'm more than willing to offer my support and help you understand the right way for your daughter. I believe if we have an open conversation, we can together find a solution that aligns with Ropafadzo's aspirations and goals.
5/3/24, 2:29 PM - +27 74 513 3207: Okay.
But in this case the organisation failed to provide Mining Engineering program
5/3/24, 2:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @27745133207 I believe there is a misunderstanding on your part as we have never promised you to provide the offer letter for Mining Enginerring. I would like to know if you have gone through the admission acceptance letter which is issued by Edoofa which also mentions the refund policy?
5/3/24, 2:39 PM - +27 74 513 3207: You said if the organisation fails to provide or to meet my requirements one would be eligible for the refund, so in this case I think we are eligible because you failed to provide the required program.
5/3/24, 2:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I would like to address that the course you have enrolled in, BA (Geography), which is also specified in your Edoofa Admission Acceptance letter. I have attached the letter for your reference, allowing you to review the details.

Upon reviewing your request, it appears that the course you are inquiring about is not listed in your offer letter. Consequently, as per our policy, you are not eligible for a refund in this case.
5/3/24, 2:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/3/24, 2:56 PM - +27 74 513 3207: I think this was a second option after you said you don't have Mining Engineering program available.
But the truth of the matter is, my daughter wanted Mining Engineering program from the word go, and I think when you discovered that you don't have that program available, you then tried to encourage her or push her into BA in Geography.
5/3/24, 3:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No please, You have initially enrolled for BA Geography kindly go through the letter please
5/3/24, 3:11 PM - +27 74 513 3207: I don't know where is this BA in Geography coming from. We have been saying this now and again that it's Mining Engineering and you clearly stated that you don't have it available.
5/3/24, 3:15 PM - +27 74 513 3207: It's fine, if you are insisting that it's our fault then just enjoy nicely that $350. But I strongly feel that it's your fault. But here you are just trying to twist and turn us.
5/3/24, 3:19 PM - +27 74 513 3207: I'm totally disappointed. I didn't think a big organisation like you can do this to us. Our hard earned money going just like that?
5/3/24, 3:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @27745133207 We are not trying to twist and turn the situation here, I am only share the facts which I have with me. As per our records it is clearly mentions that you have been enrolled for the same course. Moreover the $350 you have paid is for the services we have provide which includes assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc
5/3/24, 3:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Moreover, One of the senior Counseling Admission is going through our conversation and he wanted to connect with you to assist your concern and doubt. Are you available for a call ?
5/3/24, 3:28 PM - +27 74 513 3207: Which visa documentation assistance?
5/3/24, 3:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Are you available for a call?
5/3/24, 3:34 PM - +27 74 513 3207: Not available
5/3/24, 3:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: May I know the reason why ?
