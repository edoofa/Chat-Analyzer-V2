2/1/24, 9:19 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Thank you
2/1/24, 9:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Most Welcome dear
3/1/24, 2:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Wadzanai , I hope you are doing well. 

In reference to our discussion yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
3/1/24, 2:14 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Yes
3/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, Let's start our discussion.  The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
3/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
3/1/24, 2:20 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Thats something remarkable to know
3/1/24, 2:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
3/1/24, 2:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
3/1/24, 2:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
3/1/24, 2:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
3/1/24, 2:32 PM - +263 71 617 6748: I have gone through the benefits
3/1/24, 2:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
3/1/24, 2:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
3/1/24, 2:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.
3/1/24, 2:40 PM - +263 71 617 6748: I am following
3/1/24, 2:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
3/1/24, 2:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
3/1/24, 2:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
3/1/24, 2:47 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Yes
3/1/24, 2:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3.*Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
3/1/24, 2:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
3/1/24, 3:01 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Yes
3/1/24, 3:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
3/1/24, 3:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
3/1/24, 3:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 30, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before January 30, 2024. The remaining $450 should be paid by February 30, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
3/1/24, 3:06 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Not as of now
3/1/24, 3:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
3/1/24, 3:10 PM - +263 71 617 6748: No l am not familiar with the process
3/1/24, 3:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
3/1/24, 3:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
3/1/24, 3:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
3/1/24, 3:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
3/1/24, 3:16 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Yes of course
3/1/24, 3:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
3/1/24, 3:18 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Yes
3/1/24, 3:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
3/1/24, 3:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
3/1/24, 3:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
3/1/24, 3:24 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Clear
3/1/24, 3:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
3/1/24, 3:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
3/1/24, 3:32 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Yes l am
3/1/24, 3:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
3/1/24, 3:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
3/1/24, 3:37 PM - +263 71 617 6748: That's understood
3/1/24, 3:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
3/1/24, 3:41 PM - +263 71 617 6748: For now l have no queries but if l happen to have one l will do ask.
3/1/24, 3:42 PM - +263 71 617 6748: But l would like to know about the costs of my admission process and higher education
3/1/24, 3:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, The total cost of your education will be in the shared range which is $2700 - $3700 and the registration fees will be in the range of $500 - $1000. Please note that the registration fees is included in your first year tuition fees.
3/1/24, 3:46 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Okay thank you
3/1/24, 3:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
3/1/24, 3:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.
3/1/24, 3:52 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Well my parents were not present for this discussion ,lm sure they will have a follow up of these benefits and also hope for their approval
3/1/24, 3:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure dear, I would like to connect with them
3/1/24, 3:58 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Once they have a follow up of the discussion they will connect with you as they are not available at the moment ,thank you

3/1/24, 4:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you dear
4/1/24, 8:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Wadzanai, I hope you are doing well.
4/1/24, 8:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: May I know if you have connected with your parents regarding your remaining enrollment fees ?
4/1/24, 8:32 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Good evening Ma'am
4/1/24, 8:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings dear
4/1/24, 8:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Have you gone through my above message ? <This message was edited>
4/1/24, 8:40 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Yes l have and they claim that they may not afford these figures if lm willing   for admission this year.However they said if it is possible to change  my year of admission they might get enough time to arrange for these figures.So l was hoping to ask if this request l have to change my year of admission is possible
4/1/24, 8:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263716176748 I am confused with your message, you mentioned earlier that with the benefits shared by Mr. Shivjeet you will be able to complete procedure. What happened dear?
4/1/24, 8:50 PM - +263 71 617 6748: There might have been a mistake as l meant to say that l may not be able to complete the procedure  and that was the reason l was requesting for changing the year .
4/1/24, 8:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, Why you want to change your academic year ?
4/1/24, 8:56 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Well my parents realised that they will not afford the the registration fee
4/1/24, 8:57 PM - +263 71 617 6748: And also considering other shortcomings that may require payment
4/1/24, 8:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand @263716176748But you have not received your offer letter yet why are you making these decision as of now ?
4/1/24, 9:03 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Well that is because  they are barely able to complete the other part of the enrolment ,so completing the process is definitely going to be difficult,that is why changing the year is important because at least by then they will be fully prepared and also have a proper budget
4/1/24, 9:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know dear, In that case I would like to know when are you planning to complete the remaining enrollment fees?
4/1/24, 9:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As even if we requested the officials, you need to complete the procedure first
4/1/24, 9:10 PM - +263 71 617 6748: I am not sure ,but l will keep communicating
4/1/24, 9:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand dear, Kindly have a discussion with your parents about our today's conversation and then we will reconnect with you tomorrow to discuss further.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Lovely Professional University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
15/1/24, 8:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 1:00 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
15/1/24, 8:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

15/1/24, 9:18 PM - ~ Mobby💦🔥 added +263 78 377 1700
16/1/24, 4:21 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. In that case, let us plan to reconnect in the afternoon at 03:00 PM. We are eagerly looking forward to our discussion. 

We will go over the offer letter in detail and offer guidance on the next steps necessary to complete Galgotias University admission formalities.

For now, we will bring our conversation to a close. I wish you a blessed day ahead, and please convey our regards to your family as well.
16/1/24, 2:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Wadzanai,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
16/1/24, 2:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
16/1/24, 3:05 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Thank you
16/1/24, 3:06 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Yes l have gone through the letter
16/1/24, 3:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.

The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
16/1/24, 3:09 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Yes of course
16/1/24, 3:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any queries you have. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
16/1/24, 3:18 PM - +263 71 617 6748: 1.$1225 
2.4years
3.$200
4.$700
16/1/24, 3:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 4-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 8 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $1225 making your per annum tuition fee ($1225 *2) = $2450. Is that clear?
16/1/24, 3:24 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Clear
16/1/24, 3:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -
16/1/24, 3:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
16/1/24, 3:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
16/1/24, 3:29 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Okay
16/1/24, 3:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
16/1/24, 3:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?
16/1/24, 3:34 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Besides the tuition fee that means l will also have to pay for the accomodation fee right
16/1/24, 3:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263716176748 You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
16/1/24, 3:38 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Yes of course
16/1/24, 3:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $700 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on January 29th, 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
16/1/24, 3:43 PM - +263 71 617 6748: What if it happens that l don't meet the deadline as stated ma'am ?
16/1/24, 3:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263716176748 I would like to attend this query of yours at the end of our discussion so that we can first discuss the offer letter.
16/1/24, 3:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
16/1/24, 3:46 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Okay
16/1/24, 3:46 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Yes please
16/1/24, 3:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of January 29th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of February 29th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
16/1/24, 3:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before *January 29th, 2024*

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
16/1/24, 3:49 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Yes ,clear
16/1/24, 3:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
16/1/24, 3:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
16/1/24, 3:54 PM - +263 71 617 6748: I reside in Bulawayo
16/1/24, 3:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
16/1/24, 3:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
16/1/24, 3:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
16/1/24, 3:59 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Okay thank you ,l will consider that
16/1/24, 4:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
16/1/24, 4:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
16/1/24, 4:05 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Yes please
16/1/24, 4:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
16/1/24, 4:11 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Well received
16/1/24, 4:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
16/1/24, 4:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
16/1/24, 4:15 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Yes of course ,Al clear
16/1/24, 4:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
16/1/24, 4:18 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Not as of now
16/1/24, 4:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -
16/1/24, 4:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable. 

It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.
16/1/24, 4:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/
