I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 1:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 3:16 PM - +263 77 438 1218: Hello there. Compliments of the new season. Allow us to finalise some outstanding issues with our school administrators foe the release of the A Level results which are yet to be accessed. Hopefully before Friday next week, we should have resolved those issues.

Thanks for your usual support and consideration

Since the Zimsec results were released last month, we've been diligently working on your scholarship application to help you secure offer letters from various universities in India, giving you multiple options to choose from. Currently, you've received an offer letter from MVN University, and by the 15th of March, you can expect to receive the remaining offer letters as well.
5/3/24, 12:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you receive the offer letters, you'll have the privilege of comparing them and selecting the university that aligns best with your educational goals. Should you decide to change your university choice, you can do so with the transfer option, and any registration fees you've already paid will be adjusted accordingly.

Following the university selection, the next step will be to commence your visa application process, which will take place in April 2024l. Our Department of Student Welfare will be in touch with you to guide you through this process.
5/3/24, 12:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, it's essential to focus on your EWYL Program and ensure you stay connected with your mentor to upskill yourself.
