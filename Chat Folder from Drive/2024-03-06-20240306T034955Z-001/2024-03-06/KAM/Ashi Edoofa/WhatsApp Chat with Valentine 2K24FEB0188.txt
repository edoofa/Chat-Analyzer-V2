I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
16/2/24, 8:02 AM - +263 71 573 7527: Yes I am ready
16/2/24, 9:00 AM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/2/24, 9:01 AM - +263 71 573 7527: I am through
16/2/24, 9:16 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
16/2/24, 9:16 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
16/2/24, 9:16 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
16/2/24, 9:16 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear.
16/2/24, 9:16 AM - +263 71 573 7527: Yes they are clear
16/2/24, 9:22 AM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
16/2/24, 9:22 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
16/2/24, 9:22 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
16/2/24, 9:22 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
16/2/24, 9:23 AM - +263 71 573 7527: Yes I am following
16/2/24, 9:23 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -
16/2/24, 9:23 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
16/2/24, 9:23 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
16/2/24, 9:23 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
16/2/24, 9:24 AM - +263 71 573 7527: Yes the steps are clear
16/2/24, 9:29 AM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
16/2/24, 9:29 AM - +263 71 573 7527: Yes I am ready
16/2/24, 9:29 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
16/2/24, 9:29 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?

16/2/24, 10:16 AM - +263 71 573 7527: The second video was on Edoofa's vision for a student which is not only making education affordable and making the student employable but also increasing their capacity from a cup to a tank
16/2/24, 10:17 AM - +263 71 573 7527: The third video was on the effort made by Edoofa to ensure quality education over the past 10 years through identifying good schools and universities
16/2/24, 10:18 AM - +263 71 573 7527: The fourth video was largely on the statement of purpose and preparation for interacctive sessions with schools
16/2/24, 10:39 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good @263715737527 Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
16/2/24, 10:39 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
16/2/24, 10:39 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
16/2/24, 10:39 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
16/2/24, 10:40 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
16/2/24, 10:40 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
16/2/24, 10:40 AM - +263 71 573 7527: Yes I agree and was Clear able to understand the videos
16/2/24, 10:41 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
16/2/24, 10:41 AM - +263 71 573 7527: Yes we are

So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
16/2/24, 10:42 AM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

17/2/24, 11:25 AM - +263 71 573 7527: <Media omitted>
19/2/24, 9:46 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Valentine, I hope you are doing well!
19/2/24, 9:47 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Have you attended the event, How was your experience ?
19/2/24, 9:47 AM - +263 71 573 7527: Godd morning Ms Ashi I'm alright , how are you doing !

19/2/24, 9:47 AM - +263 71 573 7527: I attended yesterday I enjoyed the experience all in all
19/2/24, 9:48 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Perfect dear, Did you clicked any pictures ?
19/2/24, 9:49 AM - +263 71 573 7527: Unfortunately no I wasn't able to
19/2/24, 9:50 AM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries dear, Shall we continue with your admission journey ?
19/2/24, 9:50 AM - +263 71 573 7527: Yes we can !
19/2/24, 9:50 AM - Ashi Edoofa: With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
19/2/24, 9:51 AM - Ashi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 09th March, 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
19/2/24, 9:52 AM - +263 71 573 7527: Yes the preparations are all going well and my mother is aware of the deadline and says Shelley pay before the end of February
19/2/24, 9:55 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.
19/2/24, 9:55 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BA LLB* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
19/2/24, 9:58 AM - +263 71 573 7527: Yes that is correct
19/2/24, 9:59 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
19/2/24, 9:59 AM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
19/2/24, 9:59 AM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
19/2/24, 9:59 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
19/2/24, 10:00 AM - +263 71 573 7527: Yes I agree
19/2/24, 10:03 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
19/2/24, 10:03 AM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
19/2/24, 10:03 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
19/2/24, 10:06 AM - +263 71 573 7527: Yes we discussed this during our sessions
19/2/24, 10:06 AM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
19/2/24, 10:07 AM - +263 71 573 7527: Yes we are on the same page
19/2/24, 10:07 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*
19/2/24, 10:07 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $1650). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
19/2/24, 10:08 AM - +263 71 573 7527: Yes I understand
19/2/24, 10:09 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1650 as per the above example.
19/2/24, 10:09 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1650 - $1000 = $650 . This amount can be paid in two installments of $325 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $325 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
19/2/24, 10:11 AM - +263 71 573 7527: Ok I'm following
19/2/24, 10:18 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
19/2/24, 10:18 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
19/2/24, 10:18 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
19/2/24, 10:19 AM - +263 71 573 7527: Ok I understand
19/2/24, 10:21 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/2/24, 10:24 AM - +263 71 573 7527: I have a question but it's in regards to the situation whereby I fail to pay the application fee in time what happens afterwards
19/2/24, 10:25 AM - Ashi Edoofa: May I know why are you thinking that you won't be able to pay the fees in time dear ?
19/2/24, 10:26 AM - +263 71 573 7527: I'm just trying to be aware of all end results
19/2/24, 10:33 AM - Ashi Edoofa: @263715737527 In such scenario, I would like to share that the students are given enough time to raise their finances well, moreover they earn scholarship credits with EWYL Program as well.
19/2/24, 10:34 AM - +263 71 573 7527: Oh OK I understand
19/2/24, 10:34 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
19/2/24, 10:34 AM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
19/2/24, 10:34 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
19/2/24, 10:35 AM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/2/24, 10:35 AM - +263 71 573 7527: Wow this is amazing
19/2/24, 10:35 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed @263715737527 . The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
19/2/24, 10:36 AM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
19/2/24, 10:36 AM - +263 71 573 7527: Yes I am very excited
19/2/24, 10:42 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.
19/2/24, 10:42 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
19/2/24, 10:42 AM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
19/2/24, 10:48 AM - +263 71 573 7527: No I am not aware
19/2/24, 10:50 AM - Ashi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
19/2/24, 10:50 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
19/2/24, 10:50 AM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for February 28, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before February 28, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by March 28, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
19/2/24, 10:55 AM - +263 71 573 7527: I understand that's very exciting news !
19/2/24, 11:01 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/2/24, 11:01 AM - +263 71 573 7527: No I have no questions so far
19/2/24, 11:13 AM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
19/2/24, 11:13 AM - +263 71 573 7527: Yes I am very much excited
19/2/24, 11:16 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course.

We at Edoofa are filled with energy and excitement which has been fueled by the successful meet and greet sessions we hosted at the Martin Luther King Family of Schools, Harare last week. 

The entire Edoofa Team returned from Zimbabwe with a wealth of learnings, experiences, and opportunities for our students. Even before the team returned to India, we were already eagerly planning our next visit, spurred on by the incredible connections and opportunities we secured for the students of Zimbabwe.
28/2/24, 3:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, before I get into our experiences and the opportunities that were provided to you and your family, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success. 

I am also eager to hear about your experience at the meet and greet session. Whom were you able to connect with, and how do you envision your educational journey progressing from here?

28/2/24, 8:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: There were over 2700 attendees and out of these 2,700 attendees, our team had the privilege of engaging in 30-minute one-on-one sessions with 487 students, including Mr. Austin, Ms. Vilsha, Mr. Abhinav, Mr. Jyotishman, and Mr. Piiyush. If I am correct, you were one of the fortunate students and were able to interact with Ms. Vilsha to discuss the way forward for your education. How was your discussion?
28/2/24, 8:32 PM - +263 71 573 7527: Yes I managed to interact with her ! The discussion was nothing but amazing I left so well informed and reassured that my education was in good hands <This message was edited>

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *MVN University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
29/2/24, 7:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 12:00 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.

29/2/24, 7:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/2/24, 7:29 PM - +263 71 573 7527: Thank you so much Ms Ashi I really couldn't have done it without you
29/2/24, 7:30 PM - +263 71 573 7527: Yes I will be available
1/3/24, 12:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Valentine,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
1/3/24, 12:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly. 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
1/3/24, 12:02 PM - +263 71 573 7527: Afternoon Ms Ashi
1/3/24, 12:03 PM - +263 71 573 7527: Yes we managed to go through the offer letter
1/3/24, 12:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
1/3/24, 12:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
1/3/24, 12:09 PM - +263 71 573 7527: Yes we may begin the discussion
1/3/24, 12:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
1/3/24, 12:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is your annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
1/3/24, 12:15 PM - +263 71 573 7527: 1. Tuition fee - $350
2. Accommodation -$ 0
3. Annual fee -$ 1600
4. Sports - $125
5. Processing fee - $1000
1/3/24, 12:15 PM - +263 71 573 7527: If I'm not mistaken those are the amounts
1/3/24, 12:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 90% scholarship on tuition fees. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
1/3/24, 12:41 PM - +263 71 573 7527: Yes it's an amazing opportunity !
1/3/24, 12:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
1/3/24, 12:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1600 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1850.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1600. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
1/3/24, 12:52 PM - +263 71 573 7527: Yes I understand
1/3/24, 12:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
1/3/24, 12:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make their education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
1/3/24, 12:59 PM - +263 71 573 7527: I have finished going through the above message
1/3/24, 1:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1600, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
1/3/24, 1:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
1/3/24, 1:08 PM - +263 71 573 7527: Yes it's clear
1/3/24, 1:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a student. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
1/3/24, 1:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $1600. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1600 - $1000 = $600, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
1/3/24, 1:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
1/3/24, 1:15 PM - +263 71 573 7527: Yes it clarifies the EWYL credits and howbits adventageous
1/3/24, 1:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
1/3/24, 1:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1850 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $850 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
1/3/24, 1:21 PM - +263 71 573 7527: Yes I understand
1/3/24, 1:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as March 14th, 2024*.
1/3/24, 1:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion, I believe you recall that there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
1/3/24, 1:27 PM - +263 71 573 7527: Yes if I remember correctly the Edoofa team pays $100 from the original $ 1000 and the remaining $900 is paid in two installments of $450 and each harbouring two different deadlines the first being in two weeks and the other in a month
1/3/24, 1:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are absolutely right, Ms. Vilsha told me that you are eligible for the $100 grant from the Slice'Con Fund, I believe you were supposed to make tha payment for your registration fees by February end to earn this grant right ?
1/3/24, 1:37 PM - +263 71 573 7527: I wasn't aware that there was a deadline for eligibility of the grant
1/3/24, 1:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand dear, May I know when can you make the payment of $450 for your registration fees ?
1/3/24, 1:50 PM - +263 71 573 7527: Let me get back to you when we discuss the issue tonight
1/3/24, 1:50 PM - +263 71 573 7527: When is the second deadline ?
1/3/24, 2:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure dear, In the meantime let me share that to earn the grant you are supposed to pay the first installment by end of February and the second installment by end of March. As you were not aware of the date to pay the first installment, I will have a discussion with the officials to allow you sometime. I am sure you won't like to miss the grant right ?
1/3/24, 2:10 PM - +263 71 573 7527: Yes I would not want to kiss such a great opportunity
1/3/24, 2:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Don't worry, I am here to have a discussion with the officials and will present a strong case for you, although to make sure they approves your plan, I would like to know when you will be able to pay the first installment ?
1/3/24, 2:21 PM - +263 71 573 7527: I'm sure before the deadline which is the 14th if I'm not mistaken
1/3/24, 2:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: But dear, In that case you won't be able to earn the grant of $100
1/3/24, 2:35 PM - +263 71 573 7527: In order for me to get the grant when do I have to pay ?
1/3/24, 2:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As soon as possible dear, please connect with your parents and have a discussion
1/3/24, 2:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please don't worry, I am here for you.
1/3/24, 2:46 PM - +263 71 573 7527: Thank you so much for the support Ms Ashi
1/3/24, 2:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear, Let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
1/3/24, 2:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
1/3/24, 2:47 PM - +263 71 573 7527: Yes I live in Harare
1/3/24, 2:47 PM - +263 71 573 7527: I'll get back to you with a stable date as soon as possible
1/3/24, 2:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare.
1/3/24, 2:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 11% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. Here are the account details:

Account Name: Rajan Nayer
Name of Bank: FBC
Card Number: 5333 0380 2715 7004
Swift Code: FBCPZWHA
Sort Code: 8127
1/3/24, 2:49 PM - +263 71 573 7527: Ok thank you Ms Ashi may I please have his contact details so I can inform him of the transfer
1/3/24, 2:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure dear
1/3/24, 2:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
1/3/24, 2:53 PM - +263 71 573 7527: Thank you Ms Ashi
1/3/24, 2:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more.
