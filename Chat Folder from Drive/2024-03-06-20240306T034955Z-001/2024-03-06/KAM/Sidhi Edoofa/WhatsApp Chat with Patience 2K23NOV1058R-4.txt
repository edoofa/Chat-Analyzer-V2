18/12/23, 4:47 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Patience!

I hope you are doing well today. Thank you for your patience; Pardon me for not being able to connect with you earlier due to technical difficulties. How are you and your family doing today as we approach the best time of the year, filled with joy and holidays?
18/12/23, 5:36 PM - +263 77 738 3415: We are doing ok this side

How are you?
18/12/23, 5:38 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am good thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
18/12/23, 5:43 PM - +263 77 738 3415: Yes we may proceed please
18/12/23, 5:48 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details above . With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BBA  and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
18/12/23, 5:50 PM - +263 77 738 3415: Yes this is correct
18/12/23, 6:22 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. Please go through with these and after you are done with it, please let me know of the same. So that we can discuss it on the upcoming days.
18/12/23, 6:22 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Why the EDOOFA SECURE PLAN?*

Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.

*Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.

*Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.

*Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.

In summary, an Edoofa Secure Plan is a critical financial tool for parents with their children entering university soon. It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship.
18/12/23, 7:48 PM - +263 77 738 3415: I understand
19/12/23, 7:10 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well and blessed today. Please excuse me for the late reply. I was occupied with a university official today. May I know if you are available to proceed with our session?
19/12/23, 7:22 PM - +263 77 738 3415: We are doing well thank you
19/12/23, 7:22 PM - +263 77 738 3415: How are you?
19/12/23, 7:23 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking.
19/12/23, 7:24 PM - +263 77 738 3415: We may proceed but we are having network problems this side so some messages may arrive late
19/12/23, 7:30 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, may I know if you were able to go through the above points?
19/12/23, 9:27 PM - +263 77 738 3415: Yes l was able to go through the points
20/12/23, 6:13 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Patience!

I hope you are doing well today. I was not able to connect with you earlier as it was past my available hours at the moment. I would like to let you know that our available hours daily will be from 6:00 pm to 9:00 pm every day for this session. With that said may I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session?
20/12/23, 6:15 PM - +263 77 738 3415: We are good thank you

How are you?
20/12/23, 6:15 PM - +263 77 738 3415: Yes we may proceed
20/12/23, 7:16 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you were able to go through the above points?
20/12/23, 7:19 PM - +263 77 738 3415: Yes l was able to go through the above points
20/12/23, 7:19 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
20/12/23, 7:22 PM - +263 77 738 3415: Yes please
20/12/23, 7:22 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in December 2023, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
20/12/23, 7:23 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
20/12/23, 7:23 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
20/12/23, 7:29 PM - +263 77 738 3415: Yes l agree
20/12/23, 7:48 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
20/12/23, 7:48 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
20/12/23, 7:49 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
20/12/23, 7:53 PM - +263 77 738 3415: You are correct
20/12/23, 8:07 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
20/12/23, 8:07 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
20/12/23, 8:07 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
20/12/23, 8:07 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
20/12/23, 8:17 PM - +263 77 738 3415: Correct
20/12/23, 8:21 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
21/12/23, 6:35 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Patience!

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. May I know if you are currently available so that we can proceed with the session for your admission process?
6/1/24, 11:58 AM - Shivjeet Edoofa added Dev Edoofa

This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.
6/1/24, 12:33 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The decision to transition to a new phase in my life presents an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of students, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience remain enriched and fulfilling.

I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
9/1/24, 9:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
9/1/24, 9:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test. This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
9/1/24, 9:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
9/1/24, 9:38 PM - +263 77 738 3415: Hello 
How are you?
9/1/24, 9:41 PM - +263 77 738 3415: 2024 has been good .Thank you for asking.
12/1/24, 9:36 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am doing good as well and thank you so much for asking. I am glad to know that you had a great start to the year and I hope you are excited for the new day and most importantly the new year as well. @263777383415 , the new year brings about a transformative mindset in us which may not emphasize immediate changes but a change in the direction that you believe is needed.

If I talk about myself, I have made a resolution to bring more humility in myself and bring about a change in my perspective to be a better version of myself all while ensuring that I help all of our students to achieve their educational goals. With that said, I would like to know what aspirations or a change in your approach towards life you wish to achieve? <This message was edited>
13/1/24, 10:40 AM - +263 77 738 3415: My ambition for the future is to continue to grow, develop, and make meaningful progress in my life . I want to work hard and never stop striving for success, constantly pushing myself to achieve even more. Ultimately, I want to make a meaningful contribution and an impact in whatever I do.
13/1/24, 12:53 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that you want to become a better version of yourself by pure hard work which is missing a bit in this generation. This is something that is much appreciated to hear from such young minds who are already mature enough to be aware of the aspects they need to work on. I must commend this.
13/1/24, 12:53 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, moving towards the admission process, We, at Edoofa, are determined to provide affordable higher education to hardworking students and assist them in launching their careers to greater heights. We will be able to help you only if we can connect timely and have healthy discussions.
13/1/24, 12:53 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, this is something I want to inform you all that the agenda for the discussions, that we are going to have, is to help you all understand the process you will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since you are going to be occupied with school and your parents are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
13/1/24, 12:53 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January]. This way, we can align it with our availability as well and help you move forward and make progress in a streamlined manner. Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your input and find the right time for our sessions.
26/1/24, 8:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Patience,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa*. Recently I was having a discussion with the Academic Board. They highlighted  that you have not been able to proceed with your admission process in a timely manner, since your child is at school and you have been occupied with work. Hence, I pitched in that I will be able to help you out and take over your application profile so that together we can ensure a timely and smooth progress. Since my operational hours accommodate your timings more suitably, I will be assuming the duties of your admission officer. I am optimistic that together, we can pave the way for an auspicious beginning to your academic journey, resulting in the right career prospects and eventual success for both you and your family.
26/1/24, 8:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

27/1/24, 12:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Patience. I hope you are having a lovely day. How are you all doing today?
27/1/24, 12:51 PM - +263 77 738 3415: We are all doing well thank you

27/1/24, 5:56 PM - +263 77 688 9099: We are happy to know you Miss Singh. We hope we are going to travel together i this education journey until the end.
29/1/24, 9:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Patience. Thank you for your kind words. I was not able to respond to you on Saturday as my operational hours had concluded. However, I am glad that we can reconnect today to further proceed with our discussion.
29/1/24, 9:29 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I was going through Patience's application profile, and it is my understanding that you were in the 2nd step of the admission cycle i.e., Statement of Purpose which is yet to be completed. May I know if I am correct?
29/1/24, 8:08 PM - +263 77 688 9099: Good evening, I think we were on step 3 , selection and counselling
1/2/24, 1:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Patience.

I hope you are doing great today. Thank you for letting me know that. Before we move forward with our process, I would like to check in on you and your family. How have your days been going so far?
1/2/24, 7:52 PM - +263 77 688 9099: Good evening , we are doing well and bow are you?
1/2/24, 7:54 PM - +263 77 688 9099: Sorry for responding late. We are normally available in the evening from 7pm onwards
3/2/24, 10:06 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Patience.

I hope you are having a lovely morning. I understand please that you are usually available 7:00 PM onwards, May I know if you are available today for our discussion? <This message was edited>
3/2/24, 11:01 AM - +263 77 738 3415: Goodmorning
3/2/24, 11:01 AM - +263 77 738 3415: Yes l will be available today for the discussion
3/2/24, 11:06 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. I was going through your application profile, and it is my understanding that you were being introduced to the Financial Secure Plan. Allow me to proceed with the same -
3/2/24, 11:06 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Considering the constraints that the parents and students face, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Let me help you understand how this has been achieved.
3/2/24, 11:07 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay before your due date.
3/2/24, 11:07 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
3/2/24, 11:07 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
3/2/24, 11:09 AM - +263 77 738 3415: Yes please
3/2/24, 11:11 AM - +263 77 738 3415: This is correct. We have already paid the $200 from $350
3/2/24, 11:15 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
3/2/24, 11:17 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
3/2/24, 11:17 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
3/2/24, 11:17 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
3/2/24, 11:32 AM - +263 77 738 3415: This is very clear .Thank you so much
3/2/24, 11:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
3/2/24, 11:33 AM - +263 77 738 3415: Yes
3/2/24, 11:36 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
3/2/24, 11:36 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
3/2/24, 11:36 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
3/2/24, 11:37 AM - +263 77 738 3415: It sounds good
3/2/24, 11:48 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
3/2/24, 11:56 AM - +263 77 738 3415: 100 percent
3/2/24, 12:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
3/2/24, 1:05 PM - +263 77 738 3415: There are some family members who are not around at the moment. I will let you know by end of today when we are going to discuss about the whole thing.Thank you so much
3/2/24, 1:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you on Monday to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.

I hope this message finds you well and filled with the same excitement that's buzzing here at Edoofa! It's that time of the year again when we eagerly anticipate our annual Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare. This event holds a special place in our hearts as it brings us closer to our community, and we're counting down the days with great anticipation!
7/2/24, 11:01 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Just like clockwork, we're gearing up for the seminar next week, and I couldn't resist sharing our enthusiasm with you. Your presence would truly make the event all the more meaningful, guiding you on your journey to India. Hence, with immense joy, we wanted to extend the special invitation for the Meet and Greet Seminar to you and your wonderful family.
7/2/24, 11:01 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: And in the process of doing the same, I happened to notice that you haven't started your EWYL Program by now. In light of this, I had a discussion with Ms. Sanjana, the head of the EWYL Department, and I am happy to share that she has graciously agreed to make a special exception for you, expediting your application process.
7/2/24, 11:01 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As a result, I have gone ahead and created your very own dedicated EWYL Group - *Patience EWYL23E0941*, adding both you and your parents to the mix. If I have missed including any other family members, they can easily join using the following link: [https://chat.whatsapp.com/CQHlLH4M1DGGi3A5gSZ95C].

Within the group, the EWYL team will not only guide you on the hows and whens of the EWYL Program but also share all the exciting details about the upcoming Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare. We are genuinely thrilled to witness you embark on this transformative journey, and we are rooting for your success every step of the way!

Warmest regards,
Admissions Team.
7/2/24, 8:04 PM - +263 77 688 9099: Noted with thanks. I am joining the group. 🙏
8/2/24, 4:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Patience.

I hope you are all doing wonderful today. How has your day been going so far?
8/2/24, 6:21 PM - +263 77 688 9099: Hello Ms Singh, how are you? Here, its very hot
9/2/24, 11:55 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Patience.

I hope you are having a wonderful day. Our previous interactions have been limited due to our operational hours end at 5:00 PM. Considering your daytime work commitments, I understand the challenges in scheduling our sessions. However, I kindly inquire if it would be feasible for you to allocate an hour during the day (between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM) for our session? This would ensure timely progress in Patience's application process.
9/2/24, 3:11 PM - +263 77 688 9099: Good afternoon Ms Singh, how are you? Yaa, sure there has been also a lot of confusion regarding the whole process. I am available Saturday from 9.00am to 12.00 afternoon.
9/2/24, 4:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In such a case, let us reconnect tomorrow at 9:00 AM to discuss our way forward. I look forward to our session tomorrow. Have a blessed night!
12/2/24, 11:12 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Patience.

I hope you had a wonderful weekend. Kindly excuse me for not being about to reach out to you on Saturday, as our team is currently occupied with the preparation of our upcoming Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare this weekend. Our team will reach out to you shortly with more details about the event. Kindly suggest a time for today at your convenience when we can connect and have a discussion.
12/2/24, 11:45 AM - +263 77 688 9099: Morning, 8pm today will be ok
12/2/24, 12:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. In such a case, let us reconnect at 8:00 PM today to have a discussion about Patience's admission process. I wish you a good day ahead!
12/2/24, 12:46 PM - +263 77 688 9099: Thank you, namaste 🙏
13/2/24, 9:45 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Patience,

I hope you are doing great. Kindly excuse me for not being able to reach out to you yesterday. 8:00 PM is past my operational hours, however I wanted to take some time out for you specifically since we have not been able to connect during the day. However, something urgent came up at my home and I had to attend to it because of which I could not reach out to you.

May I know if you will be available any time in the morning, or are you only available during the evenings?
14/2/24, 7:51 AM - +263 77 688 9099: Hello Ms Siddi, how are you? I understand what you are going through.  But unfortunately we have not been making progress on our discussions. The thing is that my daughter goes to school from 7.00am to 6.00pm. So it is not possible to get intouch, moreover, her school does not allow students to bring cell phones. So she will be able to get hold of her cell once she is back from school, which is around 7.00pm evenings and weekends only.  For me the parent, I may be available on certain days depending on my work.
14/2/24, 9:10 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Greetings, Parents and Patience!

15/2/24, 7:30 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good morning
May I know what challenges are you facing?
15/2/24, 10:20 AM - +263 77 688 9099: Good morning, I will not be able to make it that time. I live 350km away from Harare and since it is starting at 3pm,  I do not have money for overnight accommodation once the event is over
15/2/24, 6:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand that you have certain concerns related to the travel and accommodation. However, I want to emphasise that this event is not just a gathering; it's an investment in your future education.

May I know if you will be able to try and make arrangements to be able to attend this event that we have specifically organized for Edoofians just like Patience? It would be our pleasure to host you at our event!
22/2/24, 2:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Patience,

I trust this message finds you well. I would like to inform you that our company will be observing holidays on Friday and Saturday, therefore, we will be unavailable during this time. Hence, we will resume our sessions on Monday.

Until then, I wish you a blessed week ahead. Kindly convey my regards to your family as well.
22/2/24, 5:48 PM - +263 77 738 3415: Hello 

I hope you and your team are doing well.
22/2/24, 5:49 PM - +263 77 738 3415: Noted .We can have the discussion when you are available. Thank you
26/2/24, 11:43 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Patience,

I hope you had a wonderful weekend. Over the weekend, our team engaged in discussions regarding the Meet and Greet Seminar, reflecting on the valuable insights gained from interacting with our students. The experience was truly enriching for us, and we hope it was equally enjoyable for you as well.

Before we proceed with our discussion today, I would like to inquire how you are doing this fine morning?
26/2/24, 1:39 PM - +263 77 688 9099: Good afternoon, we are doing fine
26/2/24, 1:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held in January, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
26/2/24, 2:30 PM - +263 77 688 9099: No, we are not familiar with that
26/2/24, 2:31 PM - +263 77 688 9099: Please update us
27/2/24, 12:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Patience,

I hope you are doing well today. Kindly excuse me for not being able to respond to your last message as I was not feeling well and had to conclude my day early. However, I am pleased to let you know that I am feeling better today and eager to proceed with our discussion. Before we do so, I would like to ask how your day has been going so far?
27/2/24, 6:18 PM - +263 77 688 9099: Good evening Ms Singh, I am sorry to learn that you were not feeling well. How are you feeling now? I hope you are now back in shape. Here, we are all doing well.
28/2/24, 3:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Patience,

I hope you are having a lovely day. I am feeling much better now, thank you for asking please. Previously, we were not able to connect with each other due to a mismatch in the timings. I would kindly request you to suggest a time slot for 1-hour during the day between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM when you will be able to have brief discussions with me? It is essential that we are able to make consistent progress in our discussions.
28/2/24, 6:18 PM - +263 77 688 9099: Good evening Ms Siddhi, I hope you had a wonderful day. Our previous Admin Officer was flexible with us. We had agreed to meet between 6.00pm and 8.00pm because of the fact that Patience will be at school during that suggested time. She will not have access to her phone because the school does not allow students to bring such gadgets. So she will be home by 6.00pm. As for the parents, we may be available here and there depending on where we will be working from. I can say, the whole family comes back home after 5.00pm.
29/2/24, 12:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Patience,

I hope you are doing well. I understand please. In such a case, could you kindly let me know if 5:00 PM will be suitable for you?
29/2/24, 5:20 PM - +263 77 688 9099: Good afternoon, yes we are at home now?
1/3/24, 10:15 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Patience,

I hope you are having a pleasant morning. My operating hours today will conclude by 4:00 PM. Hence, let us schedule our discussion for tomorrow. Since it is a Saturday, our operating hours are from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM tomorrow. In such a case, could you kindly let me know if you are going to be available during the morning tomorrow as it is a weekend? Kindly let me know about your availability such that we are able to coordinate and have a smooth discussion without any interruptions. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.
1/3/24, 10:54 AM - +263 77 688 9099: Goodmorning Ms Siddhi, we are fine. Saturday morning is fine for us. Yes, we will be available for that discussion. Thank you for the arrangement. Good day to you.
1/3/24, 10:55 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. In such a case, let us connect tomorrow at 9:00 AM for our session. I wish you a blessed day ahead!
1/3/24, 11:10 AM - +263 77 688 9099: Namaste 🙏
2/3/24, 10:27 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Patience,

I hope you are doing well this fine morning. Were you able to start off the weekend on a good note this morning?
2/3/24, 11:16 AM - +263 77 688 9099: Morning, how are you today?
2/3/24, 11:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am doing well please, thank you for asking. I am glad that we can connect today. Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held in January, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
2/3/24, 11:21 AM - +263 77 688 9099: Not really, maybe you can take us through again
2/3/24, 11:23 AM - +263 77 688 9099: Is it the admission process?
2/3/24, 11:24 AM - +263 77 688 9099: Is it the circle  that shows the processes?
2/3/24, 11:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
2/3/24, 11:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
2/3/24, 11:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
2/3/24, 11:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me share a glimpse of the conference with you and your family. I am certain that Patience too would be this excited to attend such events when she comes to India.

2/3/24, 11:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me know once you are able to go through the messages about the SLICE CON, along with the images and videos shared with you. This was indeed a momentous step for all of our students, making them employable ready and giving them access to the right opportunities for their careers ahead. We also recorded messages from these students specifically for you.

2/3/24, 11:43 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: https://youtu.be/zkWc3nMS32Q
2/3/24, 11:43 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Given the network challenges in Zimbabwe, I suggest finding a Wi-Fi location to download these videos. They offer a glimpse into life in India and will for sure resonate with your aspirations.
2/3/24, 11:44 AM - +263 77 688 9099: Yaa, wifi would be the best. Let me find a location with wifi to download. Thank you
2/3/24, 11:46 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Surely, please. In the meanwhile, let us continue with our discussion. Regarding the discussion we had the other day about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
2/3/24, 11:57 AM - +263 77 738 3415: Yes my parents and l had the opportunity and time to discuss about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan.The idea of this is very good and we agree it would really work for us but my parents are currently facing challenges here in Zimbabwe. Both of them are peasant farmers and it hasn't been going well .We are havings droughts this side so saving money has been a challenge to them because there is nothing in the fields to harvest and sell
2/3/24, 11:59 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. It is my understanding that you wish to proceed with the Financial Secure Plan, however your financial situation currently is not quite stable due to the droughts. Is my understanding correct, Patience?
2/3/24, 12:00 PM - +263 77 738 3415: Yes that is correct
2/3/24, 12:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In such a case, since you have been so dedicated and committed towards ensuring that you are able to secure a scholarship seat in the best university and your financial concerns are genuine, I will try to present your situation in front of the academic board and try to get some relaxation for your monthly deposits. I understand that the amount $150 is not feasible for you currently. In such a case, if you could let me know the amount that you will be able to afford for the next few months, we can make alterations in the deposit for the first few months, and later on when you financial situation is better, we can cover up the previous balances as we move ahead. May I know if this will be suitable for you?
2/3/24, 12:20 PM - +263 77 688 9099: Thank you for understanding our situation.  Currently, it is very difficult to pay up the balance. Our failure to come to Harare for orientation was evident enough to pick how financially stressed I am at the moment. I would be happy if you present my situation to the board
2/3/24, 12:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Surely. In such a case, could you kindly share with me what would be a feasible amount for you for the next few months until your financial situation is a bit more stable?
2/3/24, 12:23 PM - +263 77 688 9099: Ok,  I am comfortable in paying usd$20 per month
2/3/24, 12:25 PM - +263 77 688 9099: This can increase once i get another line of getting money
2/3/24, 12:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. However, may I know if you can afford up to $50 at least for the upcoming few months?
2/3/24, 12:47 PM - +263 77 688 9099: I will try to make up for that amount
2/3/24, 1:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. In such a case, allow me time till Monday to discuss the situation with my team and I will give you an update. Until then, I wish you a blessed weekend ahead and kindly extend my regards to your family as well!
2/3/24, 1:26 PM - +263 77 688 9099: Thank you too for the time. Have a nice weekend too !! Bye
4/3/24, 3:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Patience,

I hope you are having a wonderful day today. May I know if you are currently available for a brief conversation?
5/3/24, 7:50 AM - +263 77 688 9099: Morni g, I will be available in the evening, we have a funeral.
5/3/24, 9:32 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Patience,

I hope you are doing well. I understand please, I appreciate you informing us. In such a case, could you kindly share at what time you will be able to connect with me?
5/3/24, 5:18 PM - +263 77 688 9099: We are at home now
5/3/24, 5:19 PM - +263 77 688 9099: So we can connect
5/3/24, 5:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Regarding our previous discussion, I wanted to share an update with you. As you are aware, for the time being, the first cost that you will have to incur is Patience's registration fees in the month of August 2024. May I know if we are on the same page here?
5/3/24, 5:47 PM - +263 77 688 9099: Ok, what is the amount?
