I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 1:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 2:16 PM - +263 77 492 3669: Good day Mr Ashi.
Let me send my results right away.
16/1/24, 2:20 PM - +263 77 492 3669: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 6:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
16/1/24, 6:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly allow us some time to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, we will reconnect with you to discuss the next steps in your academic journey.
16/1/24, 8:04 PM - +263 77 356 2704: It is well, thank you

29/2/24, 5:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Roy,

Here at Edoofa, we're brimming with energy and excitement, all thanks to the successful meet and greet sessions we hosted at the Martin Luther King Family of Schools in Harare last week.

The entire Edoofa Team returned from Zimbabwe with a wealth of learnings, experiences, and opportunities for our students. But before I delve into the details of our experiences and the opportunities that await you and your family, I want to take a moment to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success. Your support means the world to us.
29/2/24, 5:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Even before the team returned to India, we were already eagerly planning our next visit, inspired by the incredible connections and opportunities we secured for the students of Zimbabwe.

In light of this, I am  also eager to hear about your experience at the meet and greet session. Whom were you able to connect with, and what resonated with you the most during the seminar?
29/2/24, 5:10 PM - +263 77 356 2704: Thank you very much,we really appreciate it if you did enjoy your stay and meet and greet session.
29/2/24, 5:13 PM - +263 77 356 2704: As Roy's parents,we were unable to attend to the session in Harare as we stay some 450km away in Bulawayo. However, Roy's experience was quite an enjoyable one as he managed to meet his old friends and former school mates from Sizane High School in Bulawayo. It is his testimony that he enjoyed the session so much and it was a memorable experience.
4/3/24, 11:58 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Roy,

I hope you all had a wonderful weekend. It's heartening to see how each student's journey unfolds, and our conversation today reaffirms the progress we've made as an organization with our students. Do you know how many students and parents attended the seminar over just three days?
4/3/24, 12:11 PM - +263 77 356 2704: Good Day
4/3/24, 12:13 PM - +263 77 356 2704: No,we don't know how many students and parents who attended the seminar?
4/3/24, 12:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: There were over 2700 attendees and out of these 2,700 attendees, our team had the privilege of engaging in 30-minute one-on-one sessions with 487 students, including Mr. Austin, Ms. Vilsha, Mr. Abhinav, Mr. Jyotishman, and Mr. Piyush and the directors of Edoofa.
4/3/24, 12:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: These exclusive interactions have been instrumental in guiding students forward on their educational paths. Since you couldn't attend the seminar, I have personally arranged for you to have similar exclusive access over phone calls and I will share the details of the call with you tomorrow.
4/3/24, 12:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the meantime, I am curious if you or your family members had any interactions with students or parents who attended the seminar? It would be enlightening for you to hear their perspectives and understand the overarching experience and benefits they gained from the event so that when you have your call with the team, you know exactly what you need to discuss for your education.
4/3/24, 5:31 PM - +263 77 492 3669: Good day sir
4/3/24, 5:35 PM - +263 77 492 3669: Sir I don't think there is need for you to arrange a call for us to talk to the admission team because I attended the seminar and I had the chance to talk to Ms Vilsha and Mr Austin . My parents are the ones who did not get a chance to attend the seminar because they were caught up with work but I had to make sure that I attend because I didn't want to miss out.
5/3/24, 10:01 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Roy,

I hope you are doing well please. I understand, Roy. I thought that maybe your parents would be willing to connect with other parents, hence I shared that option with you. However, if you wish to not go forward with it, that is completely understandable.
5/3/24, 10:01 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As you may recall from the seminar, you're one of the proud Edoofians who has completed the admission process, leaving only the finalization of the university and the commencement of the visa application process.
5/3/24, 10:02 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: To provide you with a recap of our discussions during the seminar:

Since the Zimsec results were released last month, we've been diligently working on your scholarship application to help you secure offer letters from various universities in India, giving you multiple options to choose from. Currently, you've received an offer letter from Gulzar Group of Institutes, and by the 15th of March, you can expect to receive the remaining offer letters as well.
5/3/24, 10:02 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you receive the offer letters, you'll have the privilege of comparing them and selecting the university that aligns best with your educational goals. Should you decide to change your university choice, you can do so with the transfer option, and any registration fees you've already paid will be adjusted accordingly.

Following the university selection, the next step will be to commence your visa application process, which will take place in April 2024l. Our Department of Student Welfare will be in touch with you to guide you through this process.
5/3/24, 10:02 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the meantime, it's essential to focus on your EWYL Program and ensure you stay connected with your mentor to upskill yourself. In case you have any queries that you would like to discuss, you can feel free to reach out to us here in your admission group and we will get back to you within the next 24 hours.
5/3/24, 11:27 AM - +263 77 492 3669: Okay thanks for the information sir.
I look forward to getting more offer letters from other universities so that I can have a wide range of choices.
