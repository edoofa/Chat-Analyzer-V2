22/2/24, 12:54 PM - +263 77 791 5550: Thank you
26/2/24, 10:34 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Munashe,

I hope you had a wonderful weekend. Over the weekend, our team engaged in discussions regarding the Meet and Greet Seminar, reflecting on the valuable insights gained from interacting with our students. The experience was truly enriching for us, and we hope it was equally enjoyable for you as well.

Before we proceed with our discussion today, I would like to inquire how you are doing this fine morning?
26/2/24, 11:52 AM - +263 77 791 5550: I'm well thank you.
26/2/24, 12:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. May I know if you are now available and back from the funeral you went to attend in Zambia?
26/2/24, 12:12 PM - +263 77 791 5550: Still in Zambia but we can proceed now
26/2/24, 12:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming your availability ma'am. Since you were unable to attend the Meet and Greet Seminar at Harare, I would encourage you to go through the videos and pictures that I have shared with you to get an idea about how the event was like and hopefully, you will be able to join us next time we have such an event. Kindly let me know once you have done so.
26/2/24, 12:22 PM - +263 77 791 5550: So interesting. If future I will attend the seminars.
26/2/24, 12:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. During our previous session, I had shared an image with you stating the 6 steps of the admission cycle. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
26/2/24, 12:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
26/2/24, 12:33 PM - +263 77 791 5550: Very clear
26/2/24, 12:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps -

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
26/2/24, 12:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
26/2/24, 1:20 PM - +263 77 791 5550: I'm following. Thank you.
26/2/24, 1:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
26/2/24, 1:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
26/2/24, 1:27 PM - +263 77 791 5550: Well understood. Thank you.
26/2/24, 1:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
26/2/24, 1:34 PM - +263 77 791 5550: Go ahead plse
26/2/24, 1:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
26/2/24, 1:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
26/2/24, 1:37 PM - +263 77 791 5550: Noted. Go ahead

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled for tomorrow after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session for tomorrow accordingly?
