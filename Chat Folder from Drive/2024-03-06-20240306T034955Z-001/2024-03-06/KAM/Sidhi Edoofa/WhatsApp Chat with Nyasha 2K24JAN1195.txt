23/1/24, 9:48 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Nyasha 2K24JAN1195)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
23/1/24, 9:48 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Nyasha EWYL23E1204)* . In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
23/1/24, 9:51 AM - +263 78 572 9674: Everything is clear
23/1/24, 9:51 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counsellor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.
23/1/24, 9:51 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counselling session with your counsellor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
23/1/24, 9:55 AM - +263 78 572 9674: The aspect that it gives quality education and the EWYL PROGRAM
23/1/24, 9:56 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you find the program to be so helpful in terms of quality education and the EWYL program.
23/1/24, 9:56 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moving forward with the procedures, I would like to share an insight with you. To ensure a seamless experience, we, as a team, have prepared essential documents that not only value your feedback but also outline the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program and the application process. You will have to review, complete, and submit these documents as instructed. 

If you are ready, shall I share a brief overview of these documents for your ease?
23/1/24, 9:58 AM - +263 78 572 9674: Yes share
23/1/24, 9:58 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Perfect! Let's delve into the documents that are crucial for your journey with Edoofa.

After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded, *please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here* so that we can cross-check our records for the same. Please let me know if you have taken note of this so that I can share the third and final form and the deadline to complete these forms.
23/1/24, 10:07 AM - +263 78 572 9674: I'm on it but network
23/1/24, 10:08 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, we can move on to the 3rd and final form, and you can go through the form once you have stable internet connection. May I know if you are ready? <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 10:11 AM - +263 78 572 9674: Yes I am
23/1/24, 10:12 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Great to hear that you've taken note of the second form as well. Now, moving on to the third and final form:

*3. EWYL Program Instructions and Pledge Document:* In the form, you will find a section where you are required to specify the date on which you intend to commence your EWYL journey. The next batch is scheduled to start on *Tuesday (30 January 2024)* . If you are enthusiastic about beginning the procedures on that particular date, please fill it in accordingly. However, if you are unavailable to commence your EWYL Journey on that date, please inform us, and we will propose an alternative date for the next session. Our aim is to align this with your availability to ensure a smooth transition.

With this form that has been shared with you, I have shared all the forms you have to submit to begin your procedures, please let me know once you have taken note of them so that we can move forward.
23/1/24, 10:14 AM - +263 78 572 9674: Okay I will let you know
23/1/24, 10:15 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Along with these forms, I had asked you to share your academic documents with us. I am currently waiting for that as well.
23/1/24, 10:15 AM - +263 78 572 9674: Okay
23/1/24, 10:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moving forward, as a part of your application file, you will need to visit your school and secure a letter of recommendation from them. We have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process.
23/1/24, 10:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, *your subject combination for A Level exams*, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
23/1/24, 10:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to inquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?
23/1/24, 10:18 AM - +263 78 572 9674: Maybe the day after tomorrow that's when our school headmaster will be available
23/1/24, 10:20 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that and I am looking forward to getting an update from your end. I would also like to reiterate that our operational hours are from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Central African Time. <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 10:20 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Considering this, for our future sessions, you have to decide on an hour’s time that suits your availability within this timeframe and share the same with us so that we can tailor our subsequent sessions to accommodate your schedule effectively.
23/1/24, 10:20 AM - +263 78 572 9674: Okay I have noted that
23/1/24, 10:20 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: For the next couple of days, we will have sessions on a daily basis and once we cover the first three steps of the admission cycle, we will have sessions scheduled on a need basis. Hence, can you let me know at what time you would like us to schedule our sessions on a daily basis (from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM)?
23/1/24, 10:43 AM - +263 78 572 9674: From half 12 to 4pm
23/1/24, 10:51 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Are you comfortable with having our session at 2:00 PM?
23/1/24, 10:52 AM - +263 78 572 9674: Yes I am
23/1/24, 10:54 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. In such a case, we will schedule tomorrow’s session at this time. It's important to note that all three forms and your academic documents with the Letter of recommendation should be completed and submitted by tomorrow before our session. 

This timeline is essential to ensure a smooth progression in the admission process and to meet the goal of concluding this session before Saturday, enabling us to assist you in initiating your EWYL process on time. I hope we are together with this?
23/1/24, 11:00 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 11:01 AM - +263 78 572 9674: Yes we are for the mean time I have to attend a lesson
23/1/24, 11:01 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 2:00 PM for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to fill out all the forms and share the documents. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed rest of the day and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
23/1/24, 11:02 AM - +263 78 572 9674: Okay I will
24/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 78 572 9674: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 78 572 9674: <Media omitted>

24/1/24, 2:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Nyasha! I hope you are having a wonderful morning. How are you all doing today? <This message was edited>
24/1/24, 2:13 PM - +263 78 572 9674: We are all doing good
24/1/24, 2:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Thank you for sharing your forms. Allow me to go through the documents once and I will let you know if there are any changes or corrections to be made.
24/1/24, 2:31 PM - +263 78 572 9674: Okay I will be waiting
24/1/24, 2:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the feedback form, I notice that you have not added your passport sized photograph and did not answer the question 5. In the EWYL form, you have mentioned the EWYL Program Availability date as 25 January and left the Orientation Availability date blank. May I know if you have any doubts regarding the same and would like my help to clarify it?
24/1/24, 2:39 PM - +263 78 572 9674: I need your help in the questions that I have left
24/1/24, 2:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the feedback form, question number 5 refers to your experience during the counselling session and how much you would rate it from 1 to 5 (1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest).
24/1/24, 2:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the EWYL form, as I have previously mentioned, your EWYL program is scheduled to begin on the 30th of January. So instead of 25 January, you are required to write 30 January.
24/1/24, 2:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The column "orientation availability" refers to a 3-day window following the commencement of your EWYL program, which, in your case, is on January 30. After the initiation, you will have a 3-day period during which you will commence your EWYL orientation, specifically from January 30 to February 3 in your situation. Your EWYL program initiation date remains January 30, and you are required to input a date between January 30 and February 3 for your Orientation program. It is permissible for both the EWYL Program availability and Orientation availability to share the same date. If you are available for the orientation on January 30 itself, kindly indicate so. I hope I am clear?
24/1/24, 2:57 PM - +263 78 572 9674: Very clear but I might have challenges in submitting them now because I have to attend a lesson from now to half 4
24/1/24, 2:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, in such a case you can submit the same by the time we conclude our session for the day. Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
24/1/24, 3:00 PM - +263 78 572 9674: I'm ready but I'm late for my chemistry lesson
24/1/24, 3:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand dear. May I know if your parents are currently available to proceed with the session?
24/1/24, 3:28 PM - +263 78 572 9674: Now I think they at work but the lesson was cancelled so we can proceed
24/1/24, 3:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 3:47 PM - +263 78 572 9674: I'm through
24/1/24, 4:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
24/1/24, 4:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
24/1/24, 4:21 PM - +263 78 572 9674: Yes I am
24/1/24, 4:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps - 

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
24/1/24, 4:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
24/1/24, 4:50 PM - +263 78 572 9674: Yes I am
24/1/24, 4:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
24/1/24, 4:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
24/1/24, 4:53 PM - +263 78 572 9674: Yes they are all clear
24/1/24, 4:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
24/1/24, 5:02 PM - +263 78 572 9674: Yes we can

3/2/24, 1:24 PM - +263 78 572 9674: Second audio it talks about the statement of purpose
Third audio talks about about the vision and plans you have for us
The fourth audio talks about the importance of the videos to me
3/2/24, 1:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
3/2/24, 1:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of tomorrow.
3/2/24, 1:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
3/2/24, 1:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
3/2/24, 1:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: would love to continue with our discussion, however my operating hours on Saturdays end at 1:00 PM. Hence, let us conclude our conversation for today and we will reconnect on Monday for our next session.

5/2/24, 10:43 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  I hope you were able to follow through with this?
5/2/24, 11:33 AM - +263 78 572 9674: Yes I was able
5/2/24, 11:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Glad to hear that.

So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow before our session.
5/2/24, 11:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier.

I hope you are having a pleasant Saturday afternoon. With the team focused on preparations for the Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare, it has been a few days since we have been able to connect on a regular basis. Hence, I am reaching out to schedule our next session on Monday between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM to catch up and ensure we are back on track. Could you please let me know a convenient one-hour time slot within that window for our discussion?
