18/12/23, 12:15 PM - You joined using this group's invite link
29/12/23, 4:06 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Ryan

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. It has been a while since the last time we were connected with each other. As I was occupied with university obligations and Christmas preparations, I would like to take this opportunity to inquire how you are doing today?
29/12/23, 6:31 PM - +263 77 382 4365: We are all well
29/12/23, 6:51 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you are available to proceed with the session for the admission process?
29/12/23, 6:54 PM - +263 77 382 4365: The boy is at school
29/12/23, 6:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright we can also proceed with the parents as well.
29/12/23, 7:16 PM - +263 77 382 4365: Ok
29/12/23, 7:19 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
29/12/23, 7:22 PM - +263 77 382 4365: We haven't yet discussed about the 10 months plan as a family
29/12/23, 8:06 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are facing any challenges?
29/12/23, 8:55 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>

2/1/24, 6:33 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Eevning dear parent and my dear student!

I hope you had your wonderful holidays with your loved ones. As we embark on a furitful fresh new year. May I know if you are now reay to proceed with the session for the admisison process for today?
2/1/24, 7:21 PM - +263 77 382 4365: Yes
2/1/24, 7:51 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
2/1/24, 8:22 PM - +263 77 382 4365: Yes
2/1/24, 9:25 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: As my available hours are coming to an end. I would like to let you know that I am now closing my session for today and let us proceed with the session tomorrow. Have a great night and my warm regards to your lovely family.
3/1/24, 6:37 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well and blessed. May I know if you are currently available to proceed with the session?
3/1/24, 7:02 PM - +263 77 382 4365: Yes
3/1/24, 7:43 PM - +263 71 726 1775: Sorry to answer you late.I think you can proceed
3/1/24, 7:55 PM - +263 71 726 1775: We are of the view that Ryan must work hard and score very high so that he will be given a high scholarship percentage.We him to score veryhigh
3/1/24, 8:37 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
3/1/24, 8:37 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
3/1/24, 8:37 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
4/1/24, 6:07 AM - +263 77 382 4365: Sounds good
4/1/24, 6:21 AM - +263 71 726 1775: I understand you say in the eleventh month we will be asked to open MasterCard bank account here in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. This account will help in Visa application.
You say depositing $1500 for the remaining 10 months might be expensive. So we will deposit only for four months. How much will that be? And when will the balance from $1500 paid?
4/1/24, 8:48 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That will be a total of $150 x 4 which is $600.
6/1/24, 11:25 AM - Shivjeet Edoofa added Dev Edoofa
6/1/24, 11:33 AM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, Parents of Ryan,

6/1/24, 11:33 AM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the same spirit, I would like to share that I am embarking on a journey as I prepare myself to pursue my doctorate and take a step forward in my academic pursuits. This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.
6/1/24, 11:33 AM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The decision to transition to a new phase in my life presents an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of students, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience remain enriched and fulfilling.

Mr. Shiveet

6/1/24, 11:39 AM - +263 77 382 4365: Wish all the best sir.
9/1/24, 9:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ryan,

I am *Mr. Dev Kumar, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honored to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realizing your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
9/1/24, 9:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
9/1/24, 9:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test. This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
9/1/24, 9:43 PM - Dev Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
10/1/24, 6:52 AM - +263 77 382 4365: That's great
10/1/24, 6:53 AM - +263 77 382 4365: We started 2024 very well sir
10/1/24, 6:54 AM - +263 77 382 4365: Happy to have you on this platform
12/1/24, 10:16 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to know that you had a great start to the year and I hope you are excited for the new day and most importantly the new year as well. @263773824365 , the new year brings about a transformative mindset in us which may not emphasize immediate changes but a change in the direction that you believe is needed.

If I talk about myself, I have made a resolution to bring more humility in myself and bring about a change in my perspective to be a better version of myself all while ensuring that I help all of our students to achieve their educational goals. With that said, I would like to know what aspirations or a change in your approach towards life you wish to achieve? <This message was edited>
12/1/24, 10:41 AM - +263 77 382 4365: As of myself I want my son to aquire good course in your country
12/1/24, 4:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are determined to provide your children with as many opportunities as you to see them become successful individuals. It is appreciated.
12/1/24, 4:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, moving toward the admission process, We, at Edoofa, are determined to provide affordable higher education to hardworking students and assist them in launching their careers to greater heights. We will be able to help you only if we can connect timely and have healthy discussions.
12/1/24, 4:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, this is something I want to inform you all that the agenda for the discussions, that we are going to have, is to help you all understand the process you will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since you are going to be occupied with school and your parents are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
12/1/24, 4:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January]. This way, we can align it with our availability as well and help you move forward and make progress in a streamlined manner. Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your input and find the right time for our sessions.
12/1/24, 10:03 PM - +263 71 139 3748: 1PM to 6PM will be fine
13/1/24, 6:16 AM - +263 71 726 1775: 5pm-6pm
25/1/24, 4:13 PM - +263 71 726 1775: Hi there. What is the position now
26/1/24, 9:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Ryan,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa*. Recently I was having a discussion with the Academic Board. They highlighted  that you have not been able to proceed with your admission process in a timely manner, since your child is at school and you have been occupied with work. Hence, I pitched in that I will be able to help you out and take over your application profile so that together we can ensure a timely and smooth progress. Since my operational hours accommodate your timings more suitably, I will be assuming the duties of your admission officer. I am optimistic that together, we can pave the way for an auspicious beginning to your academic journey, resulting in the right career prospects and eventual success for both you and your family.
26/1/24, 9:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

26/1/24, 9:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: On this auspicious note, I would like to extend my heartiest regards to you and your family, and I hope that just like my proud nation, we will work unitedly and make progress in your admission process to ensure that you are able to realise your dream of pursuing higher education here in India. I would like to schedule our session for 9:30 AM tomorrow, so that we can discuss the progress and the next steps to be taken for your admission journey.
27/1/24, 9:40 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Ryan. I hope you are having a lovely morning. How are you all doing today?
27/1/24, 9:51 AM - +263 77 382 4365: We are good
27/1/24, 9:51 AM - +263 77 382 4365: And you
27/1/24, 9:59 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are doing good. I am doing fine myself, thank you for asking. Since this is the first time we are interacting, allow me to introduce myself. I am Miss Siddhi Singh, your Admission Officer. I belong from the vibrant city of Varanasi, known as one of the oldest living cities globally, Beyond my passion for education, I find joy in music and playing basketball. It is my pleasure to assist and guide you through the admission process, ensuring you achieve your dream education in India with the support of Edoofa.
27/1/24, 10:08 AM - +263 77 382 4365: Glad to hear that too
27/1/24, 10:25 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The pleasure is mine. I was going through your application profile and it is my understanding that you were successfully introduced to Edoofa's Financial Secure Plan. May I know if I am correct?
27/1/24, 10:32 AM - +263 77 382 4365: Yes but we  were not answered some of the   questions which we asked
27/1/24, 10:35 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. You may share your queries and thoughts with me, so that I am able to understand it better and together we can come up with an appropriate solution for you.
27/1/24, 10:38 AM - +263 77 382 4365: Yes. But we are yet to fully understand how it operates
27/1/24, 10:40 AM - +263 77 382 4365: If you can please shed more light about it
27/1/24, 10:42 AM - +263 77 382 4365: I mean the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan
27/1/24, 10:56 AM - +263 77 382 4365: Congratulations!!!!
75 years of independence you have indeed come a long way as a Nation.
27/1/24, 11:22 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your kind wishes. I understand that you wish to get more clarity on the Financial Secure Plan. In such a case, since Ryan has school during the weekdays and you are occupied with work, could you kindly suggest a 1-hour slot between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM on Monday when we can further discuss about the same?
27/1/24, 12:21 PM - +263 77 382 4365: 1pm - 2pm
27/1/24, 1:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. In such a case, we will conclude our conversation for today and reconnect on Monday at 1:00 PM to further discuss the financial plan and your application process. Until then, please take care and kindly extend my regards to your family as well!
27/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 77 382 4365: Thank you
29/1/24, 1:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ryan. I hope you are all doing well. How has your day been going so far?
29/1/24, 1:20 PM - +263 77 382 4365: So far so good Ms
29/1/24, 1:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. During our previous conversation, you mentioned that you wish to get more clarity on the Financial Secure Plan. May I know which aspect do you want me to shed more light?
29/1/24, 2:19 PM - +263 77 382 4365: I heard about paying 150 us instalment per month for 10 months hw do you go about it.
29/1/24, 2:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know if you are inquiring about the payment mode or the payment plan?
29/1/24, 2:53 PM - +263 77 382 4365: Yes i am inquiring about the payment plan
29/1/24, 3:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500.
29/1/24, 3:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
29/1/24, 3:27 PM - +263 77 382 4365: That's very good
29/1/24, 3:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
29/1/24, 3:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
29/1/24, 3:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
29/1/24, 3:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
29/1/24, 4:07 PM - +263 77 382 4365: If it is money it's a good idea
29/1/24, 4:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
29/1/24, 4:43 PM - +263 71 726 1775: Yes,  sure we are wondering what be happening in the next ten months
29/1/24, 5:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
29/1/24, 5:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
29/1/24, 5:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
29/1/24, 5:24 PM - +263 77 382 4365: It sound good
29/1/24, 5:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As much as I would like to continue with our discussion, since my operational hours for the day have already concluded and I have had a long day, I would like to reconnect with you tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the Financial Secure Plan and admission process. Until then, please take care and have a blessed day ahead!
29/1/24, 6:25 PM - +263 71 726 1775: Thank you so much Ms Siddh.
30/1/24, 5:47 AM - +263 71 726 1775: So this another $1500 will be for what? Is it to go towards the University fees as well in the first 10 months or the second 10 months?
30/1/24, 1:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
30/1/24, 1:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ryan. I hope everything is well on your end. Thank you for sharing your query with me. Allow me to help you understand the Financial Secure Plan in a better way. After the completion of the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month of the plan, during which you will be required to deposit money in your newly opened account, the remaining months you will have the option to save the money in your bank account or with us. The 4 months' deposit in the bank ensure that your bank statements complete the VISA requirement. If you decide to deposit your money with us after the completion of the 4 months, it will be used for Ryan's higher education expense exclusively. I hope this helps with your query?
30/1/24, 1:51 PM - +263 77 382 4365: I hear you thank you
30/1/24, 2:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad that you found it helpful. Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
30/1/24, 2:14 PM - +263 77 382 4365: Yes we understand maam
30/1/24, 2:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their family the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
30/1/24, 3:12 PM - +263 77 382 4365: We wl come back to you when we through with our discussion
30/1/24, 3:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you tomorrow to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
30/1/24, 4:18 PM - +263 71 726 1775: Thank you. All the best
31/1/24, 1:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ryan

Please, how are you doing today? With regards to our discussion yesterday, I wanted to reach out and enquire if you are available for us to have a brief conversation?
31/1/24, 1:58 PM - +263 77 382 4365: Yes I am available
31/1/24, 2:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are doing well and are available for us to connect with each other. Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held last week, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
31/1/24, 2:29 PM - +263 77 382 4365: I am not familiar with it if I may know from you
31/1/24, 2:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
31/1/24, 2:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
31/1/24, 2:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
31/1/24, 2:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me share a glimpse of the conference with you and your family. I am certain that Ryan too would be this excited to attend such events when he comes to India.

31/1/24, 2:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me know once you are able to go through the messages about the SLICE CON, along with the images and videos shared with you. This was indeed a momentous step for all of our students, making them employable ready and giving them access to the right opportunities for their careers ahead.
31/1/24, 3:19 PM - +263 77 382 4365: This is wonderful indeed.
31/1/24, 4:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly. Also, regarding the discussion we had the other day about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
31/1/24, 5:09 PM - +263 77 382 4365: Yes the questions are if I am no able to pay 150 us per month for ten months but wl be able to pay the full amount of 1500 within those 10 mths maybe paying 500 500 500 for the space of those 10 mths.
31/1/24, 6:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. It is possible that we can customize the plan according to your needs, however in such a case you will have to begin with a payment of $500. In such a case, you will not be required to make the next payment until 3 and a half months later, when you will be required to make a payment of $500 again.

However, I am failing to understand why you think you will not be able to raise an amount of $150 for 10 months. Could you kindly help me understand it better?
31/1/24, 6:20 PM - +263 77 382 4365: Here in Zimbabwe money is a problem we have other kids who are doing tertiary education so it's a matter balancing finances
31/1/24, 7:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand. Thank you for sharing that with me. In such a case, does the above mentioned method sound suitable to you?
31/1/24, 7:22 PM - +263 71 726 1775: Instead of $500.I think $600 isa round figure more easier work with. Meaning to say we will have to wait for four months before making another payment, isn't it?
1/2/24, 10:05 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Ryan. I hope you are having a wonderful day. Kindly excuse me for being unable to respond to your message last night as our operational hours had already concluded.
1/2/24, 10:06 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. That would mean that your payment plan will be as per the following:

1st Installment - February - $600
2nd Installment - June - $600
3rd Installment - October - $300

May I know if you find this to be suitable?
1/2/24, 10:51 AM - +263 71 726 1775: Yes it's fine.
1/2/24, 11:12 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that, your commitment to securing a seat in this exclusive program is appreciated.

1/2/24, 1:01 PM - +263 71 726 1775: I don't have a specific date now but sometime this coming week if my sales go well.
1/2/24, 1:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In order to draft an agreement, we are required to include dates. Since you are unsure about when you will be able to accumulate the resources, is it suitable for you if the monthly deposit date for the months of February, June and October be set for the end of month i.e., 30th? You can make the payment before the mentioned date as well. <This message was edited>

I hope this message finds you well. As promised, we have prepared the official agreement for the Financial Secure Plan based on the details you provided. You can find the attached agreement document.
2/2/24, 3:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

3/2/24, 3:12 PM - +263 71 726 1775: Afternoon Ms Siddh

What is the range of the University fees after receiving a scholarship percentage?
5/2/24, 1:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ryan.

I hope you all had a great weekend. Kindly excuse me for being unable to respond to your last message as our operational hours on Saturdays are from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM. 

The range of your whole cost of education will be from $2000 to $3000.
5/2/24, 4:49 PM - +263 71 726 1775: Is this after the scholarship percentage deduction or not?
When you say whole cost do you mean until completion of the degree program?
5/2/24, 5:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The $2000 to $3000 range includes your tuition fees, accommodation charges, food charges, exam fees, library fees, Wi-Fi charges, electricity and water chargers, etc. per annum. This amount is generally $6000 to $8000. With the help of Edoofa scholarship, it has been brought down to $2000 to $3000.
5/2/24, 5:31 PM - +263 71 726 1775: So you mean after paying the $1500 I may be called up to top up to$2000 or $3000?
5/2/24, 5:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: No, the $1500 is included in the $2000 to $3000 range of your first year of expenditure. Essentially, the plan is helping you to save up for Ryan's first year of education from now on so that you do not face any financial constraints later on. <This message was edited>
5/2/24, 5:50 PM - +263 71 726 1775: So, that's precisely what I wanted to understand that if I paid the $1500 I will still have a balance of $500 or anything upto $1500.🤷‍♂️
6/2/24, 10:21 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Ryan.

I hope that you are all doing well today. I was unable to respond to your last message as our operational hours had already concluded. I understand your query please. Allow me to help you understand the fee breakup with the help of an example:
6/2/24, 10:22 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

$2000 - $3000 Range: Reg $500 to $1000:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*

Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800).
6/2/24, 10:22 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.

Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two instalments of $900 each. The initial instalment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India.
6/2/24, 10:22 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly instalments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
6/2/24, 5:14 PM - +263 71 726 1775: So if I manage to contribute a total of $1500 under the financial ssecure plan plus registration fee of $1000 I will be required to pay only $300 to add up to $2800 which is the first year cost of education?
6/2/24, 5:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The $1500 accumulated with the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan will account towards your registration fee ($1000 as per the above example) and your remaining fee for your first semester ($900 as per the above example). In case there is still some amount left, you can use the same to pay your dues for the next semester as well. I hope this is clear?
6/2/24, 5:40 PM - +263 71 726 1775: Yes, thank you so much for your explanations, Ms Siddhi
6/2/24, 5:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome. I would like to continue with our discussion however my operational hours ended at 5:00 PM. Hence, let us conclude our conversation for today and we will reconnect at our scheduled time tomorrow to continue with our discussion.

Have a blessed evening!
6/2/24, 5:49 PM - +263 77 382 4365: 👏👏
7/2/24, 10:34 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Ryan

I hope this message finds you well and filled with the same excitement that's buzzing here at Edoofa! It's that time of the year again when we eagerly anticipate our annual Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare. This event holds a special place in our hearts as it brings us closer to our community, and we're counting down the days with great anticipation!
7/2/24, 10:34 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Just like clockwork, we're gearing up for the seminar next week, and I couldn't resist sharing our enthusiasm with you. Your presence would truly make the event all the more meaningful, guiding you on your journey to India. Hence, with immense joy, we wanted to extend the special invitation for the Meet and Greet Seminar to you and your wonderful family.
7/2/24, 10:34 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: And in the process of doing the same, I happened to notice that you haven't started your EWYL Program by now. In light of this, I had a discussion with Ms. Sanjana, the head of the EWYL Department, and I am happy to share that she has graciously agreed to make a special exception for you, expediting your application process.
7/2/24, 10:34 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As a result, I have gone ahead and created your very own dedicated EWYL Group - *Ryan EWYL23E0915*, adding both you and your parents to the mix. If I have missed including any other family members, they can easily join using the following link: [https://chat.whatsapp.com/KQJXDeSfxFx9LLogLV2fo8].

Within the group, the EWYL team will not only guide you on the hows and whens of the EWYL Program but also share all the exciting details about the upcoming Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare. We are genuinely thrilled to witness you embark on this transformative journey, and we are rooting for your success every step of the way!

Warmest regards,
Admissions Team.
8/2/24, 11:59 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Ryan.

I hope you are all doing wonderful today. It has been a few days since I shared the agreement with you, and we have had some discussions about it and addressed your queries. If there are no further questions or concerns, could you please confirm if you find the agreement to be accurate and acceptable? <This message was edited>
8/2/24, 12:38 PM - +263 71 726 1775: Afternoon Ms Siddhi Singh

Yes we have gone through the agreement form. However, I am not understand the table of instalments. Eg, if I pay$600 on the 29 February what is that penalty of $30 for?

The issue of the compounding bonus is particularly attractive may you please shed more light about it!
8/2/24, 12:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Surely, allow me to help you with your queries. The penalty amount has been allotted against each month to ensure that you are able to complete the monthly installments in a timely manner before the deadline date. According to your example, if your deadline date is 29 February and you make your deposit on 29 February itself, the penalty will not be added to your profile. Moreover, you have the flexibility to make the payment anytime between the previous and the upcoming deadline.
8/2/24, 12:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The compound bonus refers to the savings you are achieving choosing to save with Edoofa rather than a bank. Typically, banks charge a monthly "bank fee," amounting to approximately $15 based on your deposit amount. Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, not only do you get to save an amount of $150 overall, along with that you are getting a waiver of $150. In recognition of the commitment demonstrated by you through timely installment payments, you will be eligible for the $150 waiver. 

I hope this helps with your query sir.
8/2/24, 1:22 PM - +263 71 726 1775: Explanations acknowledged.
The agreement is acceptable. It's only that our economy here in Zimbabwe is volatile and one can't predict with certainty what its state will be in the next 10-20 months.We will however, always try to send our instalments within the stipulated dates.
8/2/24, 1:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand sir. That is also one of the factors that we considered while curating the Financial Secure Plan. The dollar rate is subject to fluctuations, and any economic inflation within the next year could result in increased expenses compared to the current rates. 

I appreciate your cooperation. If there are no further questions or concerns, could you please confirm if you can now proceed with signing the document?
8/2/24, 2:42 PM - +263 71 726 1775: Yes the document will be printed out, signed scanned and send to you soon.
8/2/24, 3:13 PM - +263 71 726 1775: <Media omitted>

I hope you are all doing great. It has been a while since we last connected, and our team has had quite hectic past few days. As you already know, over the past three days, Team Edoofa has been bustling with activity – both in India and Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. Now that things have settled down a bit, I wanted to express my sincere gratitude to you for participating in the event and playing a role in its success. I would like to share a few glimpses of the seminar with you, which demonstrates how enthusiastic and engaged our students were!

21/2/24, 4:00 PM - +263 71 726 1775: Afternoon

The event was awesome. It taught us a lot of things.

We got to understand more about the Founder and Director Mr Anahd Sighn.He is an honest man. He endeavoured to provide best answers to questions that were posed. His unbiased, honest and frank answers won me over.eg, like how answered about racial discrimination!

I was particularly pleased to learn that Mr Austin is a born again Christian! The issue of religion was topical here. It was excellently dealt with.

The hosting of the Meet and Greet Seminar itself gave your organisation such credibility which can not be disputed by an normal person.

The attitude and friendliness shown by your staff was great! Here in Africa one's attitude determines one's altitude. Edoofa team's behaviour was in sync with our culture.

I salute you.

PS: A few moments after I got into the venue my phone's battery went flat. Because of that I wasn't able to capture any picture save for this short clip video.
21/2/24, 4:00 PM - +263 71 726 1775: <Media omitted>
21/2/24, 4:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your kind words sir. Your appreciation only motivates us to work harder and better for the sake of our students. I am pleased to hear that you had an amazing experience and that according to you we were able to uphold the integrity of both the Indian and African cultures alike. We look forward to hosting more such events!
21/2/24, 4:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, regarding the Financial Secure Plan agreement, we are thrilled to acknowledge the receipt of the signed document from your end. Your prompt action is appreciated, and it signifies our joint commitment to moving forward effectively.

With the document in our possession, we are now prepared to proceed with the next steps. As mentioned earlier, one crucial aspect we need to address is the payment method for your monthly deposits.

Furthermore, please note that the deadline for the payment will be *29 February 2024*. This will be the recurring date for your monthly deposits. May I know if you are currently available to discuss the payment methods?
21/2/24, 4:14 PM - +263 71 726 1775: Suggestions

I hope you have been doing well. I wanted to reach out and share a gentle reminder that the deadline for the upcoming monthly deposit for the Financial Secure Plan is approaching on *29 February 2024*. As we're nearing the deadline, I wanted to check in and inquire about how your preparations for the deposit are going. If you have any questions or need assistance, please feel free to reach out to me.

28/2/24, 10:43 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Ryan,

I hope you are having a lovely morning today. Thank you for sharing the payment receipt with me. I noticed that the payment amount is $675, which is higher than the usual monthly installment of $150. Could you kindly clarify the reasoning behind this payment, sir?
28/2/24, 10:57 AM - +263 77 382 4365: I understand please. That would mean that your payment plan will be as per the following:

1st Installment - February - $600
2nd Installment - June - $600
3rd Installment - October - $300

May I know if you find this to be suitable?
28/2/24, 10:58 AM - +263 77 382 4365: That's what we agreed because we have other children who fees
28/2/24, 11:05 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand sir. Kindly excuse me for the confusion from my end and thank you for bringing that to my attention. I have duly taken a note of your payment receipt and will share a confirmation from the accounts team as soon as we receive an update. 

Once confirmed, your next payment will be due in the month of June. I hope we are together in this?
28/2/24, 11:11 AM - +263 77 382 4365: Yes June
28/2/24, 11:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. I wish you a blessed week ahead!
28/2/24, 12:40 PM - +263 71 726 1775: Thank you for taking note of it.

However, I pray that you *highlight* it with the accounts department so as to **avoid confusion* in the future.
28/2/24, 12:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Surely sir. The agreement has already been finalized after you sent us the signed copy and we will be abiding by the same. Rest assured, the confusion will not be repeated. We will reconnect once again in a few days' time. Until then, I wish you a blessed week and kindly extend my regards to your family as well.
28/2/24, 12:45 PM - +263 71 726 1775: Thank you so much, Ms Siddhi Singh.
28/2/24, 12:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome, sir.
5/3/24, 4:18 PM - +263 71 726 1775: How are you Ms Siddhi Singh

I hope you are now fully recovered.

I write to check on the confirmation of receipt of $600 payment that I made on 27 February, have you received it?
5/3/24, 4:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ryan,

I hope you are doing well too. I am much better now, thank you for asking. The accounts team is working on the confirmation of your payment and I will share an update as soon as they are able to do the same.
