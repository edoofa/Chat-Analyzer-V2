I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
2/3/24, 1:42 PM - +260 96 8297698: Yes I am.
2/3/24, 1:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end.

2/3/24, 1:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counselling session with your counsellor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?

2/3/24, 2:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
4/3/24, 3:54 PM - +260 96 8297698: Yes we may.
4/3/24, 3:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
4/3/24, 3:56 PM - +260 96 8297698: I have read through.
4/3/24, 3:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
4/3/24, 3:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
4/3/24, 3:58 PM - +260 96 8297698: Yes they are.
4/3/24, 4:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counselling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counselling session will take about 1 hour.
4/3/24, 4:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
4/3/24, 4:10 PM - +260 96 8297698: Yes I am.
4/3/24, 4:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
4/3/24, 4:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
4/3/24, 4:22 PM - +260 96 8297698: Yes they are.
4/3/24, 4:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
4/3/24, 4:28 PM - +260 96 8297698: Yes please.
4/3/24, 4:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
4/3/24, 4:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding during tomorrow’s session. You may take today’s time for the same. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
4/3/24, 4:35 PM - +260 96 8297698: Yes you can share the videos. <This message was edited>

5/3/24, 12:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. During our previous session, I had shared 4 videos containing messages from the founder's office. May I know if you were able to go through all of them and understand the intended message?
5/3/24, 12:01 PM - +260 96 8297698: Yes I was able to go through all of them and I understood the intended message.
5/3/24, 12:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. To discuss the videos and the importance of the message shared by the founders, could you kindly share your understanding of each video with me?
5/3/24, 12:05 PM - +260 96 8297698: In the first video they shared 2 important qualities of successful edoofians and these are being open minded and following instructions.
5/3/24, 12:13 PM - +260 96 8297698: In the second video I understood that edoofa's vision for students is not only to get them admitted in a university but also to get them employed and build their capacity to hold success from a cup and make it to a gigantic tank  thus  making them  more responsible and independent students <This message was edited>
5/3/24, 12:19 PM - +260 96 8297698: In the third video I understood why and how edoofa chose the Universities they work with and they did this by assessing the quality of the teaching stuff as well as the opportunities given to the students, I understood that they invested alot of time to indentify the Universities and came up with the most prestigious universities.
5/3/24, 12:22 PM - +260 96 8297698: And in the last video I understood why the statement of purpose is important and this is because it is an opportunity to convince the admission board as well any other school that I am actually eligible for the program or the scholarship and it the opportunity to make the best first impression. <This message was edited>
5/3/24, 12:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
5/3/24, 12:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of tomorrow.
5/3/24, 12:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
5/3/24, 12:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
5/3/24, 12:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
5/3/24, 12:57 PM - +260 96 8297698: Yes we are.
5/3/24, 1:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow before our session.
5/3/24, 1:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

Once you share these documents and complete the two tasks that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process. Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us tomorrow? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.

5/3/24, 1:34 PM - +260 96 8297698: Wishing you a blessed night too.
