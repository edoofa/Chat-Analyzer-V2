26/1/24, 9:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Bradley,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa*. Recently I was having a discussion with the Academic Board. They highlighted  that you have not been able to proceed with your admission process in a timely manner, since your child is at school and you have been occupied with work. Hence, I pitched in that I will be able to help you out and take over your application profile so that together we can ensure a timely and smooth progress. Since my operational hours accommodate your timings more suitably, I will be assuming the duties of your admission officer. I am optimistic that together, we can pave the way for an auspicious beginning to your academic journey, resulting in the right career prospects and eventual success for both you and your family.

I hope you are all doing great. It has been a while since we last connected, and our team has had quite hectic past few days. As you already know, over the past three days, Team Edoofa has been bustling with activity – both in India and Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. Now that things have settled down a bit, I wanted to express my sincere gratitude to you for participating in the event and playing a role in its success. I would like to share a few glimpses of the seminar with you, which demonstrates how enthusiastic and engaged our students were!

I hope you are doing well today. How has your day been going so far?
5/3/24, 1:47 PM - +263 77 405 9139: My day has been ok and yours
5/3/24, 2:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. My day has been going well, thank you for asking. We at Edoofa are filled with energy and excitement which has been fueled by the successful meet and greet sessions we hosted at the Martin Luther King Family of Schools, Harare last week. 

The entire Edoofa Team returned from Zimbabwe with a wealth of learnings, experiences, and opportunities for our students. Before I get into our experiences and the opportunities we were able to secure for our students, I wanted to check in and see if you were able to attend the seminar?
5/3/24, 2:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I checked our records, but unfortunately, I could not find your RSVP status. It is possible that there may have been an oversight, and so I wanted to reach out to you and your family directly to confirm.

Could you please let me know if you were able to attend the seminar and meet with us in your home country?
5/3/24, 2:34 PM - +263 78 374 0287: Yes
5/3/24, 2:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's fantastic to hear, and thank you for letting me know, I will update our records accordingly! The past month has been a whirlwind for Team Edoofa, both in India and in Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. 

Now that the team is back and we've had a chance to catch our breath, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success. I am eager to hear about your experience at the meet and greet session. Whom were you able to connect with, and how do you envision your educational journey progressing from here?
5/3/24, 3:26 PM - +263 77 405 9139: The experience was most enjoyable I was able to connect with the senior edoofians who are going next year and the way the spoke to me as if they already knew who I was they treated me as family they also filled in some of the gaps whix I had in mind and also the meet n greet was amazing in the sense that the ceo was able to comfort us n we also so the other side of India insuring us that once we leave we will be able to continue without harm to us n we will also have another family on the other side.The only saddening part of the meet and greet was that I was unable to meet my mentor on face to face bases but I am happy and proud to be an Edoofian ❤️
5/3/24, 3:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It's heartening to see how each student's journey unfolds, and our conversation today reaffirms the progress we've made as an organization with our students. I am pleased to hear that you had such an amazing experience at the seminar. Do you know how many students and parents attended the seminar over just three days?
5/3/24, 3:33 PM - +263 77 405 9139: Not exactly sure because when we went on Saturday there were a lot of people though
5/3/24, 3:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Bradley, there were over 2700 attendees and out of these 2,700 attendees, our team had the privilege of engaging in 30-minute one-on-one sessions with 487 students, including Mr. Austin, Ms. Vilsha, Mr. Abhinav, Mr. Jyotishman, and Mr. Piyush and the directors of Edoofa.
5/3/24, 3:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: These exclusive interactions have been instrumental in guiding students forward on their educational paths. Additionally, I would like to share some impactful videos with you. One highlight was our rendition of the industrial visit, SLICE-CON, showcasing how our Indian Edoofians are prepared for the professional world. We also recorded messages from these students specifically for you.

Given the network challenges in Zimbabwe, I suggest finding a Wi-Fi location to download these videos. They offer a glimpse into life in India and will for sure resonate with your aspirations.

Now, while I have a plethora of insights from the seminar to share with you, I recognize that we are already approaching March, with academic classes commencing in August. With this timeline in mind, I am keen to hear about your educational plans. Have you and your family been able to discuss your aspirations and next steps for your university education in the past couple of days?
5/3/24, 3:49 PM - +263 77 405 9139: What do u mean by next steps?
5/3/24, 3:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I mean to ask if you have been able to decide on a plan on how you want to move forward with your higher education journey?
5/3/24, 3:53 PM - +263 77 405 9139: Considering the scholarship or
5/3/24, 3:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Surely, Bradley. Considering the scholarship and beyond that as well, how you envision on unfolding your higher education journey in the future.
5/3/24, 6:18 PM - +263 77 405 9139: I see a future in technological engineering
