I hope you are having a lovely day. Thank you for introducing yourself to me. It's a pleasure to learn more about you and your family.

Allow me to introduce myself. I am Miss Siddhi Singh, your Admission Officer. I belong from the vibrant city of Varanasi, known as one of the oldest living cities globally. Beyond my passion for education, I find joy in music and playing basketball. It is my pleasure to assist and guide you through the admission process, ensuring you achieve your dream education in India with the support of Edoofa. <This message was edited>
7/2/24, 12:29 PM - +263 77 305 2518: Well noted with thanks.
7/2/24, 1:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Since this is your admissions group, I believe you must have added your parents to the group. This will help them become familiar with the admission process and enable them to participate when required. Could you please confirm if they have already been added to the group?
7/2/24, 1:30 PM - +263 77 305 2518: Both parents are in the group
7/2/24, 2:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. May I know your parents' names and the number they would be using in this group to connect with us?
7/2/24, 2:09 PM - +263 77 305 2518: Currently, you are talking  to Deans father .
His mom's number is +263773137364
7/2/24, 2:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that sir. Moving forward, I would like to bring an important aspect to your attention. The collective aim that we have for the student strongly values balanced involvement from parents, especially when the student is unable to participate. Your proactive engagement holds significant weight, and if, for any reason, either you or your guardians won't be available, we kindly request you to inform us beforehand so that we can plan and schedule our discussion beforehand. I hope you have taken note of this as well?
7/2/24, 2:52 PM - +263 77 305 2518: Noted
7/2/24, 3:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
7/2/24, 3:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Dean 2K23DEC0777)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
7/2/24, 3:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Dean EWYL23E1055)* . In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
7/2/24, 3:20 PM - +263 77 305 2518: It sounds clear.
7/2/24, 3:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
7/2/24, 3:25 PM - +263 77 305 2518: Considering the arrangement on this side , I think it will be ideal to start the discussions from 16.00hrs,because by that time  Dean will have finished his lessons.
7/2/24, 3:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In such a case, we will reconnect in the next 20 minutes so that Dean can also join us.
7/2/24, 3:40 PM - +263 77 305 2518: Yes ,yes
7/2/24, 4:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly let me know once @263781820058 is available for the session so I can proceed with the discussion.
7/2/24, 4:14 PM - +263 78 182 0058: Hie ,im available now
7/2/24, 4:41 PM - +263 77 305 2518: Dean is now available
7/2/24, 4:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Let us move forward with our discussion.
7/2/24, 4:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
7/2/24, 4:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
7/2/24, 5:09 PM - +263 78 182 0058: Done
7/2/24, 5:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
7/2/24, 5:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
7/2/24, 5:41 PM - +263 77 305 2518: It seems everything is  clear
7/2/24, 5:46 PM - +263 78 182 0058: Yes its clear
7/2/24, 5:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps - 

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
7/2/24, 5:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
7/2/24, 6:17 PM - +263 78 182 0058: Yae proceed
8/2/24, 4:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tadiwanashe.

I hope you are all doing wonderful today. It is now time for our session, and I hope that you are available to join. How is everything with you today?
8/2/24, 4:24 PM - +263 77 305 2518: Afternoon. Point of correction: It's not Tadiwanashe it's Dean Zinyowa
8/2/24, 4:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the confusion please. I am currently having sessions with multiple students right now due to which I made an error in typing. During our previous discussion, we had discussed the first 4 steps of the admission cycle. If you are ready, shall we proceed with the next steps?
8/2/24, 5:03 PM - +263 77 305 2518: Yes, we can proceed .
8/2/24, 5:12 PM - +263 78 182 0058: We can proceed
8/2/24, 5:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
8/2/24, 5:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
8/2/24, 5:34 PM - +263 78 182 0058: Yes its clear
8/2/24, 6:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, we shall start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office* tomorrow during our session at 4:00 PM. Since my operational hours have already concluded, let us conclude our discussion here and we will reconnect tomorrow for our session.

Have a blessed night!

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
9/2/24, 5:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?

12/2/24, 1:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
12/2/24, 1:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of tomorrow.
12/2/24, 1:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
12/2/24, 1:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
12/2/24, 1:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose. I hope you were able to follow through with this?
12/2/24, 4:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: @263773052518 may I know if we are still connected?
12/2/24, 4:25 PM - +263 77 305 2518: Just waiting for  Dean to get connected
12/2/24, 4:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. However, my operational hours are going to end soon. In such a case, may I know if you are available to participate in our session on Dean's behalf?
12/2/24, 4:57 PM - +263 77 305 2518: Yaa sure
12/2/24, 5:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Glad to hear that. Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the task by tomorrow before our session.
12/2/24, 5:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

12/2/24, 5:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Along with these tasks, I want you to share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

12/2/24, 5:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/2/24, 5:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, *your subject combination for A Level exams*, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.

The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to inquire by when will you be able to share the documents with us?
12/2/24, 6:19 PM - +263 77 305 2518: We have to make sure the letter is done by end of day tomorrow.

16/2/24, 2:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: While we were having multiple conversations with our students in the past few days for the meet & greet event, we figured that there is a slight confusion in the invitation dates. Hence, I wanted to quickly reach out and ensure that the same is not the case with you.

- As per the invitation, you are supposed to attend the event along with your parents on 17th of February which is tomorrow. 
- If you are recommending any of your friends(Non Edoofians) along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for 18th of February(8am/1pm) or 19th  February(1pm). They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event.
16/2/24, 2:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Please ensure that you are present at the venue 30 minutes earlier and are dressed appropriately.

Cannot wait to see you there tomorrow! Hope you're excited too! 😃🕺🏻
16/2/24, 2:32 PM - +263 78 182 0058: So am i going to write an exam tomorrow or ...🤷‍♂️
17/2/24, 1:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Dean,

Since the admit cards have been automatically generated through a software, due to some technical error it has mentioned "Do not communicate with fellow candidates during examination" instead of *"Kindly do not communicate with fellow students during the seminar in order to maintain decorum at the event."* 

The ESAT test will be conducted for students commencing their university journey in 2024. As your admission is scheduled for the 2025 intake, you will be eligible to sit for the test next year. I trust this clarifies your query. I hope that this helps with your query?
17/2/24, 2:53 PM - +263 78 182 0058: Whats the exam about exactly
22/2/24, 1:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Dean,

I hope you are all doing great. It has been a while since we last connected, and our team has had quite hectic past few days. As you already know, over the past three days, Team Edoofa has been bustling with activity – both in India and Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. Now that things have settled down a bit, I wanted to express my sincere gratitude to you for participating in the event and playing a role in its success.

26/2/24, 12:03 PM - +263 77 305 2518: <Media omitted>

26/2/24, 12:08 PM - +263 77 305 2518: Statement of purpose is taking some time to download.

26/2/24, 12:23 PM - +263 77 305 2518: Okay
26/2/24, 12:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. In such a case, I will look forward to receiving the SOP form from you by today. Once you share the SOP form with us, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. In the meanwhile, let us move on to the third step, which involves Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan.
26/2/24, 12:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
26/2/24, 12:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move ahead with our discussion, may I know if you were able to go through my previous messages about the Meet and Greet Seminar and can share your experience of the same?
26/2/24, 12:56 PM - +263 77 305 2518: Yes ,we did. Yes, the event  was an eye-opener to us.it gave us the right opportunity to feel and admire the existence of Edoofians.
26/2/24, 1:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am so pleased to hear that. Before we start the discussion about the Financial Secure Plan, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
26/2/24, 1:25 PM - +263 77 305 2518: The outstanding balance will be deposited this coming Thursday (29/02/24)
26/2/24, 1:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better. 

In the meantime, Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Medical Lab Technology) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
26/2/24, 1:29 PM - +263 77 305 2518: Yaa that's correct
26/2/24, 1:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
26/2/24, 1:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
26/2/24, 1:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
26/2/24, 1:32 PM - +263 77 305 2518: Yaa, you can go ahead .
26/2/24, 1:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
26/2/24, 1:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
26/2/24, 1:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
26/2/24, 1:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
26/2/24, 1:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
26/2/24, 1:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
27/2/24, 11:52 AM - +263 77 305 2518: We have forwarded the  statement of purpose
27/2/24, 12:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Dean,

I hope you are all doing well today. Thank you for letting me know that please. Could you kindly share a screenshot of the "submitted" page with me?
27/2/24, 12:11 PM - +263 77 305 2518: Unfortunately, we submitted  before taking a screen shot
27/2/24, 12:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Allow me a moment to cross-check our records to confirm your form submission.
27/2/24, 12:12 PM - +263 77 305 2518: Okay
27/2/24, 12:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I was able to check our records and we have successfully received your form response. Regarding our discussion yesterday, may I know if you were able to go through the benefits of the Financial Secure Plan that I had shared with you?
27/2/24, 12:16 PM - +263 77 305 2518: Yes, we managed to go through the same.
27/2/24, 12:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
27/2/24, 12:28 PM - +263 77 305 2518: Yes ,I need to know how.
27/2/24, 12:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in February 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
27/2/24, 12:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
27/2/24, 12:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
27/2/24, 12:47 PM - +263 77 305 2518: Yes l agree
27/2/24, 12:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
27/2/24, 12:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
27/2/24, 12:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
27/2/24, 1:05 PM - +263 77 305 2518: It seems clear.
27/2/24, 1:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
27/2/24, 1:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
27/2/24, 1:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
27/2/24, 1:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
27/2/24, 1:21 PM - +263 77 305 2518: Sure
27/2/24, 1:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to hear. Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
27/2/24, 1:36 PM - +263 77 305 2518: Yes
27/2/24, 1:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay  before your due date.
27/2/24, 1:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
27/2/24, 1:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
27/2/24, 1:58 PM - +263 77 305 2518: Point of correction, we paid $100 first then,$150.
Meaning  the balance is $100
27/2/24, 2:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Kindly excuse me for the confusion from my end. May I know if you were also able to go through the rest of my messages?
27/2/24, 2:09 PM - +263 77 305 2518: Yes
27/2/24, 2:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
27/2/24, 2:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
27/2/24, 2:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
27/2/24, 2:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
27/2/24, 2:35 PM - +263 77 305 2518: It's a good idea.
27/2/24, 3:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
27/2/24, 3:09 PM - +263 77 305 2518: True
27/2/24, 3:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
27/2/24, 3:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
27/2/24, 3:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
27/2/24, 3:35 PM - +263 77 305 2518: It flows well.
27/2/24, 3:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
27/2/24, 3:39 PM - +263 77 305 2518: Understood
27/2/24, 4:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their family the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
1/3/24, 6:49 PM - +263 77 305 2518: Noted with thanks
2/3/24, 3:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Dean,

I hope you are having a pleasant Saturday afternoon. With the team focused on preparations for the Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare, it has been a few days since we have been able to connect on a regular basis. Hence, I am reaching out to schedule our next session on Monday between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM to catch up and ensure we are back on track. Could you please let me know a convenient one-hour time slot within that window for our discussion?
2/3/24, 5:21 PM - +263 78 182 0058: I think from 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM will do
4/3/24, 1:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Dean,

I hope you are having a wonderful day. How are you all doing today?
4/3/24, 1:28 PM - +263 78 182 0058: I'm doing great! ,and u
4/3/24, 1:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held in January, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
4/3/24, 1:40 PM - +263 78 182 0058: Please shed more light
4/3/24, 1:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
4/3/24, 1:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
4/3/24, 1:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
4/3/24, 1:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me share a glimpse of the conference with you and your family. I am certain that you too would be this excited to attend such events when you come to India.

This was indeed a momentous step for all of our students, making them employable ready and giving them access to the right opportunities for their careers ahead.
5/3/24, 1:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Dean,

I hope you are doing well today. I was hoping to get a response from your end yesterday, however, it seems like due to some reason we were unable to connect with each other. May I know if we are still connected or if you are facing any challenges?
5/3/24, 4:27 PM - +263 78 182 0058: Sorry i wasn't able to get back to you,i was in a lesson
5/3/24, 4:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand Dean. In such a case, may I know if 1:30 PM is not a feasible time for you to connect with me?
5/3/24, 4:59 PM - +263 78 182 0058: I think it will be best to schedule our session to 4pm
5/3/24, 5:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In such a case, let us reconnect at *4:00 PM tomorrow* for our session.

I wish you and your family a blessed night!
