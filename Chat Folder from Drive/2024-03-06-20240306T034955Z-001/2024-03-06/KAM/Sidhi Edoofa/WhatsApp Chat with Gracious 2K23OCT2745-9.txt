However, since you are going to be occupied with school and your parents are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
12/1/24, 4:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January].

Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your input and find the right time for our sessions.

Since my operational hours accommodate your timings more suitably, I will be assuming the duties of your admission officer.

27/1/24, 10:58 AM - +263 78 992 7576: Hello Ms Siddhi, I sincerely apologize for not being available at the right time, I was caught up in something 
I'm very sorry 

We can proceed
27/1/24, 10:59 AM - +263 78 992 7576: We are all fine how are you?
27/1/24, 11:27 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are all doing fine. It is completely alright please, I understand that sometimes we get caught up with urgent matters. I am doing fine myself, thank you for asking.
27/1/24, 11:27 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Since this is the first time we are interacting, allow me to introduce myself. I am Miss Siddhi Singh, your Admission Officer. I belong from the vibrant city of Varanasi, known as one of the oldest living cities globally, Beyond my passion for education, I find joy in music and playing basketball. It is my pleasure to assist and guide you through the admission process, ensuring you achieve your dream education in India with the support of Edoofa.
27/1/24, 11:29 AM - +263 78 992 7576: My pleasure

27/1/24, 11:53 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The pleasure is mine, Gracious. I am glad to know that we also have similarities. I was going through your application profile and it is my understanding that you were being introduced to Edoofa's Financial Secure Plan. May I know if I am correct?
27/1/24, 12:01 PM - +263 78 992 7576: Yes that's correct
27/1/24, 12:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. Could you kindly share your queries or thoughts about the same, if you have any?
27/1/24, 12:43 PM - +263 78 992 7576: I understand that my father would prefer to open a personal account for me to save money for my education, rather than using an account through Edoofa. I respect his decision and want to make sure we're following the best financial practices for my education
I don't know how does that sounds to you
27/1/24, 1:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Thank you for letting me know that. The Financial Secure Plan is not mandatory for the students, and if you wish to save the money in your own bank account that is perfectly reasonable. However, since we are carefully planning and personalising every student's finances, we will require your help and cooperation to do so. The end goal is to ensure that you are successfully able to save up $1500 in the next 10 months so that you are not subjected to any difficulties when you come to India next year in 2025. In order to do that, you can deposit your money in your bank account and share the receipt with us every month so that we are also able to keep a track of your savings and help you plan for the future accordingly. I hope we are together in this?
27/1/24, 2:29 PM - +263 78 992 7576: Yes sure
27/1/24, 2:31 PM - +263 78 992 7576: Im not sure if we will be able to save the 1500 in the next ten months because I have to pay my exam registration fee before starting the fanancing plan 
But we are surely going to be  depositing money every month
27/1/24, 2:32 PM - +263 78 992 7576: My dad, will tell you his view, right now I think he's busy at work but he surely will talk to you after he's done
27/1/24, 3:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. I understand that you have school during the weekdays and your parents are occupied with work. In such a case, I want to ensure that our sessions are held in a timely and smooth manner so we can comfortably proceed with your application process and discuss the financial plan. Could you kindly suggest a 1-hour slot between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM when we can have our sessions?
27/1/24, 4:14 PM - +263 78 992 7576: 4pm to 5pm is the right time
27/1/24, 4:14 PM - +263 78 992 7576: I will be done with school and I'm sure my parents won't be occupied too much
29/1/24, 4:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Gracious. I hope you are all doing well today. How has your day been going so far?
29/1/24, 4:28 PM - +263 78 992 7576: Good afternoon Ms Siddhi , my day has been okay, just dealing with Monday blues

29/1/24, 5:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. I am glad that your day has been going okay. I am doing fine too, thank you for asking. Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held last week, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
29/1/24, 6:52 PM - +263 78 992 7576: No i ain't ma'am
29/1/24, 6:54 PM - +263 78 992 7576: Well I'm now also curious to know what SLICE CON is

30/1/24, 5:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
30/1/24, 5:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me share a glimpse of the conference with you and your family. I am certain that Gracious too would be this excited to attend such events when he comes to India.

I hope you are having a wonderful day. How are you all doing today?
31/1/24, 4:26 PM - +263 78 992 7576: We are doing well ma'am how are you?
31/1/24, 5:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am fine too, thank you for asking. Regarding the discussion we had the other day about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
31/1/24, 6:16 PM - +263 78 992 7576: Yes we wanted to ask that since i still have a lot of time here,cant we deposit 100 dollars per month since  it's supposed to be 150 dollars or i should strictly pay the $150 dollars for those ten months
1/2/24, 9:00 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Gracious. I hope you are all doing wonderful today.

I was unable to respond to your last message as our operational hours had concluded by then. However, I am glad that we can reconnect today and move forward with our discussion.
1/2/24, 9:09 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: We have carefully curated this payment plan, keeping in mind the time and money constraints. I agree that we do have time in our hand, however, the planning has been done by considering all factors, including time, money and flexibility. If you happen to deposit smaller amounts, we might not be able to achieve the amount of savings that we are aiming for by the time Gracious will receive her offer letter. In order to ensure that, we will have to work together and be consistent with the plan. I hope we are together in this?
1/2/24, 10:32 AM - +263 78 992 7576: Good morning Ms Siddhi, we are all well thank you
1/2/24, 10:32 AM - +263 78 992 7576: Okay ma'am, we understand
1/2/24, 11:26 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for understanding, Parents and Gracious. For the current round of students, there are only 27 seats available for the students who can benefit from the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. 

Since you have been one of the most dedicated students, and I see you have great aspirations, I wanted you to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way. <This message was edited>
1/2/24, 11:26 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of February, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
1/2/24, 11:26 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
1/2/24, 12:43 PM - +263 78 992 7576: Thank you Ms Siddhi, I really appreciate
1/2/24, 12:44 PM - +263 78 992 7576: Well we  will need to discuss this with my parents so that we come up with a specified date
1/2/24, 2:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know Gracious. In such a case, let us conclude our discussion for today and we will reconnect tomorrow. I hope that by tomorrow you will be able to discuss the plan in detail with your family. I wish you a blessed day ahead!

6/2/24, 4:58 PM - +263 78 992 7576: We are yet to discuss a specific date
6/2/24, 5:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In such a case, may I suggest choosing the 30th of every month if you are comfortable with paying at the end of every month?
6/2/24, 5:36 PM - +263 77 463 0352: Good afternoon Madam, l would suggest making payments in the middle of every month since we have a few bills to pay every end of month.

This event holds a special place in our hearts as it brings us closer to our community, and we're counting down the days with great anticipation!
6/2/24, 8:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Just like clockwork, we're gearing up for the seminar next week, and I couldn't resist sharing our enthusiasm with you. Your presence would truly make the event all the more meaningful, guiding you on your journey to India. Hence, with immense joy, we wanted to extend the special invitation for the Meet and Greet Seminar to you and your wonderful family.
6/2/24, 8:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: And in the process of doing the same, I happened to notice that you haven't started your EWYL Program by now.

Hence, we can start the plan from the month of March till December. You also mentioned that you preferred the monthly deposit date to be in the middle of the month, so I suggest the date of 15th. May I know if that will be suitable for you?

16/2/24, 9:52 PM - +263 77 463 1307: Duly noted
16/2/24, 9:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Since the admit cards have been automatically generated through a software, due to some technical error it has mentioned "Do not communicate with fellow candidates during examination" instead of *"Kindly do not communicate with fellow students during the seminar in order to maintain decorum at the event."* 

The ESAT test will be conducted for students commencing their university journey in 2024. As your admission is scheduled for the 2025 intake, you will be eligible to sit for the test next year. I trust this clarifies your query. I hope that this helps with your query?

26/2/24, 6:30 PM - +263 78 992 7576: Hello Miss Siddhi, we are all well thank you
26/2/24, 6:30 PM - +263 78 992 7576: Sorry for late response, I think were all swamped with our work
27/2/24, 12:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Gracious,

I hope you are doing well today. Kindly excuse me for not being able to respond to your last message as I was not feeling well and had to conclude my day early. However, I am pleased to let you know that I am feeling better today and eager to proceed with our discussion. Before we do so, I would like to ask how your day has been going so far?
27/2/24, 5:35 PM - +263 77 463 0352: Good afternoon Madam, we are all good  thank you. Apologies for late response l was also busy at work just finished now.
27/2/24, 5:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. My operational hours have concluded already. However, since we have not been able to connect with each other consistently in the last 2 weeks and you had shared certain concerns related to your monthly installments, I believe we can have a brief conversation right now. <This message was edited>
27/2/24, 5:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You mentioned that due to examination registration fees due in the month of March, you will be unable to proceed with the plan from March onwards, and wish to begin in April instead. Could you kindly confirm that?
27/2/24, 5:53 PM - +263 78 992 7576: Hello Miss Siddhi, we are all well and I'm glad you are now feeling better
27/2/24, 5:53 PM - +263 78 992 7576: Yes that's correct
27/2/24, 5:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your concern, please. I appreciate it.

The plan has been provided to you to ensure that we are able to consistently save in small amounts towards your higher education funds. As you might be aware, we will be processing your profile under early applications for the 2025 intake. In such a case, the registration fees due towards securing the scholarship seat will be due in the month of August. We want to ensure that you do not face any last minute burdens due to the finances.
27/2/24, 6:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Since you confirmed that you will be able to begin the plan from the month of April instead of March, would it be feasible for you to adjust your first installment amount in the subsequent months? Let me elaborate. You have two options: you can either make installments of $167 from April to December. Alternatively, you can begin with the regular $150 installments from April and choose a month to adjust the initial $150 installment. Could you kindly let me know which option works best for you?
27/2/24, 6:08 PM - +263 78 992 7576: Ma'am, we will have to talk this through with my  father and at the moment I think he's busy at work.
27/2/24, 6:15 PM - +263 77 463 0352: Hellow Madam, the option of making installments of  $150 per month will be best for me and then adust in one month. Thank you.
27/2/24, 6:19 PM - +263 78 992 7576: I got reach reach of him, he will be replying soon
28/2/24, 3:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Gracious,

I hope you are having a lovely day. Thank you for informing me of your preference to begin your monthly installments of $150 from April onwards and to adjust the remaining $150 from March in the last month of the plan, which is December. 

Since you have been one of the most dedicated students, and I see you have great aspirations, I wanted you to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.
28/2/24, 3:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
28/2/24, 3:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
28/2/24, 6:55 PM - +263 78 992 7576: Good evening Ms Siddhi 

I hope you're doing well I want to update you on my situation at the moment
As you know, I used to get in touch I with you during the day but unfortunately smartphones are no longer allowed at my school, which explains why I haven't been able to make our scheduled sessions on time.
 I also commute home after school, which means I don't arrive home until after 5pm. 
As a result of this I  would like to request some flexibility in our schedule. Perhaps we could try to schedule our sessions for the weekend, or after 5:30pm when I'm home from school and able to access my phone
I really value our sessions and would appreciate any flexibility you can offer
28/2/24, 6:55 PM - +263 78 992 7576: Thank you ma'am, I really appreciate
28/2/24, 6:55 PM - +263 78 992 7576: The date is still going to be the 15th of every month
29/2/24, 8:08 AM - +263 78 992 7576: Good morning ma'am
Today I missed school, I'm not feeling well but we can have time to discuss
29/2/24, 10:27 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Gracious,

How are you
4/3/24, 8:08 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Gracious,

I hope you are having a lovely morning. I was unable to respond to your message yesterday as Sunday is not an operational day for us. However, I am glad to let you know that we can now proceed with our discussion. May I know if you and your parents were able to go through the Financial Secure Plan agreement that I had shared with you?
4/3/24, 10:11 AM - +263 77 463 0352: Good morning Madam, we are all good thank you.
4/3/24, 10:18 AM - +263 77 463 0352: I went through the financial secure plan agreement, during the month of December, we usually face a rise in expenses due to Holiday and other activities that occure during this month. A payment of $300 will be a bit tough for me during this month.
4/3/24, 10:19 AM - +263 77 463 0352: I would suggest we add the other $150 in any mid  year month like September or October so things can be a bit flexible for me.
4/3/24, 11:04 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Surely, that is possible. In such a case, you have the option to select a month during which you will be able to adjust the amount. May I know if you have been able to discuss the same with your family and decide on a particular month?
4/3/24, 11:05 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I would like to highlight that the deadlines are set to designate a final payment date. You have the flexibility to make the payment anytime between the previous and the upcoming deadline. <This message was edited>
4/3/24, 11:05 AM - +263 77 463 0352: Yes sure, as stated above, you can put the $150 either in September or October.
4/3/24, 11:06 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you have a surplus budget exceeding $150 in any given month, you have the option to deposit that amount, which will then be adjusted with your subsequent deposits. For instance, if you deposit $200 in March, your next payment due in April will be adjusted to $100.
Kindly take the same into consideration and let me know which month you would prefer for the payment.
4/3/24, 11:06 AM - +263 77 463 0352: Gracious is currently not avaialable, at school, she will be back after 5pm.
4/3/24, 11:06 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Could you kindly confirm whether you wish to adjust it in September or October please?
4/3/24, 11:07 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: To be on the safe side, you can choose a later month for the same so that you do not miss the deadline and are able to complete the payment whenever it is feasible for you before the deadline. <This message was edited>
4/3/24, 11:07 AM - +263 77 463 0352: Duly noted with pleasure, then this will make our lives easier.
4/3/24, 11:08 AM - +263 77 463 0352: Yes thank you, l will print, sign and send the forms back to you soon.
4/3/24, 11:09 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. In such a case, may I know if you wish to proceed with the same plan and are okay with having the deadline for the $150 adjustment in the month of December?
4/3/24, 11:22 AM - +263 77 463 0352: Yes its fine let us leave it as it is, l will try to spread  it over the months so that when we reach the month of December, it will be fully paid.
4/3/24, 11:23 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that please. I urge you to kindly share the information with me when you are planning on making the adjusted payments such that I am able to update our records and share the relevant information with the accounts team as well. I hope we are together in this?
4/3/24, 11:33 AM - +263 77 463 0352: Yes, since it is something that will happen according to the available finances at a given time, l will be able to share the information if any adjustment has been made, meaning if l pay anything above $150 at a given month, l will advise you.
4/3/24, 11:37 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that and your cooperation is appreciated. In such a case, could you kindly let me know by when you will be able to share the signed document with me?
4/3/24, 12:14 PM - +263 77 463 0352: I will be able to Share the signed document tomorrow, Tusday 05 March. Thank you.
