29/12/23, 4:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Kevin,

I hope this message finds you well and in good spirits as we welcome the New Year. I'd like to take a moment to extend my best wishes to you and your family for a prosperous and rewarding 2024. May it be a year filled with new beginnings, opportunities, and the fulfillment of all your dreams and goals.
29/12/23, 4:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As I was organizing my day today. In reviewing your scholarship application file, I noticed that there's an outstanding payment of $150 for your Edoofa Enrollment fee due by 2nd December 2023. Hence I thought of sharing a gentle reminder about this and checking in to see if you have already made this payment. This will help us to keep your scholarship application file up-to-date and ensure that all is progressing smoothly.
29/12/23, 5:53 PM - +263 77 404 5614: Good day how are you? This is Sheila,  Kevin's mom. May you please allow us to pay this balance on the 5th of January 2024.
29/12/23, 7:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. May I know what challenges were you facing due to which you were unable to clear the remaining balance on time?
29/12/23, 7:05 PM - +263 77 404 5614: My mother was involved in an accident and was hospitalised since mid November. She is getting better now so l couldn't afford to pay the balance that time. I am sorry that l didn't inform you. The pressure was just too much for me l am so sorry
29/12/23, 7:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263774045614I'm truly sorry to hear about your mother's accident and her hospitalization since mid-November. It's completely understandable that under such circumstances, managing financial commitments, including the payment balance, could be challenging. May I know what happened?
29/12/23, 7:56 PM - +263 77 404 5614: She is a mental patient so she left home without informing anyone... We never heard from her the whole day...only to find out that she was admitted at Annex Hospital the following day from  a nurse who had posted looking for her relatives
29/12/23, 8:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I'm deeply sorry to hear about the challenging situation with your mother. It must have been incredibly distressing not to hear from her for an entire day, especially given her mental health condition. Discovering that she was admitted to Annex Hospital in such circumstances must have brought a mix of relief and concern.

It's a difficult experience for any family to go through, and it's important during these times to have support and understanding from those around you. I hope that now that she's been located and is under care, things are a bit more manageable for you and your family?
29/12/23, 8:36 PM - +263 77 404 5614: Yes she much better now despite the fact that two of her ribs got broken when she was hit by the car. She is recovering at home now.
29/12/23, 8:36 PM - +263 77 404 5614: *From home*
29/12/23, 10:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that she is getting better now, I can understand how hard it must be for you to watch your mother go through all of this. I am sure she will recover soon. I want to extend my wishes to you and your family. As we stand on the threshold of a new year, I extend my heartfelt wishes to you and your family for a prosperous and fulfilling 2024. May this year bring new opportunities, fresh beginnings, and the realization of your dreams and aspirations.

I hope the coming year is filled with success, health, and happiness for you and your loved ones. May it be a year that surpasses all expectations and is replete with moments of joy and achievement.

Wishing you a Happy New Year⭐

2/1/24, 9:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I was expecting to hear back from you, but as there hasn't been a response and given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.

26/1/24, 9:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Kevin,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa*. Recently I was having a discussion with the Academic Board. They highlighted  that you have not been able to proceed with your admission process in a timely manner, since your child is at school and you have been occupied with work. Hence, I pitched in that I will be able to help you out and take over your application profile so that together we can ensure a timely and smooth progress. Since my operational hours accommodate your timings more suitably, I will be assuming the duties of your admission officer. I am optimistic that together, we can pave the way for an auspicious beginning to your academic journey, resulting in the right career prospects and eventual success for both you and your family.
26/1/24, 9:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

27/1/24, 12:12 PM - +263 78 664 5909: Thank you,  I will communicate with you tomorrow.
27/1/24, 1:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kevin. I hope you are having a lovely day. How are you all doing today?
27/1/24, 7:00 PM - +263 78 082 7631: I'm doing okay
27/1/24, 7:00 PM - +263 78 082 7631: How are you ?
29/1/24, 9:37 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kevin. I am doing well too, thank you for asking. I was unable to respond to your message on Saturday as our operational hours had concluded, however I am glad to know that we can connect today.
29/1/24, 9:37 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Since this is the first time we are interacting, allow me to introduce myself. I am Miss Siddhi Singh, your Admission Officer.

29/1/24, 11:53 AM - +263 78 664 5909: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 11:54 AM - +263 78 664 5909: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 4:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same. I have taken a note of it. I understand that Kevin has school during the weekdays and you are occupied with work. In such a case, I want to ensure that our sessions are held in a timely and smooth manner so we can comfortably proceed with your application process. Could you kindly suggest a 1-hour slot between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM when we can have our sessions?
30/1/24, 4:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kevin.

I hope everything is well on your end. I was hoping to get a response form your end yesterday, but it seems like due to some reason we were unable to connect. However, I am glad that we can reconnect today. Before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to check in on you and your family. How are you all doing today?
30/1/24, 4:38 PM - +263 78 664 5909: Iam doing Fine Ms. Siddhi, our problem here is that if you see us failing to communicate with you it normarly will be caused by some poor network to some of our network providers. Therefore Kevin only uses Data bundles and at times he might be on the WiFi if possible. As we speak right now iam using my office internet which it difficult for Kevin To access during the day as we will be a distance apart. I will try by all means to let him access good network coverage after day.
30/1/24, 4:46 PM - +263 78 664 5909: Thank you for your concern.
30/1/24, 5:38 PM - +263 78 082 7631: Yes from 16:00PM to 17:00 PM
30/1/24, 5:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Thank you for letting me know of the same. However, since my operational hours for the day have concluded and I have already had a long day, let us reconnect tomorrow to further discuss the process ahead. I hope that we will be able to connect and make timely progress in Kevin's application. I hope you have a blessed day ahead and kindly extend my regards to your family as well.
31/1/24, 4:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kevin.

I hope you are having a wonderful day. How are you all doing today?
31/1/24, 4:41 PM - +263 78 664 5909: Iam doing fine thank you.
31/1/24, 4:59 PM - +263 78 082 7631: I'm doing okay
31/1/24, 5:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I was going through Kevin's application profile and it is my understanding that you had successfully completed the 2nd step of the admission cycle i.e., Statement of Purpose. May I know if I am correct? <This message was edited>
31/1/24, 6:05 PM - +263 78 082 7631: Yes correct
31/1/24, 7:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Ryan Munashe Muguta and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
31/1/24, 7:23 PM - +263 78 082 7631: What do you mean Ryan Munashe Muguta
31/1/24, 10:45 PM - +263 78 664 5909: I am sorry I think it's a mix up, my Son is called Kevin Tanaka Mapfumo. Confirm again ma'am on the above findings
1/2/24, 10:44 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kevin. I hope you are all doing great today!

Kindly excuse me for the confusion caused, as I was actively conversing with a lot of students at once. To correct myself, the course you have selected for your higher education is *Bachelors in Computer Application* and you are planning to arrive in India during August 2025. May I know if this information is accurate?
1/2/24, 3:55 PM - +263 78 082 7631: Yes that's correct
2/2/24, 4:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kevin.

I hope you are having a wonderful day. Kindly excuse me for not being able to respond to your message last night as our team is currently working tirelessly towards the preparation of our upcoming Zimbabwe trip in the month of February. During our previous interaction you confirmed your course and year of intake. Allow me to proceed with our discussion.
2/2/24, 4:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
2/2/24, 4:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
2/2/24, 4:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
2/2/24, 5:21 PM - +263 78 082 7631: In the counselling sessions I've never been told about a financial secure plan
2/2/24, 5:21 PM - +263 78 082 7631: What plan are you talking about
2/2/24, 5:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. The Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an exclusive payment plan we have introduced for the students of 2025 intake. We have carefully curated the plan considering multiple factors like consistency, flexibility and transparency. Allow me to help you understand it better.
2/2/24, 5:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
2/2/24, 5:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
2/2/24, 5:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
2/2/24, 5:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
2/2/24, 5:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
2/2/24, 5:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
2/2/24, 6:09 PM - +263 78 082 7631: What if my parents can't afford the plan
3/2/24, 12:20 AM - +263 78 664 5909: As you have said Kevin, myself and your mother will have to go through. And we will appreciate Kevin's decision as parents . He is doing well at High School and as a parent I will support him
3/2/24, 11:45 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kevin.

I hope you are having a lovely morning.
3/2/24, 11:47 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand your concern Kevin. However, the amount that you will be depositing every month will be counted towards your first year of education. It is not an extra cost that you are bearing, instead, you are getting an option to begin your college savings from now onwards, so that you do not face an issue in the future when it is time to make the payment for the registration fee. I hope you are following Kevin?
3/2/24, 11:48 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you sir for showing your support and understanding. I am happy to hear that you are among the parents who have a long-term vision and plan one-step ahead to ensure that the planning for your child's future is on the right path.
3/2/24, 12:21 PM - +263 77 404 5614: This message was deleted

Therefore, we will be unavailable during this time on Friday and Saturday. Let us conclude our discussion here for today, and we will resume our sessions on Monday.

Until then, I wish you a blessed week ahead. Kindly convey my regards to your family as well. <This message was edited>

However, I understand that we were not able to have our discussions on a regular basis due to the team being occupied with the preparations of the Meet and Greet Seminar at Harare. Hence, I believe we can have a brief conversation right now to proceed with our discussions. May I know if you were able to go through my previous messages about the seminar and can share your experience of the same?

I enjoyed the Meet and Greet 
They also gave us chances to ask about the programme and everything we had doubts on 
They cleared all our doubts and explained very well
