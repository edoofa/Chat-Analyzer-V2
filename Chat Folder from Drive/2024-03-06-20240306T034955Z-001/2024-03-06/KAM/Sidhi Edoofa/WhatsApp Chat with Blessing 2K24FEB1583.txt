4/3/24, 10:49 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Welcome @26772178074 to your admission group. Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
4/3/24, 10:53 AM - +267 72 178 074: Greetings maam
4/3/24, 10:53 AM - +267 72 178 074: Yes we can start
4/3/24, 10:54 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
4/3/24, 10:59 AM - +267 72 178 074: I have read
4/3/24, 11:00 AM - +267 72 178 074: the admission cycle
4/3/24, 11:17 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
4/3/24, 11:17 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
4/3/24, 11:20 AM - +267 72 178 074: Understood
4/3/24, 11:24 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counselling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counselling session will take about 1 hour.
4/3/24, 11:24 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
4/3/24, 11:30 AM - +267 72 178 074: Yes, I am following
4/3/24, 11:35 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
4/3/24, 11:35 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
4/3/24, 11:51 AM - +267 72 178 074: Yes
4/3/24, 11:54 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
4/3/24, 11:56 AM - +267 72 178 074: Yes
4/3/24, 11:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
4/3/24, 11:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding during tomorrow’s session. You may take today’s time for the same. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
4/3/24, 11:59 AM - +267 72 178 074: Yea

4/3/24, 12:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. You may take today's time to thoroughly go through the videos and we will reconnect tomorrow. I would also like to reiterate that our operational hours are from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Central African Time.
4/3/24, 12:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Considering this, for our future sessions, you have to decide on an hour’s time that suits your availability within this timeframe and share the same with us so that we can tailor our subsequent sessions to accommodate your schedule effectively.
4/3/24, 12:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For the next couple of days, we will have sessions on a daily basis and once we cover the first three steps of the admission cycle, we will have sessions scheduled on a need basis. Hence, can you let me know at what time you would like us to schedule our sessions on a daily basis (between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM)?
4/3/24, 12:31 PM - +267 72 178 074: At 1200hrs
4/3/24, 12:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. In such a case, we will schedule tomorrow’s session at this time. 

This timeline is essential to ensure a smooth progression in the admission process and to meet the goal of concluding this session before Thursday, enabling us to assist you in initiating your EWYL process on time. I hope we are together with this?
4/3/24, 2:23 PM - +267 72 178 074: We are
4/3/24, 2:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 12:00 PM for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to go through the videos. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed rest of the day and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.

5/3/24, 12:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. During our previous session, I had shared 4 videos containing messages from the founder's office. May I know if you were able to go through all of them and understand the intended message?
5/3/24, 12:06 PM - +267 72 178 074: I was able to watch the videos multiple times and I understood each of them
5/3/24, 12:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. To discuss the videos and the importance of the message shared by the founders, could you kindly share your understanding of each video with me?
5/3/24, 12:35 PM - +267 72 178 074: On video 1 I understood that the eddoga program has been helpful to students over a long period, and as an edoofa student you should be open minded and be able to follow instructions.

5/3/24, 12:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
5/3/24, 12:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
5/3/24, 12:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?

5/3/24, 1:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow before our session.
