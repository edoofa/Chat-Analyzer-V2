Moving forward, as a part of your application file, you will need to visit your school and secure a letter of recommendation from them. We have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process.
2/3/24, 2:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/3/24, 2:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, *your subject combination for A Level exams*, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

2/3/24, 2:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to inquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?

2/3/24, 2:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Considering this, for our future sessions, you have to decide on an hour’s time that suits your availability within this timeframe and share the same with us so that we can tailor our subsequent sessions to accommodate your schedule effectively.
2/3/24, 2:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For the next couple of days, we will have sessions on a daily basis and once we cover the first three steps of the admission cycle, we will have sessions scheduled on a need basis. Hence, can you let me know at what time you would like us to schedule our sessions on a daily basis (between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM)?
2/3/24, 2:55 PM - +263 71 358 2853: To me the set time is fine
2/3/24, 2:55 PM - +263 71 358 2853: 1 O'clock in the afternoon is good <This message was edited>

I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
4/3/24, 1:24 PM - +263 71 358 2853: Here is the recommendation letter from my former school
4/3/24, 1:24 PM - +263 71 358 2853: <Media omitted>

4/3/24, 4:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
4/3/24, 4:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
4/3/24, 4:13 PM - +263 71 296 9155: Good afternoon  l  am ok sorry  to respond  late  l was busy
4/3/24, 4:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. May I know if you have been able to go through the previous messages?
4/3/24, 8:25 PM - +263 71 358 2853: Yes,well noted
5/3/24, 9:47 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Bornwell,

I hope you are doing well today. We were unable to move forward with our discussion yesterday. However, I am pleased that we can reconnect today. Before we begin, I would like to inquire how has your day been going so far?
5/3/24, 9:52 AM - +263 71 358 2853: Good morning ..everything is going well so far
5/3/24, 9:54 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. During our session yesterday, we had discussed the first 2 steps in the admission cycle. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counselling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counselling session will take about 1 hour.
5/3/24, 9:54 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
5/3/24, 10:00 AM - +263 71 358 2853: Duly noted
5/3/24, 10:06 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
5/3/24, 10:06 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
5/3/24, 10:12 AM - +263 71 358 2853: Yes it is clear ma'am
5/3/24, 10:13 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
5/3/24, 10:16 AM - +263 71 358 2853: Yes please
5/3/24, 10:26 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
5/3/24, 10:26 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding during tomorrow’s session. You may take today’s time for the same. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled for tomorrow after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarise your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly for tomorrow?

I hope by then you will be able to complete the tasks. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed night and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
