6/2/24, 12:21 PM - +263 77 540 5274: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 12:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tapiwa.

I hope that you are all doing wonderful today. Thank you for sharing the updated EWYL form with me Tapiwa. How has your day been going so far?
6/2/24, 12:52 PM - +263 77 540 5274: Afternoon ma'am my day was good
6/2/24, 2:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you day has been going good. Since you were able to go through the image that I shared with you yesterday, allow me to explain the steps to you.
6/2/24, 2:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
6/2/24, 2:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
6/2/24, 3:20 PM - +263 77 540 5274: Yes they are clear
6/2/24, 4:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps - 

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
6/2/24, 4:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
6/2/24, 4:04 PM - +263 77 540 5274: Yes l am following
6/2/24, 4:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
6/2/24, 4:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
6/2/24, 4:18 PM - +263 77 540 5274: Okay
6/2/24, 4:21 PM - +263 77 540 5274: Does the fee have a deadline for payment
6/2/24, 4:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes. Most of the universities have a deadline of 15 days after they have issued the offer letter to the students.
6/2/24, 4:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
6/2/24, 4:42 PM - +263 77 540 5274: Yes ma'am
6/2/24, 4:43 PM - +263 77 540 5274: I have understood
6/2/24, 5:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
6/2/24, 5:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
6/2/24, 5:10 PM - +263 77 540 5274: You may share the videos
6/2/24, 5:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled for tomorrow after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?

9/2/24, 4:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that, Tapiwa. Kindly excuse me for the delay in my response.
9/2/24, 4:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
9/2/24, 4:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of tomorrow.
9/2/24, 4:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
9/2/24, 4:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
9/2/24, 4:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose. I hope you were able to follow through with this?

9/2/24, 4:42 PM - +263 77 540 5274: Yes l am clear with this

Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow before our session.
9/2/24, 5:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

9/2/24, 5:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
9/2/24, 5:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
9/2/24, 5:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
9/2/24, 5:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Along with these tasks, I want you to share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result or Letter of Recommendation or Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
9/2/24, 5:21 PM - +263 77 540 5274: Ma'am l  do not have the A-level results because l am writing this year
9/2/24, 6:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand Tapiwa. In such a case, as a part of your application file, you will need to visit your school and secure a letter of recommendation from them. We have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process.
9/2/24, 6:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
9/2/24, 6:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, *your subject combination for A Level exams*, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
9/2/24, 6:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application.

Hence I would like to inquire by when will you be able to share the documents with us?
9/2/24, 6:32 PM - +263 77 540 5274: I will be able to share the documents on Tuesday
9/2/24, 7:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. Also, as promised, now that you are a part of the Edoofa Journey, the opportunity to help you self-fund your higher education and for you to be industry-ready s here, and in light of the same, I would like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Friday (9 February 2024).
9/2/24, 7:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Friday, as previously agreed upon.

To kick start the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

10/2/24, 3:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am so pleased to hear that you are all good. I am doing well, thank you for asking. During our previous session, I had shared 2 tasks related to your SOP. May I know if you were able to complete both of them?
10/2/24, 6:29 PM - +263 77 540 5274: Not yet
10/2/24, 6:38 PM - +263 77 540 5274: <Media omitted>

12/2/24, 8:06 AM - +263 77 540 5274: <Media omitted>
12/2/24, 8:10 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tapiwa.

I hope you had a wonderful weekend. How are things on your end today?
12/2/24, 8:22 AM - +263 77 540 5274: Morning ma'am
12/2/24, 8:48 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response to the tasks and your O-Level results, Tapiwa. I am currently waiting for the other documents as well, in the meanwhile, let us proceed with our discussion. 
With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey, i.e. *Introduction to Financial Secure Plan*.
12/2/24, 8:48 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA (Travel and Tourism) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
12/2/24, 10:42 AM - +263 77 540 5274: <Media omitted>
12/2/24, 11:00 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the letter of recommendation with me Tapiwa. However, you are required to mention your A-Level subject combination in the LOR, since it is an important aspect to proceed with your application. Could you kindly make the changes and share the LOR with me?
12/2/24, 11:02 AM - +263 77 540 5274: It is difficult to make changes
12/2/24, 11:12 AM - +263 77 540 5274: If possible l can write my subject combination  on the gaps
12/2/24, 11:30 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: You can write your subject combination on the gaps. However, in such a case, could you kindly also share your term results for your form 5 exams so that we can cross-check your A-Level subject combination?
12/2/24, 11:41 AM - +263 77 540 5274: Okay, l do not have my report book but l can share the results before today's evening
12/2/24, 12:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is alright please. Kindly share the same when it is available with you. In the meanwhile, let us proceed with our discussion. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey, i.e. *Introduction to Financial Secure Plan*.
12/2/24, 12:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA (Travel and Tourism) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
12/2/24, 1:06 PM - +263 77 540 5274: Yes it is correct
12/2/24, 1:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
12/2/24, 1:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
12/2/24, 1:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
12/2/24, 1:48 PM - +263 77 540 5274: Can you please elaborate a little
12/2/24, 2:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
12/2/24, 2:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
12/2/24, 2:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
12/2/24, 2:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
12/2/24, 2:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
12/2/24, 2:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
12/2/24, 3:28 PM - +263 77 540 5274: Thank you for the explanation  l really appreciate it
12/2/24, 3:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
12/2/24, 3:43 PM - +263 77 540 5274: No need
12/2/24, 3:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand that you were able to grasp the concept of the Financial Secure Plan. However, it is important that you are also able to understand how exactly the plan will work out in the upcoming months and what will happen as we proceed. If we are together here, shall I proceed with our discussion? <This message was edited>
12/2/24, 4:06 PM - +263 77 540 5274: You may proceed
12/2/24, 4:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in February 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
12/2/24, 4:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
12/2/24, 4:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
12/2/24, 4:12 PM - +263 77 540 5274: Yes l agree
12/2/24, 4:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
12/2/24, 4:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
12/2/24, 4:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
12/2/24, 4:22 PM - +263 77 540 5274: I understand
12/2/24, 4:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
12/2/24, 4:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
12/2/24, 4:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
12/2/24, 4:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
12/2/24, 4:58 PM - +263 77 540 5274: Yes you are correct
12/2/24, 5:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to hear. Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
12/2/24, 5:19 PM - +263 77 540 5274: Yes sure
12/2/24, 5:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500.
12/2/24, 5:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off $150 from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
12/2/24, 5:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
12/2/24, 5:54 PM - +263 77 540 5274: Yes
12/2/24, 6:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
12/2/24, 6:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
12/2/24, 6:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
12/2/24, 6:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
12/2/24, 6:09 PM - +263 77 540 5274: Is the registration fee compulsory to pay
12/2/24, 6:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The registration fee is part of your first year of university fees, and it is compulsory to pay in order to secure your scholarship. It is not an additional cost as it will be inclusive of your cost of education for the first year. I hope we are together on this?
12/2/24, 6:23 PM - +263 77 540 5274: Yes l am clear
13/2/24, 7:20 AM - +263 77 540 5274: <Media omitted>
13/2/24, 7:20 AM - +263 77 540 5274: <Media omitted>
13/2/24, 9:26 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tapiwa,

I hope you are doing great. Thank you for sharing the updated LOR and your ID Proof, I have taken a note of it and will add it to your application profile. How are things with you this fine morning?
13/2/24, 9:28 AM - +263 77 540 5274: Good morning ma'am everything is fine here
13/2/24, 10:21 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. During our previous discussion we were discussing how the Financial Secure Plan helps in easing the financial burden on students and their parents. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
13/2/24, 10:39 AM - +263 77 540 5274: Yes you are correct
13/2/24, 10:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
13/2/24, 10:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
13/2/24, 10:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
13/2/24, 11:03 AM - +263 77 540 5274: I understand
13/2/24, 11:21 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
13/2/24, 12:15 PM - +263 77 540 5274: I wull inform my dad  and let you know about it however l have understood the financial secure plan well
13/2/24, 1:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their family the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
13/2/24, 2:07 PM - +263 77 540 5274: I usually talk with my parents on  weekends
14/2/24, 8:40 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Greetings, Parents and Tapiwa!

26/2/24, 1:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know if you were able to go through my previous message and can let me know if you have any queries or concerns regarding the Financial Secure Plan?
26/2/24, 1:38 PM - +263 77 540 5274: I have gone through the Financial   Secure plan and l have understood about it and l have also talked with my dad. There are a few challenges that my dad is facing and if possible we can start to pay the fee in the Month of May and to pay $100   or $50.
26/2/24, 1:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In order to help the academic board understand your situation better, could you kindly share with me if you have any particular reason due to which you will not be able to proceed with the plan from this or next month onwards?
26/2/24, 1:45 PM - +263 77 540 5274: My dad has to pay for my younger sister's school fees and l have to pay my November examination fee which is on the month of March
26/2/24, 2:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In such a case, may I know if you will be able to cover up from May onwards for missing your first 3 monthly deposits?
26/2/24, 2:05 PM - +263 77 540 5274: Yes l will be able to cover up from May but if possible can l pay $100
26/2/24, 2:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you wish to cover up for the first 3 months from May onwards, the calculation for your monthly deposits stands at $215. I understand that you wish to make $100 deposits. However, your profile will be processed under early applications to ensure that you are able to secure your scholarship seat at the best university. In such a case, we will not be able to save enough in a timely manner for the payment of your registration amount in the month of August. May I know if you have considered this?
26/2/24, 2:10 PM - +263 77 540 5274: I have considered this
26/2/24, 2:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. In such a case, may I know how you wish to proceed with the plan?

27/2/24, 11:48 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tapiwa,

I hope you are doing well today. Thank you for letting me know that you wish to proceed with the Financial Secure Plan. As your admission officer, I want to ensure that you are fully prepared for your higher education journey. In such a case, could you kindly confirm the plan you have in mind such that we are able to save $1500 towards your higher education funds by November? <This message was edited>
27/2/24, 5:07 PM - +263 77 540 5274: Good afternoon ma'am
27/2/24, 5:09 PM - +263 77 540 5274: I will be able to save $1500 by November as there will be no more challenges
28/2/24, 11:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, Parents and Tapiwa. For the current round of students, there are only 5 seats available for the students who can benefit from the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. 

Since you have been one of the most dedicated students, and I see you have great aspirations, I wanted you to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.
28/2/24, 11:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of February, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
28/2/24, 11:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
28/2/24, 11:25 AM - +263 77 540 5274: I will talk with my dad about the dates as he is   the one who will be paying
28/2/24, 12:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Surely. Could you kindly let me know by when you will be able to discuss about the date with him?
28/2/24, 12:56 PM - +263 77 540 5274: By tomorrow
28/2/24, 12:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. However, the plan is scheduled to begin from the month of February itself, and as your admission officer, I have personally been invested in your application and would not want you to miss out on this opportunity. Is there a possibility you could discuss this matter with him by today?
28/2/24, 1:00 PM - +263 77 540 5274: I will talk with him today and give you the feedback tomorrow morning
28/2/24, 1:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, thank you for letting me know that Tapiwa. I appreciate your cooperation and proactiveness, and will look forward to hearing from you soon. Let us conclude our discussion here for today, and we will reconnect tomorrow to proceed with the same. 

Have a blessed day ahead!

29/2/24, 8:51 AM - +263 77 540 5274: About the plan  my dad is going  to start to pay at the end of May
29/2/24, 9:54 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tapiwa,

I hope you are doing well today. I understand, please. The plan has been provided to you to ensure that we are able to consistently save in small amounts towards your higher education funds. As you might be aware, we will be processing your profile under early applications for the 2025 intake to ensure that you are able to secure a scholarship seat timely. In such a case, the registration fees towards securing the scholarship seat will be due in the month of August, which will range from $500 to $1000. We want to ensure that you do not face any last minute burdens due to the finances. 

The Financial Secure Plan is flexible, and if you wish to make alterations to it, kindly feel free to suggest the same. Our end goal is to ensure that we are able to save $1500 towards your education funds by the end of November. This amount will be adjusted against your first year of education. I hope we are together in this?
29/2/24, 10:02 AM - +263 77 540 5274: My dad will be able to save the $1500 by the end of November
29/2/24, 10:07 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, Tapiwa. Since you confirmed that you will be able to begin the plan from the month of May instead of February, would it be feasible for you to adjust your first 3 installment amounts in the subsequent months? Let me elaborate. You can either make installments of $215 from May to November. Alternatively, you can begin with the regular $150 installments from May and choose a month to adjust the initial $450 installment. Could you kindly let me know which option works best for you?
29/2/24, 10:17 AM - +263 78 665 4035: Yes we are all together in this....I have really understand
29/2/24, 10:25 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, please. May I know if you were also able to go through me previous message regarding the adjustments?
29/2/24, 11:18 AM - +263 78 665 4035: Yes l have gone through previous messages  I will let you  know in the afternoon  after I have heard What Tapiwa and Dad have decided
29/2/24, 11:21 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Surely. It is quite important to discuss with all the family members to make an informed decision. I will be waiting to hear from you soon!
