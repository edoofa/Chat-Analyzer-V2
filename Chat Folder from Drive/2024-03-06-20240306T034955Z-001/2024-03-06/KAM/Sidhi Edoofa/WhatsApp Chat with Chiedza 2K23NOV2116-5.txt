29/12/23, 2:00 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Chiedza!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in the best of Spirits. 

While I was organizing my day for today, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of $150 for the remaining part of the Edoofa Enrollment fee today. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction and make the payment of your fee today? <This message was edited>
29/12/23, 2:11 PM - +263 77 292 8153: Not yet still running around
4/1/24, 9:14 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing a fine evening today. I would like to let you know that I was not able to further connect with you recently as I was occupied with multiple calls with the university. To make up for this let us connect tomorrow at 6:00 PM for further process for our session.
5/1/24, 3:12 AM - +263 77 339 4607: Noted
5/1/24, 6:08 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well today. How are you doing this lovely evening?
5/1/24, 6:25 PM - +263 77 339 4607: We are fine
5/1/24, 7:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
5/1/24, 7:04 PM - +263 77 339 4607: We can proceed
5/1/24, 7:11 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/1/24, 7:20 PM - +263 77 339 4607: Im done
5/1/24, 7:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
5/1/24, 7:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
5/1/24, 7:59 PM - +263 77 339 4607: Clear
5/1/24, 8:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
5/1/24, 8:06 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
5/1/24, 8:44 PM - +263 77 339 4607: Yessd
5/1/24, 8:49 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
5/1/24, 8:49 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
6/1/24, 6:54 AM - +263 77 339 4607: Good morning at step 5 we were asked to pay $350 and we paid $200 on the 29 th of November and we were supposed to pay $150 by 29 December and failed. But we are working in it so that we pay on the 13th of January this year. If it is possible

This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

2/2/24, 2:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Chiedza.

I hope you are having a wonderful day. <This message was edited>
2/2/24, 2:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
2/2/24, 2:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of tomorrow.
2/2/24, 2:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
2/2/24, 2:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
2/2/24, 2:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  I hope you were able to follow through with this?
2/2/24, 3:28 PM - +263 77 339 4607: Yes we can follow
2/2/24, 4:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Glad to hear that. Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow before our session.
2/2/24, 4:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

There are several ways to improve soil fertility, including adding organic matter, such as compost or manure, to the soil; applying fertilizers; and planting cover crops. It is also important to practice good soil management techniques, such as reducing tillage and avoiding overgrazing. By improving soil fertility, farmers can increase crop yields and ensure that their land remains productive for generations to come.
5/2/24, 2:24 PM - +263 71 208 4615: 3.There are many different types of farming systems, but the most common ones are subsistence farming, intensive farming, and commercial farming. Subsistence farming is a small-scale farming system in which farmers grow crops and raise animals primarily to meet the needs of their families. This type of farming is common in developing countries and is often used to produce food for local consumption. Intensive farming, on the other hand, is a large-scale farming system in which farmers use more modern techniques to maximize production. Commercial farming is a type of farming in which farmers grow crops or raise animals for sale in the market .It is usually done for large scale production through use of farm machinery.
5/2/24, 2:24 PM - +263 71 208 4615: 5.ICT, or information and  communication technology, has become increasingly important in agriculture  in these recent years. ICT tools such as the internet, smartphones, and GPS technology are now being used to help farmers improve crop yields, manage their farms more efficiently, and connect with markets and consumers around the world.
GPS technology, for example, is being used to help farmers with tasks such as precision farming, which involves using GPS-guided tractors and other machinery to plant, fertilize, and harvest crops more accurately. Smartphones are being used to provide farmers with access to real-time data on weather, soil conditions, and crop prices.

8/2/24, 1:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Chiedza.

I hope you are all doing well. Thank you for sharing the screenshot with me. How are things with you today?
8/2/24, 1:55 PM - +263 77 339 4607: We are all fine
8/2/24, 2:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey, i.e. *Introduction to Financial Secure Plan*.
8/2/24, 2:27 PM - +263 77 339 4607: Noted
8/2/24, 2:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, before we start the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
8/2/24, 2:32 PM - +263 77 339 4607: Yes it has to be paid on or before20 February
8/2/24, 3:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better. 

In the meantime, Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Agriculture) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
8/2/24, 5:56 PM - +263 77 339 4607: Yes it's true
9/2/24, 1:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Chiedza.

I hope you are all doing well today. I was unable to respond to your last message as our operational hours had already concluded. Before we proceed with our session today, I would like to ask how your day has been going so far?
9/2/24, 1:28 PM - +263 77 339 4607: Very well thank you
9/2/24, 1:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Thank you for your confirmation about the course and year of intake. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
9/2/24, 1:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
9/2/24, 1:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
9/2/24, 6:16 PM - +263 71 208 4615: Yesss you can tell us
9/2/24, 6:18 PM - +263 77 339 4607: Yes how
9/2/24, 7:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I would like to continue with our discussion, however, as my operational hours have come to an end, let's conclude our conversation here. We will reconnect tomorrow for our next session. Our operational hours for tomorrow (Saturday) are from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM. I hope you'll be available during this time for further discussion.

I will look forward to our session tomorrow. Have a blessed night!
9/2/24, 7:49 PM - +263 71 208 4615: Noted thank you
10/2/24, 1:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Chiedza.

I trust you are having a delightful weekend. On this pleasant Saturday afternoon, I hope you are presently available for a discussion. Before we begin, I would like to check in and ask how are things with you today?
10/2/24, 1:57 PM - +263 77 339 4607: We are fine
10/2/24, 2:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. During our previous session, we were discussing about the constraints faced by some students and their parents, and that the Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan to help them. Allow me to explain further on it.
10/2/24, 2:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
10/2/24, 2:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
10/2/24, 2:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
10/2/24, 2:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
10/2/24, 2:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
10/2/24, 2:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
10/2/24, 3:03 PM - +263 77 339 4607: Interesting
10/2/24, 3:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
10/2/24, 4:00 PM - +263 71 208 4615: Yesss
10/2/24, 4:09 PM - +263 77 339 4607: Yes
12/2/24, 8:11 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Chiedza.

I hope you had a wonderful weekend. How are things with you this fine morning?
12/2/24, 8:53 AM - +263 71 208 4615: We are fine and you
12/2/24, 9:46 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am doing well, thank you for asking. During our previous session, we were discussing about how the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan works. Allow me to explain it further -
12/2/24, 9:46 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As you are aware, we are currently in February 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
12/2/24, 9:46 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
12/2/24, 9:46 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
12/2/24, 10:17 AM - +263 77 339 4607: Good idea
12/2/24, 10:18 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
12/2/24, 10:18 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
12/2/24, 10:18 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
12/2/24, 10:20 AM - +263 77 339 4607: Yes clear
12/2/24, 10:43 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
12/2/24, 10:43 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
12/2/24, 10:43 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
12/2/24, 10:43 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
12/2/24, 10:44 AM - +263 77 339 4607: This message was deleted
12/2/24, 10:44 AM - +263 77 339 4607: Yes
12/2/24, 10:52 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that we are on the same page here. Before we proceed with our discussion, as promised, now that you are a part of the Edoofa Journey, the opportunity to help you self-fund your higher education and for you to be industry-ready s here, and in light of the same, I would like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you were scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Friday (9 February 2024).
12/2/24, 10:52 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program as previously agreed upon.

To kick start the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:
12/2/24, 10:53 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: https://chat.whatsapp.com/FKXlkDhqxiMLk90FSkpkVa
12/2/24, 10:54 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Use the above-provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Chiedza Gomana, and my EWYL group name is Chiedza EWYL23E0995. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on 12/02/2024 to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
12/2/24, 10:54 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is* _________ *and he/she has scheduled my session for* ________ (mention the date)
12/2/24, 10:54 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly let me know once you have taken a note of the same, and are able to join the group.
13/2/24, 9:58 AM - +263 77 339 4607: Joined the group
13/2/24, 10:24 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Chiedza,

I hope you are doing great. Thank you for letting me know that. Before we proceed with today's session, I would like to ask how your day has been going so far?
13/2/24, 10:50 AM - +263 77 339 4607: We are very well thank you
13/2/24, 11:13 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. During our previous discussion, we were talking about various constraints related to the dollar exchange rate, considering its fluctuation, safety concerns associated with keeping cash at home, and the expenses tied to maintaining a Nostro Account in banks for safekeeping.
13/2/24, 11:13 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
13/2/24, 11:56 AM - +263 77 339 4607: Explain further
13/2/24, 12:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay before your due date.
13/2/24, 12:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
13/2/24, 12:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
13/2/24, 1:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
13/2/24, 3:48 PM - +263 77 339 4607: Interesting
14/2/24, 8:47 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning, Parents and Chiedza,

I hope you are doing well. During our previous session, we discussed how under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, parents deposit $150 monthly for 10 months, resulting in $1500 savings. Following this, Edoofa waives $150 from the $350 Program Fee, resulting in a $150 saving over 10 months, which is equivalent to a $15 monthly return on investment. Before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to inquire, how is everything on your end today?
14/2/24, 12:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We are excited to share with you that a Meet-and-Greet Seminar has been organized this week in Harare, Zimbabwe. This event offers a unique chance to connect with Edoofa's visionaries and explore exciting opportunities.

To facilitate this event, the admission officers are playing a significant role in ensuring that all Edoofians get a chance to attend and can seize the exciting opportunities Edoofa has in store for them. Therefore, we will be unavailable until next week. We will reconnect with you next Thursday to proceed with our discussions and move ahead in your application process.
14/2/24, 12:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: On this note, we extend our invitation for you to join us at the Meet-and-Greet Seminar. The venue and time slot for your session are pending confirmation, we anticipate it will be held either on Saturday or Tuesday. You will soon receive a formal invitation from our team so that you can register for the event.

I hope you are all doing great. It has been a while since we last connected, and our team has had quite hectic past few days.

Now that things have settled down a bit, I wanted to express my sincere gratitude to you for participating in the event and playing a role in its success. I would like to share a few glimpses of the seminar with you, which demonstrates how enthusiastic and engaged our students were!

22/2/24, 1:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Wonderful! Thank you for sharing these pictures with me. I am so happy to hear that you had a good time at the seminar. 

During our previous session, we discussed how under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, parents deposit $150 monthly for 10 months, resulting in $1500 savings.

Until then, I wish you a blessed week ahead. Kindly convey my regards to your family as well.
22/2/24, 3:32 PM - +263 77 339 4607: We are fine . We are still working on this and to calculate especially with the bank charges . If things go well we may start after paying for chiedza's examination fees that is at the end of March and April.

26/2/24, 10:44 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Chiedza,

I hope you had a wonderful weekend. Over the weekend, our team engaged in discussions regarding the Meet and Greet Seminar, reflecting on the valuable insights gained from interacting with our students. The experience was truly enriching for us, and we hope it was equally enjoyable for you as well.

Before we proceed with our discussion today, I would like to inquire how you are doing this fine morning?
26/2/24, 10:47 AM - +263 77 339 4607: Very well thank you
26/2/24, 10:59 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Up until now, we have discussed how under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, parents deposit $150 monthly for 10 months, resulting in $1500 savings. Following this, Edoofa waives $150 from the $350 Program Fee, resulting in a $150 saving over 10 months, which is equivalent to a $15 monthly return on investment. Allow me to share more information with you.
26/2/24, 10:59 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
26/2/24, 10:59 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
26/2/24, 11:00 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
26/2/24, 11:00 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
2/3/24, 3:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Chiedza,

I hope you are having a pleasant Saturday afternoon. With the team focused on preparations for the Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare, it has been a few days since we have been able to connect on a regular basis. Hence, I am reaching out to schedule our next session on Monday between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM to catch up and ensure we are back on track. Could you please let me know a convenient one-hour time slot within that window for our discussion?
2/3/24, 3:17 PM - +263 77 339 4607: 1-2pm
2/3/24, 3:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. I look forward to reconnecting with you at *1:00 PM on Monday* for our session. Have a blessed weekend!
2/3/24, 3:41 PM - +263 77 339 4607: Thank you
4/3/24, 12:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Chiedza,

I hope you are having a wonderful day. How are you all doing today?
4/3/24, 2:29 PM - +263 77 339 4607: Very well thank you
4/3/24, 2:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. During our previous session, we discussed how Edoofa Management has decided to help the students and parents with the various constraints they face. Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, parents deposit $150 monthly for 10 months, resulting in $1500 savings. Following this, Edoofa waives $150 from the $350 Program Fee, resulting in a $150 saving over 10 months, which is equivalent to a $15 monthly return on investment. 

May I know if you have been able to follow through with the details so far?
4/3/24, 2:44 PM - +263 77 339 4607: Yes I was following. Then my main  worry is about the bank charges not yet prepared for that it means it's not only $150 per month it's more than that.
4/3/24, 2:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The bank transfer charges will be a minimum of 11% depending on the mode of transfer you prefer. Usually it is from around 11% to 12.5%, which will be a total of $167 to $169.
4/3/24, 2:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand your concern about the extra charges. However, it's important to note that the amount we're saving will be adjusted against Chiedza's first year of education. The registration fee of $500 to $1000 will be due in August, as we'll be processing Chiedza's profile under early applications. Since you'll be making the transfer while still in Zimbabwe, the transfer charges will still apply. In essence, these charges are not additional, as they will be equivalent to the amount you'll be paying at the time of registration. I hope that you are able to see this perspective and we are on the same page here?
4/3/24, 3:02 PM - +263 77 339 4607: Thought it was $20%
4/3/24, 3:03 PM - +263 77 339 4607: Yes
4/3/24, 3:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It depends according to the payment methods you have selected. In case you opt for direct international bank transfer, the charges will be a minimum of 18%. However, we also have options to make the payment through our local associates which helps in reducing the margin a bit. I hope this helps with your query? <This message was edited>

4/3/24, 3:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now, if you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason the plan explained up until now is for 10 months and not 20 months is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
4/3/24, 3:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
4/3/24, 3:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
4/3/24, 3:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
4/3/24, 3:18 PM - +263 77 339 4607: Interesting
4/3/24, 3:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
4/3/24, 3:41 PM - +263 77 339 4607: Correct
4/3/24, 3:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
4/3/24, 3:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
4/3/24, 3:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
4/3/24, 4:52 PM - +263 77 339 4607: Sounds good
5/3/24, 9:38 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Chiedza,

I hope you are doing good. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most people can discuss this with their family the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
5/3/24, 9:40 AM - +263 77 339 4607: Noted by this coming Friday
5/3/24, 9:46 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Since the number of seats for the plan are limited and we only have 15 seats remaining, I would not want you to miss out on this amazing opportunity. May I know if it will be possible for you to have this discussion with your family within the next 2 days?
5/3/24, 9:59 AM - +263 77 339 4607: Yes
5/3/24, 10:07 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. In such a case, let us reconnect on Thursday morning. I hope that you will be able to have this discussion with your family by then.

I wish you and your family a blessed day ahead! <This message was edited>
