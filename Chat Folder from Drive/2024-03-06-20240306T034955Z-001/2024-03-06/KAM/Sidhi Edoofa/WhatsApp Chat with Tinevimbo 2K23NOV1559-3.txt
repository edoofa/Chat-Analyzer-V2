I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
31/1/24, 1:57 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Yes go ahead
31/1/24, 2:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 2:24 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Done
31/1/24, 2:24 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Lets proceed
31/1/24, 2:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
31/1/24, 2:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
31/1/24, 3:03 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Its clear
31/1/24, 3:03 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: This one it has to be filled with the student right? Not us parents, confirm
31/1/24, 3:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct. However, if Tinevimbo is unavailable to do so, you may take his inputs and fill the form on his behalf. It is crucial that Tinevimbo shares his inputs for the same, as the Statement of Purpose will be a representation of his skills and interests.
31/1/24, 3:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps - 

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
31/1/24, 3:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
31/1/24, 3:49 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Following
31/1/24, 3:50 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: So what exactly will you be assisting with here?
31/1/24, 4:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We will be offering you a flexible payment plan, that you can avail in order to prevent any last minute financial constraints or challenges that might come your way due to unforeseen situations.
31/1/24, 4:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
31/1/24, 4:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
31/1/24, 4:42 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: On the issue of Acceptance letter how do i know we have been accepted with the best University. Because the issue is for the child to get the best quality education. What criteria will you be using in choosing the Universities
31/1/24, 5:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The Edoofa Scholarship Program has worked with over 250 universities, all of which are recognized by UGC (University Grants Commission) and AICTE (All India Council for Technical Education). We have been working in the industry for the past 15+ years, and have carefully hand-picked these universities that excel in exposure, affordability, culture, and academics. <This message was edited>
31/1/24, 5:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The Academic Board at Edoofa will evaluate students' applications in the month of August. Based on various factors such as their A Level Statement of Entry, O Level Results, merit, extracurricular activities, Statement of Purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa, they will finalize a list of universities where your child's application will be shared. Subsequently, you will receive offer letters from these universities and will have the option to choose the best university for Tinevimbo if you receive multiple offer letters. Until then, our goal is to assist you in preparing your educational finances so that once you receive the offer letters, you can secure the scholarship seat promptly. I hope you are clear with this?
31/1/24, 6:30 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Thats very clear. Thank you for the insight.
31/1/24, 7:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I was looking forward to continuing our conversation, however, my operational hours for the day have concluded, and I have had a long day already. Let us conclude our conversation for today and we will reconnect tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the Financial Secure Plan. Have a blessed night!
31/1/24, 7:17 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Thank you, good night

I hope you are having a lovely day. May I know how you all are doing today?
2/2/24, 2:01 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Lets go
3/2/24, 9:25 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Tinevimbo.

I hope you are having a wonderful morning. Kindly excuse me for not being able to proceed with our discussions in the past 2 days as our team has been very occupied with the preparation of our upcoming Zimbabwe trip. Rest assured, I am glad that we can reconnect today and proceed with our discussion smoothly. Before we do so, how are you and your family doing today?
3/2/24, 9:29 AM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: The weekend is great this side i hope your preparations are going well.
3/2/24, 9:30 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am so pleased to hear that. Everything is well this side. We are really excited to visit our Edoofians in their home country! Our team will soon reach out to you with more details once they have been finalized.
3/2/24, 9:31 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moving forward with today's discussion, now that you have gone through all 6 steps, if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
3/2/24, 9:31 AM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Thats alright, looking foward to get updates
3/2/24, 9:34 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that. May I know if you were able to go through this message and are ready to proceed with the 1st step i.e., Message from the founder's office?
3/2/24, 9:35 AM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Yes go ahead
3/2/24, 9:36 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
3/2/24, 9:36 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
3/2/24, 9:40 AM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Can you kindly share the videos so that i can watch then on a good time and then i will let you know when im done.
3/2/24, 9:41 AM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: The environment i am at the moment doesnt allow me to watch videos
3/2/24, 9:45 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
3/2/24, 9:45 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
3/2/24, 9:45 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
3/2/24, 9:45 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
3/2/24, 9:45 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, since you mention that you will need some time to watch the videos, our next session will be scheduled for Monday after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding.
5/2/24, 2:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
5/2/24, 2:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of tomorrow.
5/2/24, 2:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
5/2/24, 2:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
5/2/24, 2:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly let me know once you are able to go through the explanations.
5/2/24, 2:40 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Loud and clear, thanks for enlighting me more.
5/2/24, 2:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose. I hope you were able to follow through with this?
5/2/24, 2:59 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Yes yes
5/2/24, 3:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move Tinevimbo's application ahead and help Tinevimbo to write a proper statement of purpose so that he can get into the best University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on Tinevimbo's application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, we would require Tinevimbo's availability for approximately 30 minutes. If he is unavailable, he can provide you with his input, and you can proceed with the statement of purpose on his behalf. <This message was edited>
5/2/24, 3:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in Tinevimbo's admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
5/2/24, 3:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete the task that has been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan. <This message was edited>
5/2/24, 3:33 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: He can be available tomorrow
5/2/24, 3:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow for our next session. 

Also, as promised, now that you are a part of the Edoofa Journey, the opportunity to help you self-fund your higher education and for you to be industry-ready s here, and in light of the same, I would like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Tuesday (6 February 2024).
5/2/24, 3:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Tuesday, as previously agreed upon.

To kick start the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:
5/2/24, 3:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: https://chat.whatsapp.com/BQdA2CN42JBIScvmF3xjzG

Tinevimbo EWYL23E0956
5/2/24, 3:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Use the above-provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

5/2/24, 3:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

6/2/24, 8:49 AM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Noted, thank you
6/2/24, 1:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tinevimbo.

I hope you are all doing wonderful today. How has your day been going so far?
6/2/24, 1:06 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Its going well
6/2/24, 1:06 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: How are you
6/2/24, 1:06 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: This message was deleted
6/2/24, 1:08 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: *Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is Ananya and he/she has scheduled my session for 06/02/2024*
6/2/24, 1:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the message with me. I am pleased to hear that your day is going well. Everything is good here, thank you for asking. May I know if you were able to complete the SOP form that I shared with you yesterday?
6/2/24, 2:50 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Not yet will be able to fill in tonight
6/2/24, 3:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In such a case, I will look forward to receiving an update from your end once you are able to complete the form, and in the meanwhile, let us move forward with our discussion.
6/2/24, 3:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BCom (Accounting and International Finance) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
6/2/24, 3:30 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Thats correct
6/2/24, 3:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
6/2/24, 3:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
6/2/24, 3:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
6/2/24, 3:32 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Go ahead
6/2/24, 4:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
6/2/24, 4:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
6/2/24, 4:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
6/2/24, 4:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
6/2/24, 4:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
6/2/24, 4:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
7/2/24, 1:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tinevimbo.

I hope you are having a lovely day. How are things with you today?
8/2/24, 1:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tinevimbo,

I trust this message finds you well. I had hoped to hear back from you yesterday but it seems we were unable to connect. I understand that things can get busy, so I wanted to reach out today to ensure everything is alright on your end. If there's anything you need assistance with or any questions you have, please don't hesitate to let me know
8/2/24, 1:42 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Appologies for the late responses, i was travelling since yesterday. I will fill in the form today in the night when i gwt to Harare.
8/2/24, 1:42 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: This side network is bad
8/2/24, 1:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Thank you for letting me know that. May I know if you are available and have stable network to have our discussion regarding the Financial Secure Plan?
8/2/24, 2:06 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: If there is no videos to download i think my network can do now
8/2/24, 3:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the delay in my response sir. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
8/2/24, 3:33 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: yes yes
8/2/24, 3:33 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Please enlighten me
8/2/24, 3:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in February 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
8/2/24, 3:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
8/2/24, 3:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
8/2/24, 4:01 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Makes sense, i agree 💯
8/2/24, 4:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
8/2/24, 4:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
8/2/24, 4:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
8/2/24, 4:18 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Very clear im getting the strategy.
9/2/24, 12:57 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: <Media omitted>
9/2/24, 1:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tinevimbo.

I hope you are all doing great today. How has your day been going so far?
9/2/24, 1:04 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: SO far so good cant complain
9/2/24, 1:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Thank you for sharing the screenshot of the SOP form, I have duly taken a note of the same. During our previous session, we were discussing about how the Financial Secure Plan works. Allow me to proceed with the same -
9/2/24, 1:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: There is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
9/2/24, 1:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
9/2/24, 1:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
9/2/24, 1:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
9/2/24, 2:40 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Thats true
9/2/24, 3:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to hear. Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
9/2/24, 5:54 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Please enlighten us
9/2/24, 6:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I would like to continue with our discussion, however, as my operational hours have come to an end, let's conclude our conversation here. We will reconnect tomorrow for our next session. Our operational hours for tomorrow (Saturday) are from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM. I hope you'll be available during this time for further discussion.

I will look forward to our session tomorrow. Have a blessed night! <This message was edited>
10/2/24, 1:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tinevimbo.

I trust you are having a delightful weekend. On this pleasant Saturday afternoon, I hope you are presently available for a discussion. Before we begin, I would like to check in and ask how are things with you today?
10/2/24, 1:34 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Im very well
10/2/24, 1:34 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Im now available we can start
10/2/24, 2:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. During our previous session, we discussed about the various constraints faced by the students and their parents. Allow me to explain how the Edoofa Management has managed to come up with a plan to help them.
10/2/24, 2:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
10/2/24, 2:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay before your due date
10/2/24, 2:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
10/2/24, 2:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
10/2/24, 2:29 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: I have paid all the money before the 23rd of December last year.
10/2/24, 2:30 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Yes explain
10/2/24, 2:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that sir. Could you kindly share the receipt of the payment with me, so that our accounts team can very and confirm your payment?
12/2/24, 12:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Aternoon Parents and Tinevimbo.

I hope you had a wonderful weekend. I had hoped to hear back from you on Saturday but it seems we were unable to connect. I understand that things can get busy, so I wanted to reach out today to ensure everything is alright on your end. <This message was edited>
12/2/24, 12:54 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: im very well, thank you
12/2/24, 12:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. May I know if you were able to go through my last message on Saturday and will be able to share the receipt of your payment with me?
12/2/24, 1:01 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: The money was send to Precious Jerera via Inbucks with my Father. Unfortunately my father is not online now.
12/2/24, 1:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. You must have received a confirmation message on your phone with the payment reference ID. When you are able to get in touch with him, could you kindly share proof of payment with me?
12/2/24, 1:42 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Thats not a problem i will ask him to do so
12/2/24, 2:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. In the meanwhile, let us proceed with our previous discussion about how the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan works.
12/2/24, 2:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
12/2/24, 2:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
12/2/24, 2:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
12/2/24, 2:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
12/2/24, 2:38 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: $170.00 InnBucks sent to Precious Jerera. 
Available Balance: $13.90
Reference: 334452270
Above is the proof of payment to JERERA PRECIOUS.
12/2/24, 2:39 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: POP
12/2/24, 3:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me. I have taken a note of it and will update your application profile accordingly. May I know if you were able to go through my previous messages?
12/2/24, 3:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Could you kindly confirm the date of your payment as well?
12/2/24, 3:06 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Hes yes just finished now. I think is well explained i am understanding the concept
12/2/24, 5:12 PM - +263 77 772 5401: Last payment was made on 20 November 2023. It was deposited into PRECIOUS JERERA's account as advised.
12/2/24, 5:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that you were able to go through the message and also for sharing the date of payment. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
13/2/24, 12:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tinevimbo,

I trust this message finds you well. I had hoped to hear back from you yesterday but it seems we were unable to connect. I understand that things can get busy, so I wanted to reach out today to ensure everything is alright on your end.
13/2/24, 1:04 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Good afternoon, lets go aheard with our session
13/2/24, 1:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Allow me to explain how the rest of the plan will work. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
13/2/24, 1:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
13/2/24, 1:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
13/2/24, 1:42 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: It sounds great
13/2/24, 1:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
13/2/24, 1:48 PM - Tinashe Zengeya -  Estate Manager ZW: Very well clear, i will discuss with my parents as well.
14/2/24, 8:53 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Greetings, Parents and Tinevimbo!

I hope you are all doing great. It has been a while since we last connected, and our team has had quite hectic past few days. As you already know, over the past three days, Team Edoofa has been bustling with activity – both in India and Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. Now that things have settled down a bit, I wanted to express my sincere gratitude to you for participating in the event and playing a role in its success. I would like to share a few glimpses of the seminar with you, which demonstrates how enthusiastic and engaged our students were!
