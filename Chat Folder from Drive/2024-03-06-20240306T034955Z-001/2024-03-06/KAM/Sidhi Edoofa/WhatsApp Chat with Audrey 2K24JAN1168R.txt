I hope this message finds you well. We are excited to share with you that a Meet-and-Greet Seminar has been organized this week in Harare, Zimbabwe. This event offers a unique chance to connect with Edoofa's visionaries and explore exciting opportunities.

To facilitate this event, the admission officers are playing a significant role in ensuring that all Edoofians get a chance to attend and can seize the exciting opportunities Edoofa has in store for them. Therefore, we will be unavailable until next week. We will reconnect with you next Thursday to proceed with our discussions and move ahead in your application process.

I hope you are all doing great. It has been a while since we last connected, and our team has had quite hectic past few days. As you already know, over the past three days, Team Edoofa has been bustling with activity – both in India and Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. I would like to share a few glimpses of the seminar with you, which demonstrates how enthusiastic and engaged our students were!

Until then, I wish you a blessed week ahead. Kindly convey my regards to your family as well.
26/2/24, 10:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Audrey,

I hope you had a wonderful weekend. Over the weekend, our team engaged in discussions regarding the Meet and Greet Seminar, reflecting on the valuable insights gained from interacting with our students. The experience was truly enriching for us, and we hope it was equally enjoyable for you as well.

Before we proceed with our discussion today, I would like to inquire how you are doing this fine morning?
2/3/24, 1:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Audrey,

I hope you are having a pleasant Saturday afternoon. With the team focused on preparations for the Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare, it has been a few days since we have been able to connect on a regular basis. Hence, I am reaching out to schedule our next session on Monday between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM to catch up and ensure we are back on track. Could you please let me know a convenient one-hour time slot within that window for our discussion?
5/3/24, 10:34 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Audrey,

I hope you are doing well. I have been hoping to get a response from your end in the past few days, however we have not been able to connect with each other. May I know if we are still connected and if everything is well on your end?
5/3/24, 2:36 PM - +263 77 261 8946: Good afternoon
Sure we're still together. A bit of challenges though but still on track🙏
5/3/24, 2:37 PM - +263 77 261 8946: Looking forward to balancing off my application deposit
5/3/24, 2:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Thank you for letting me know that. <This message was edited>
5/3/24, 2:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are filled with energy and excitement which has been fueled by the successful meet and greet sessions we hosted at the Martin Luther King Family of Schools, Harare last week. 

The entire Edoofa Team returned from Zimbabwe with a wealth of learnings, experiences, and opportunities for our students. Before I get into our experiences and the opportunities we were able to secure for our students, I wanted to check in and see if you were able to attend the seminar?
5/3/24, 2:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I checked our records, but unfortunately, I could not find your RSVP status. It is possible that there may have been an oversight, and so I wanted to reach out to you and your family directly to confirm.

Could you please let me know if you were able to attend the seminar and meet with us in your home country?
5/3/24, 4:07 PM - +263 77 261 8946: Yes its possible. Unfortunately that was a missed opportunity
5/3/24, 4:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I could not quite understand, please. May I know if you were unable to attend the seminar? <This message was edited>
5/3/24, 4:43 PM - +263 77 261 8946: I failed to sponsor Audrey in time for the seminar
5/3/24, 4:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's perfectly understandabl. I appreciate your candor, and I understand that sometimes unforeseen circumstances prevent us from attending events. Since you were unable to attend the seminar, would you like to know how many students and parents attended the seminar over just three days?
5/3/24, 4:58 PM - +263 77 261 8946: May you share
5/3/24, 5:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: There were over 2700 attendees and out of these 2,700 attendees, our team had the privilege of engaging in 30-minute one-on-one sessions with 487 students, including Mr. Austin, Ms. Vilsha, Mr. Abhinav, Mr. Jyotishman, and Mr. Piyush and the directors of Edoofa.
5/3/24, 5:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: These exclusive interactions have been instrumental in guiding students forward on their educational paths. Additionally, I would like to share some impactful videos with you. One highlight was our rendition of the industrial visit, SLICE-CON, showcasing how our Indian Edoofians are prepared for the professional world. We also recorded messages from these students specifically for you.

Given the network challenges in Zimbabwe, I suggest finding a Wi-Fi location to download these videos. They offer a glimpse into life in India and will for sure resonate with your aspirations.
