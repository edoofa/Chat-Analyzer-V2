I the mother will be taking my sick mother for check up.And the father will be at a church conference which is starting today.I thought some of the reasons will be private and confidential, the reason why I didn't share them here,I thought you would just trust us and take the excuse as genuine
16/2/24, 12:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand, ma'am. I never doubted the genuineness of your reasons for being unavailable; I simply sought clarity on why you wouldn't be able to attend the event, since  attending the event will give you the opportunity to clarify any queries that you might have and get a better understanding of the educational journey that lies ahead of you; and I would not want you to miss it for your own benefit. If you had expressed a desire to keep your reasons private, I would have respected that completely. I apologize if my inquiry made you feel uncomfortable.
16/2/24, 12:43 PM - +263 77 336 0264: No need for an appology Ms Siddhi,I haven't been offended at all.

27/2/24, 5:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As Tinotenda's parent, you have the authority to fill out the form and initiate the EWYL process on his behalf. Once you've joined the group, please inform your designated EWYL mentor about Tinotenda's availability, and they will schedule the sessions accordingly. Timely commencement of the EWYL program is crucial to ensure a smooth admission process. I hope we are together in this?
27/2/24, 5:43 PM - +263 77 336 0264: I have a very tight schedule and I don't think I will be able to do this for Tinotenda,why can't we just wait for him to do the projects on his own because honestly I won't be able to balance between work and the programs, it will be too hectic for me
27/2/24, 5:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The EWYL program is designed for Tinotenda's participation. By initiation of the program, I mean completing the initial formalities of joining the group and adding Tinotenda to it. Once you've joined the group, you can inform your EWYL mentor about Tinotenda's availability starting from April, and they will schedule the sessions accordingly to ensure Tinotenda's participation. Does this clarify things, ma'am?
27/2/24, 5:48 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Yes you have clarified,so which dates should I fill on the Program Pledge
27/2/24, 5:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As mentioned in the message above, your EWYL is scheduled to begin on 1 March 2024. Kindly fill the same date on the form as well.

28/2/24, 2:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am doing fine please, thank you for asking. I have successfully received the EWYL form from your end and we are ready to move forward with our discussion. Moving forward, I would like to bring an important aspect to your attention. The collective aim that we have for the student strongly values balanced involvement from parents, especially when the student is unable to participate. Your proactive engagement holds significant weight, and if, for any reason, either you or your guardians won't be available, we kindly request you to inform us beforehand so that we can plan and schedule our discussion beforehand. I hope you have taken note of this as well?
28/2/24, 2:42 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Noted
28/2/24, 3:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two WhatsApp groups to connect with the team: <This message was edited>
28/2/24, 3:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Tinotenda 2K24JAN3054R)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
28/2/24, 3:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Tinotenda EWYL23E1293)* . In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
28/2/24, 4:18 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Very clear indeed
28/2/24, 4:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
28/2/24, 4:39 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Yes I am ready
28/2/24, 4:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/2/24, 4:48 PM - +263 77 336 0264: I am through
28/2/24, 5:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
28/2/24, 5:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
28/2/24, 5:12 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Very clear indeed
28/2/24, 5:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps -

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
28/2/24, 5:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
28/2/24, 5:30 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Am following very well
28/2/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
28/2/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
28/2/24, 5:32 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Very clear
28/2/24, 6:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, we will discuss the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office* during our session tomorrow. Let us conclude our conversation here, and we will reconnect tomorrow to proceed with our discussion.

Hence, I am reaching out to schedule our next session on Monday between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM to catch up and ensure we are back on track. Could you please let me know a convenient one-hour time slot within that window for our discussion?
2/3/24, 1:20 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Good afternoon Ms Siddhi,we are all fine.Hope you are having a good time too.Schedule us between 1.30pm and 2.00pm for our Monday session

4/3/24, 1:40 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Sure please
4/3/24, 1:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
4/3/24, 1:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding during tomorrow’s session. You may take today’s time for the same. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
4/3/24, 1:54 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Am ready you can proceed

4/3/24, 2:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled for tomorrow after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarise your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly for tomorrow?
4/3/24, 2:07 PM - +263 77 336 0264: The problem is I don't have Wifi facility so I have to find some data of which it is too expensive, isn't there another option or is it possible to just open those videos with a few Mega bytes
4/3/24, 2:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In such a case, may I know if sharing the audio version of these videos will be more feasible for you?
4/3/24, 2:09 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Yes that will be better
4/3/24, 2:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Allow me some time to share the audio files with you.
4/3/24, 2:16 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Okay
4/3/24, 2:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

I hope by then you will be able to go through the videos. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed rest of the day and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
4/3/24, 2:53 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Thank you
5/3/24, 10:33 AM - +263 77 336 0264: Good morning Ms Siddhi, hope you are fine.I tried to go over the audios but honestly speaking,I did not get anything, the audios were not audible enough plus am not used to the speed and tone so I did not get anything 😭😭😭
5/3/24, 10:40 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tinotenda,

I hope you are doing well. I understand please. In such a case, may I know if it will not be possible for any of your family members to access the video files?
5/3/24, 10:53 AM - +263 77 336 0264: Maybe Tinotenda will be able but it will be during his term break
5/3/24, 10:54 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. The videos hold an important message which will help you in understanding your admission process and your educational prospects in a much better way. In such a case, may I know if it will be suitable for you if I help you understand the message by the founders right now and you can go through the videos later when it is feasible for you?
5/3/24, 10:59 AM - +263 77 336 0264: Yes you may help me
5/3/24, 11:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Mr. Angad, our founder, talks about how as a new Edoofian, you're embarking on a journey that holds immense promise. In the video, he talks about some examples of Edoofa Scholarship Beneficiaries from the past three years. These are students we've met at airports and colleges, now living their dream lives in India. These students are living their dreams, and their daily smiles reflect their overall life satisfaction, not just gratitude towards Edoofa. They attend classes with confidence, knowing they're receiving a life-transforming education, and their friends congratulate them on their scholarships. Their success brings joy to everyone at Edoofa. <This message was edited>
5/3/24, 11:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: He then talks about his recent visit to Africa, and how he met students, dignitaries, and the Speaker of Parliament in Ghana. He gained valuable insights into the challenges students face and the education system there. We identified many high-potential students who fit Edoofa's vision - individuals we aim to empower with life-changing opportunities. We also studied successful and unsuccessful individuals within the African community to identify common factors.

We identified people who are not open minded and are not teachable and blame the circumstances and who only wish for things to happen and who themselves don’t take challenges but the cusp of its neck. And then there are certain other people, people who find success, such people are always open minded, and are willing to go the extra mile. <This message was edited>
5/3/24, 11:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: He goes on to share an inspiring anecdote about the legendary Steve Jobs, the visionary founder of Apple Computers. At the age of 12, Steve Jobs, intrigued by frequency calculators, reached out to the CEO of Hewlett-Packard, Mr. Bill Hewlett, for spare parts. At that time one of the biggest electronics companies was Hewlett-Packard, HP. Impressed by his resourcefulness, Mr. Hewlett not only provided guidance but also hired Steve as an intern. The key takeaway here is the power of seeking help in the right manner. By enrolling in the program, you've taken a crucial step towards your successful future, and we're here as experts to support you every step of the way. <This message was edited>
5/3/24, 11:17 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The key takeaways from this video are:
	1) Ensure you follow instructions diligently.
	2) Maintain an open-minded approach as you embark on this journey.
5/3/24, 11:17 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know if you were able to go through the above messages that explain the first video, ma'am?
5/3/24, 1:11 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Sure, and I quite understand that, thank you for the clear explanation
5/3/24, 1:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the second video, Mr. Angad talks about you - our student. He shares our vision, plans, and goals for you, along with our expectations. He starts off with a story to illustrate our purpose.

One student from Ghana registered on our platform and interacted with our career counsellor and program manager. We accepted him and offered him an enrollment letter. During the call, he shared a heartbreaking story. He paid $1000 to an agent in Ghana who promised to arrange his admission to a specific Chinese university. Regrettably, the agent continued to demand additional funds, prolonging the process and causing frustration for the student. Despite paying, there was no progress after one month, and the student's repeated inquiries went unanswered. Similarly, three months elapsed without any developments, until the agent requested an additional $300 for shipping the documents from China to Ghana, further delaying the situation. This story of the student was mind-boggling as we are in a digital era and we are sitting in and living our lives in, who need $300 to get the documents shipped at this point of time. It highlights the challenges students face in navigating higher education.
5/3/24, 1:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We have been helping students for the last 3 years and there are over 1000 students from Africa who are already here in India and these are those students who followed instructions and is open minded, you know when students share their experiences and stories that Edoofa has got all of this robust systems and processes, the counselling session and the  scholarship is great because Edoofa has their relationship with over 250 schools colleges and universities all across India, and Edoofa is transparent with every process. Our vision goes beyond admission. We understand the importance of employability in today's job market. That's why we offer scholarships, affordable education, and an "Earn While You Learn" program. You've already received information about this program. Recently, some of our students including Tiriwashe got their scholarship credits and used it to waive his entire semester tuition fee!

As an Edoofian, you'll benefit from the scholarships and scholarship credits, the Earn While You Learn program, a supportive community of like-minded students, valuable skills gained through part-time opportunities and the brand value of being an Edoofian
5/3/24, 1:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Over the past few years, we've observed certain obstacles preventing students from achieving their goals. During my visit to Africa, a student expected a fully-funded scholarship, plane ticket, and admission with low grades. While we understand that circumstances can affect academic performance, potential is more important than past results. However, a positive attitude and willingness to follow instructions are crucial.

Many institutions value our recommendations, built on trust and following established protocols. Bypassing expert guidance or scholarship protocols can hinder your success.

We've encountered students who feel entitled to handouts due to past challenges. While empathy is important, long-term success requires understanding structure, policies, and protocols. This is true for both students and parents. We want to guide you, but ultimately, you must be open-minded, coachable, and attentive to your counsellor's guidance.
5/3/24, 1:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine a vast ocean representing the world of opportunities: scholarships, jobs, businesses, or even making a positive impact on society. Now, imagine a cup and a tank. The cup holds a limited amount of water (success) from the ocean, while the tank can hold gallons. This represents two students with different capacities for success.

Taking complete ownership and understanding our vision is key. We want to help you grow your capacity for success from a cup to a tank.
5/3/24, 1:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know if you were also able to go through the summary of the 2nd video that I have shared above?
5/3/24, 1:51 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Yes, I have just gone through it
5/3/24, 2:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Now in the 3rd video Mr. Angad talks about the importance of watching the videos. These videos are important because the next step for you is the step 5 of the Edoofa Cycle, which is the University Interaction and we want to make sure that you are prepared enough to interact with the prestigious universities. So the faster or the quicker you watch these videos or read this message, the quicker you will make notes, the quicker you will be prepared. Sometimes when students look at the Edoofa website, they talk to other students, they look at the student’s video testimonials, they look at the google reviews and they think to themselves that all of these students are happy, they are passing with flying colours, they are living their dreams live, and wonder how exactly is it happening, and what’s the reason behind it and this video is exactly all about that because you are able to see only the tip of the iceberg, you only able to see one percent of the reason. The real secret behind it is 10 years  of hard work that we have invested into creating these systems and platforms and this entire network has a lot of resources for you so that you can pass with flying colours and live the life of dreams.
5/3/24, 2:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For your university experience, quality and ethical practices are our top priorities. We meticulously select universities based on accreditation, faculty qualifications, and the use of English as the primary language. We avoid institutions solely focused on profit and choose those with established reputations and a commitment to education. Our experience has shown that some institutions prioritise profit over student well-being. However, by choosing Edoofa, you can rest assured that you'll be placed in a reputable university that meets our strict criteria and offers the "Earn While You Learn" program to enhance your employability.
5/3/24, 2:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Beyond academic success, Edoofa prioritizes your employability. We've observed that successful individuals possess not only knowledge but also the right attitude and practical skills. Therefore, we've carefully selected universities that offer the "Earn While You Learn" program, giving you valuable work experience alongside your studies. This combination equips you with the necessary skills and confidence to thrive in your future career.

By choosing Edoofa, you can rest assured that you'll be placed in a reputable university that emphasizes employability through the "Earn While You Learn" program.
5/3/24, 2:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly let me know once you are able to go through the above messages.
5/3/24, 2:33 PM - +263 77 336 0264: I am through
5/3/24, 2:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. In the last video, he talks about the importance of Statement of Purpose. Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
5/3/24, 2:38 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Understood please
5/3/24, 2:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. In such a case, we are now done with discussing the videos. However, I would urge you to go through the videos if you are able to find a stable network connection. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose. I hope you were able to follow through with this?
5/3/24, 2:51 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Sure please
5/3/24, 2:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move Tinotenda's application ahead and help him to write a proper statement of purpose so that he can get into the best University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on Tinotenda's application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, we would require Tinotenda's availability for approximately 30 minutes. If he is unavailable, he can provide you with his input, and you can proceed with the statement of purpose on his behalf. I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow before our session.
5/3/24, 2:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in Tinotenda's admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
5/3/24, 2:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit Tinotenda's responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure to share his inputs and that he has researched well before starting the task. All the best!
5/3/24, 2:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/3/24, 2:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/3/24, 2:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Along with these tasks, I want you to share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result or Letter of Recommendation or Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
5/3/24, 3:02 PM - +263 77 336 0264: I don't have access to Tinotenda for me to get his input, can't this wait till term break which is just around the corner
5/3/24, 3:05 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Also for his o'level results, the certificate is still at his school,we haven't collected it as yet.And for the A'level ones he hasn't written yet neither does he have a statement of entry because they have not registered for the exams yet
5/3/24, 3:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Surely, he can share these details once he is available. Regarding the O-Level results, may I know if you have access to the online portal where his results can be collected? If yes, you can share the same with us.
5/3/24, 3:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand that you are yet to sit for your A-Level examinations. In such a case, as a part of your application file, you will need to visit your school and secure a letter of recommendation from them. We have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process.
5/3/24, 3:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/3/24, 3:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, *your subject combination for A Level exams*, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
5/3/24, 3:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to inquire by when will you be able to share the letter of recommendation and the rest of the documents with us?
5/3/24, 3:35 PM - +263 77 336 0264: I don't have access to the online portal, what I know is the platform is closed 5 days after the release of results.The only way out is to collect the certificate from the school which I don't think will be soon, maybe by May we will have collected it
5/3/24, 3:35 PM - +263 77 336 0264: Maybe in May
5/3/24, 3:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In such a case, kindly share the documents with us once you have them in your possession. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 1:30 PM for our next session.
5/3/24, 3:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as promised, now that you are a part of the Edoofa Journey, the opportunity to help you self-fund your higher education and for you to be industry-ready s here, and in light of the same, I would like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey.

To kick start the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

5/3/24, 4:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand ma'am. Our discussion has been prolonged for today due to the fact that we were discussing the videos over the chat.

May I know if this sounds feasible for you? <This message was edited>

5/3/24, 5:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The EWYL program is designed for Tinotenda's participation ma'am. For now, you are only required to join to the group and let them know that Tinotenda is going to be available in April. Your designated mentor will schedule Tinotenda's session accordingly.
