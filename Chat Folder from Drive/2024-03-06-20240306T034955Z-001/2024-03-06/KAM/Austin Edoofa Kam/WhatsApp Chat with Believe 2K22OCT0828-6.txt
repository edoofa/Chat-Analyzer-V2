I firmly believe that with the commencement of this new year, comes the promise of fresh beginnings, guiding the way for the actualization of one's deepest dreams and aspirations. As we stand on the threshold of this promising year, I am filled with excitement for the adventures it holds.
6/1/24, 1:15 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the same spirit, I would like to share that I am embarking on a journey as I prepare myself to pursue my doctorate and take a step forward in my academic pursuits. This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.
6/1/24, 1:15 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The decision to transition to a new phase in my life presents an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of students, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience remain enriched and fulfilling.

As I embark on this new journey, I want to assure you that I have entrusted your application file to capable hands. From this point forward, your admission journey will be seamlessly guided by one of our accomplished admission officers, *Ms. Siddhi,* who will connect with you on Tuesday.  I hope you will make yourself available for further procedures and will give your best to your career.
6/1/24, 1:15 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments. Wish you all the best, and God Bless.

Mr. Shiveet
Edoofa Admission Team.
6/1/24, 1:45 PM - +263 77 709 8241: I greatly appreciate your help ,may you be successful in  all your life endeavors
8/1/24, 2:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Believe,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honoured to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
8/1/24, 2:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
8/1/24, 2:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 2:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
8/1/24, 2:37 PM - +263 77 709 8241: Wonderful greetings to you
8/1/24, 2:37 PM - +263 77 709 8241: Congratulations 🎊,
8/1/24, 3:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you, Believe.
8/1/24, 3:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: A new year brings forth a multitude of possibilities and fresh opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practice more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?
8/1/24, 4:19 PM - +263 77 709 8241: It is a wonderful opportunity meeting you, and having you assist me in partaking this academic journey, I'm so much honored knowing you are here to guide me accordingly. 

I stand firm with my goals and have my eyes set on my university education.
8/1/24, 4:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am so glad to hear that, dear. Absolutely, with learning comes transformative changes that offer the opportunity for personal growth and success, I am looking forward for you to explore all the adventures that lie ahead of you.
8/1/24, 5:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, I would like to shift focus to your admission process. As per your application file, it seems that you were unable to proceed with your admission formalities scheduled for August 2024. Since a few months have passed, and this is our first interaction, I would like to inquire why you were unable to do so and if now is the right time for you to focus on your university admission journey for higher education abroad.
8/1/24, 5:34 PM - +263 77 709 8241: Due to the October examinations I could not handle both the examination pressure and processes online, hence I took a break from my social media platforms. Now as I await the announcement of my results, I decided to continue with the admission process
9/1/24, 8:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is completely understandable. Working hard and concentrating on examinations is very important, and it is good to hear that you were focused on it to perform your best during examinations.

May I know if now is a good time to proceed with your admission process to ensure that you secure a scholarship seat with the best university for your education?
9/1/24, 8:17 AM - +263 77 709 8241: Wonderful greetings to you
9/1/24, 8:18 AM - +263 77 709 8241: Yes I believe now is the perfect time to proceed with the admission process
9/1/24, 9:17 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is good to hear that you are now available to take the process forward in order to ensure that you secure a scholarship seat in the best university for your higher education.

According to my records, we have completed 3 out of 6 steps for your admission process, i.e., up until Statement of Purpose and Counselling Session on University Admission. Am I correct?
9/1/24, 9:28 AM - +263 77 709 8241: Yes surely
9/1/24, 9:48 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
9/1/24, 10:02 AM - +263 77 709 8241: May you kindly walk me through the costs once more
9/1/24, 10:32 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Surely, dear. 

*To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.*
9/1/24, 10:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
9/1/24, 10:41 AM - +263 77 709 8241: Hence ,I have to apply for university first, isn't it, then after acceptance from the university and I've been given the program I want to be studying,then follows registration, is it the correct understanding I have?
9/1/24, 10:43 AM - +263 77 709 8241: On that note , I would also appreciate it if you share with me the tuition fees for different universities offering my program
9/1/24, 10:44 AM - +263 77 709 8241: I believe this information is accompanied by accommodation and cost of living.
9/1/24, 11:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, your understanding of the same is correct.
9/1/24, 12:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I would first like you to please understand that Edoofa is not an Agent wherein we are only associated with 1 University. If that would have been the case we would have told you the exact fees during the counseling session itself, the reason I shared the annual fees in a range is that Edoofa is associated with 250+ UGC recognized universities and that is why we are able to reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-$3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food, and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, and after this, we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
9/1/24, 12:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now every parent has a question that why aren't they told of a fixed annual fee beforehand so that they could plan for the cost properly. I am sure similar might have been your concern as well, which is why I would again like to bring it to your knowledge that Edoofa is not an Agent that is only associated with 1 University.

Through Edoofa a student interacts with multiple Universities during their University Interaction Stage which is Step 5 of the Edoofa Cycle as well.
9/1/24, 12:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now it is obvious that every university would evaluate a student's application differently which means, after the University interaction, when the student receives multiple offer letters stating the exact quantum of scholarship from the universities, the student and the family members are given full liberty to choose a University based on the Quantum of scholarship they have provided to the student itself. This way the parents and the student gets to choose the most affordable higher education as per their own financial plans.
9/1/24, 12:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The range of $2000 - $3000 includes the following - annual tuition fee, accommodation, food, and any other university aspects.

16/1/24, 7:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Believe,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. I was hoping to get a response from your end following my previous messages. However, in recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 7:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 7:58 PM - +263 77 709 8241: Well noted

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
17/1/24, 12:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly allow me time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once I have evaluated your results, along with all the other applications for your university admission, we will reconnect with you to discuss the next steps in your academic journey.

As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will handle the submission of your application to various universities. Once they evaluate your eligibility, if found suitable, you'll receive a comprehensive offer letter detailing the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information ensures a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
In the event that multiple universities accept your application, it's important to note that practically studying at multiple universities is not feasible right ?

30/1/24, 9:30 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
30/1/24, 9:31 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counseling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2700-$3700 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,

1. Tuition Fee: $2600 per annum
2. Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Total Fee: Tuition Fee $2600 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $3600 per annum
3. Registration Fee to be paid: $1000
30/1/24, 9:31 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education($3600-$1000= $2600) and this remaining fee of $2600 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $1300 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $1300 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.

Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?
30/1/24, 9:40 AM - +263 77 709 8241: Not yet
30/1/24, 9:40 AM - +263 77 709 8241: You may proceed
30/1/24, 10:22 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
30/1/24, 11:11 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Are we connected?
30/1/24, 11:39 AM - +263 77 709 8241: Yes clear

20/2/24, 8:41 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Did you manage to attend the Edoofa Meet and Greet Seminar 2024?
20/2/24, 10:31 AM - +263 77 709 8241: Yes I did
20/2/24, 11:54 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So how did you find the session?
20/2/24, 12:14 PM - +263 77 709 8241: It was quite helpful and beneficial to me
20/2/24, 12:34 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: And may I know what all were you able to understand more about the Edoofa Program?
20/2/24, 12:39 PM - +263 77 709 8241: The challenge now comes to the financial side for my parents ,i was in a conversation with my father who has been supporting my educational life all along,we were discussing on my tertiary education and of course the EDOOFA scholarship program got to be involved in our discussions.

Even though he has been so enthusiastic about the program, paid some of the money required, and believes that learning abroad comes with its benefits, he complained that his pockets might not allow us to take this pathway.Him being a father of 6 ,i being the second child ,there's a lot already on his shoulders. Like i have said before ,he is self-employed, and his basic income has not been quite enough to cater to all the family needs,and he believes his pockets might not go with the fee structure. In as much as the scholarship offer of 50% was on ,the fees are still unaffordable to him. He says if it was in the range of 800-1000 ,he would go through thick and thin to squeeze up in order to support my dream. <This message was edited>

20/2/24, 1:33 PM - +263 77 709 8241: I don't know if you there can be an alternative for there to be a slight decrease on the tuition fee,if it involves changing my program that would still be okay

20/2/24, 2:32 PM - +263 77 709 8241: Very well

Meal                  $550

22/2/24, 12:41 PM - +263 77 709 8241: Then accommodation and Ac,I'm not sure if it's involved also on the above calculations
22/2/24, 1:23 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Yes, please. Since you are have applied for a niche course hence the scholarship percentage  is considerably lower Believe, Since the cost of such courses are higher
22/2/24, 1:40 PM - +263 77 709 8241: Is it involved?
22/2/24, 1:40 PM - +263 77 709 8241: What is a niche course

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
26/2/24, 8:42 AM - +263 77 709 8241: Wonderful greetings to you
26/2/24, 8:59 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So before proceeding with the session, are there any questions you would like to ask?
26/2/24, 9:02 AM - +263 77 709 8241: Yes,I asked 2 questions already, but I have not been answered yet <This message was edited>
26/2/24, 9:02 AM - +263 77 709 8241: Here
26/2/24, 9:02 AM - +263 77 709 8241: Also here
26/2/24, 11:07 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Can you elaborate?
26/2/24, 11:09 AM - +263 77 709 8241: Is accommodation and ac involved in the total sum we agreed on here?
26/2/24, 11:12 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Surely, I will be sharing all the details with you today, In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
26/2/24, 12:07 PM - +263 77 709 8241: 1.$1225
2.4 years 
3.$200
4.$700
26/2/24, 12:55 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 4-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 6 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $1225 making your per annum tuition fee ($1225*2) = $2450. Is that clear?
26/2/24, 1:14 PM - +263 77 709 8241: Yess
26/2/24, 2:28 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -

*1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
26/2/24, 2:28 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
26/2/24, 2:29 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.*
26/2/24, 2:29 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.*
26/2/24, 2:29 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.
26/2/24, 2:29 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?
27/2/24, 11:05 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good Morning Everyone

Please excuse me for my unavailability yesterday, As I was not feeling well,

So are you available for the session now?
27/2/24, 11:08 AM - +263 77 709 8241: Well noted
27/2/24, 11:08 AM - +263 77 709 8241: Wonderful greetings to you, how are you feeling now
27/2/24, 11:09 AM - +263 77 709 8241: Yes available
27/2/24, 11:57 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So before proceeding with the session, are there any questions you would like to ask?
27/2/24, 1:31 PM - +263 77 709 8241: No
27/2/24, 2:10 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Are you clear on the same?
27/2/24, 2:24 PM - +263 77 709 8241: Yes
27/2/24, 2:42 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
27/2/24, 3:19 PM - +263 77 709 8241: Yess sure
27/2/24, 3:25 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $700 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on  February 29th, 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
