8/2/24, 1:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Praise 2K24JAN2552)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
8/2/24, 1:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Praise EWYL23E1272)* . In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
8/2/24, 1:40 PM - +263 77 473 2209: Thank you Ms Siddhi, my network is a bit erratic  but I will be following discussions as much as I can
8/2/24, 1:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand Praise. Thank you for letting me know about the same. Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
8/2/24, 1:49 PM - +263 78 789 9505: Quite clear ma'am
8/2/24, 1:50 PM - +263 78 789 9505: I'm ready we can start ma'am
8/2/24, 1:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
8/2/24, 1:53 PM - +263 78 789 9505: I'm done ma'am
8/2/24, 2:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
8/2/24, 2:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
8/2/24, 2:31 PM - +263 78 789 9505: They are clear ma'am
8/2/24, 3:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
8/2/24, 3:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
8/2/24, 3:24 PM - +263 78 789 9505: Yes yes I'm following all the steps ma'am
8/2/24, 3:27 PM - +263 78 789 9505: Ma'am can you explain this statement to me , Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.
8/2/24, 3:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the confusion caused from my end Praise. Please go through the following messages for your reference:
8/2/24, 3:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counselling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counselling session will take about 1 hour.
8/2/24, 3:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
8/2/24, 3:52 PM - +263 78 789 9505: It's okay ma'am
8/2/24, 3:54 PM - +263 78 789 9505: Okay I understand
8/2/24, 3:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
8/2/24, 3:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
8/2/24, 4:01 PM - +263 78 789 9505: What is the exact amount of registration fee?
8/2/24, 4:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The exact amount will depend on the university that provides you with an offer letter. For your reference, we have mentioned the range i.e., from $500 to $1000. Once you receive your offer letter, you will get to know the exact amount that you will have to pay as your registration amount. As we proceed with out discussions, you will gain more clarity on the same. In such a case, shall we proceed with our session today? <This message was edited>
8/2/24, 4:27 PM - +263 78 789 9505: Okay ma'am . It's now crystal clear
8/2/24, 4:27 PM - +263 78 789 9505: Yes we can proceed if your time permits you.
8/2/24, 4:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?

8/2/24, 5:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
8/2/24, 5:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?

9/2/24, 12:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Praise.

I hope you are all doing great today. Before we proceed with our session, I would like to check in on you and your family. How has your day been going so far?
9/2/24, 12:50 PM - +263 78 789 9505: Good afternoon ma'am
9/2/24, 12:52 PM - +263 78 789 9505: We are doing good ma'am . Thank you
9/2/24, 1:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. During our previous session, I had shared 4 videos containing messages from the founder's office. May I know if you were able to go through all of them and understand the intended message?
9/2/24, 1:38 PM - +263 78 789 9505: Yes I have gone through all the videos . I have understood the message.
9/2/24, 1:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that Praise. Could you kindly share your understanding of the videos with me?
9/2/24, 1:50 PM - +263 78 789 9505: Through voice notes or I have to type a message
9/2/24, 1:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You can share your understanding through voice notes or by typing as well, whichever is more feasible for you.
9/2/24, 2:04 PM - +263 78 789 9505: I have understood that there are two important messages for enrolled students which are students should be teachable and open minded and they have to follow Edoofa's instructions. 

I have also understood about the Statement of Purpose. It is the only subjective document that gives the opportunity for every student to convince the admission board or school.The SOP should not only include your goals but also your visions,your academic purposes and why you choose to study that particular course. It is an important document students should be prompt in taking action and be diligent in filling out the form.

The Edoofa's vision is to increase student's capacity for success thus making students more responsible and independent.
9/2/24, 2:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
9/2/24, 2:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of tomorrow.
9/2/24, 2:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
9/2/24, 2:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
9/2/24, 2:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose. I hope you were able to follow through with this?
9/2/24, 2:23 PM - +263 78 789 9505: Yes you can move forward and explain ma'am
9/2/24, 3:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Glad to hear that. Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow before our session.
9/2/24, 3:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

10/2/24, 12:19 PM - +263 78 789 9505: My apologies for not finishing in time ,I have been encountering  problems with our network this side
10/2/24, 1:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Praise.

I trust you are having a delightful weekend. On this pleasant Saturday afternoon, I hope you are presently available for a discussion. Before we begin, I would like to check in and ask how are things with you today?
10/2/24, 2:07 PM - +263 78 789 9505: Afternoon ma'am. We are all fine here. How are you?
10/2/24, 3:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am doing good too, thank you for asking. I understand that you were facing network challenges Praise. It is alright please. Thank you for sharing the answers and screenshot with me. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counselling on university admission*.
10/2/24, 3:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 3 March 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
10/2/24, 3:13 PM - +263 78 789 9505: Yes ma'am everything is in the right direction
10/2/24, 3:18 PM - +263 77 473 2209: Thank you Ms Siddhi for the reminder, everything is on track and the remaining balance will be paid in about 10 days time.
10/2/24, 3:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA (Travel and Tourism) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
10/2/24, 3:55 PM - +263 78 789 9505: Yes ma'am that is true I'm planning to arrive during August 2024
10/2/24, 4:02 PM - +263 78 789 9505: The information you have is correct. Thank you .
12/2/24, 8:08 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Praise.

I hope you had a wonderful weekend. Thank you for confirming that. Before we proceed with our session today, I would like to inquire, how are things on your end today?
12/2/24, 8:38 AM - +263 78 789 9505: Good morning ma'am. How are you? We are all fine. Thank you
12/2/24, 8:56 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that, Praise. I am doing well, thank you for asking. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
12/2/24, 8:56 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
12/2/24, 8:56 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
12/2/24, 8:56 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
12/2/24, 9:01 AM - +263 78 789 9505: Yes ma'am it's not possible to study at multiple universities
12/2/24, 9:26 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
12/2/24, 9:27 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalise their registration process.
12/2/24, 9:27 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counsellor has also discussed the registration fee during your counselling sessions, correct?
12/2/24, 9:30 AM - +263 78 789 9505: Yes ma'am we discussed about it .
12/2/24, 9:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
12/2/24, 9:36 AM - +263 78 789 9505: Yes ma'am we are
12/2/24, 9:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
12/2/24, 9:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*

Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
12/2/24, 9:46 AM - +263 78 789 9505: Yes ma'am i understand
12/2/24, 10:01 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
12/2/24, 10:01 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two instalments of $900 each. The initial instalment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly instalments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
12/2/24, 10:07 AM - +263 78 789 9505: Okay ma'am everything is clear
12/2/24, 10:08 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
12/2/24, 10:08 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
12/2/24, 10:08 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
12/2/24, 10:13 AM - +263 78 789 9505: Okay ma'am
12/2/24, 10:13 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.
12/2/24, 10:13 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
12/2/24, 10:14 AM - +263 78 789 9505: No ma'am I don't have any queries
12/2/24, 10:14 AM - +263 78 789 9505: Thank you
12/2/24, 10:17 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
12/2/24, 10:17 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
12/2/24, 10:17 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
12/2/24, 10:17 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/2/24, 10:21 AM - +263 78 789 9505: Very excited ma'am
12/2/24, 10:44 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, indeed Praise. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
12/2/24, 10:44 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavour for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
12/2/24, 10:50 AM - +263 78 789 9505: Yes ma'am I'm excited. You can tell
12/2/24, 10:58 AM - +263 78 789 9505: You can share
12/2/24, 11:23 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realised that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.
12/2/24, 11:23 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000. 

We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
12/2/24, 11:25 AM - +263 78 789 9505: Yes ma'am that's true
12/2/24, 11:31 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.

Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
12/2/24, 11:31 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for February 29, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by March 29 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
12/2/24, 11:31 AM - +263 78 789 9505: Not yet ,I'm waiting to hear the good news
12/2/24, 11:34 AM - +263 78 789 9505: No ma'am, everything is clear
12/2/24, 12:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
12/2/24, 12:43 PM - +263 78 789 9505: This message was deleted
12/2/24, 12:43 PM - +263 78 789 9505: No ma'am ,I dont have any queries
12/2/24, 1:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With this, we can proceed to step 4 of the admission cycle, i.e., *Offer Letter from University/College*. Are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
12/2/24, 1:30 PM - +263 78 789 9505: Ver excited ma'am
12/2/24, 1:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, dear. With this, we can proceed to step 4 of the admission cycle, i.e., Offer Letter from University/College. The universities will take three to five days to evaluate your application, after which, if they accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you a scholarship offer letter. In the offer letter, the scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee will be mentioned.
12/2/24, 1:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before I conclude today's conversation, I want to share something exciting with you.

5/3/24, 12:34 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Day Praise and family,

We at Edoofa are filled with energy and excitement which has been fueled by the successful meet and greet sessions we hosted at the Martin Luther King Family of Schools, Harare last week. 

The entire Edoofa Team returned from Zimbabwe with a wealth of learnings, experiences, and opportunities for our students. Even before the team returned to India, we were already eagerly planning our next visit, spurred on by the incredible connections and opportunities we secured for the students of Zimbabwe.
5/3/24, 12:34 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: However, before I get into our experiences and the opportunities that were provided to you and your family, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success. 

I am also eager to hear about your experience at the meet and greet session. Whom were you able to connect with, and how do you envision your educational journey progressing from here?
5/3/24, 1:02 PM - +263 78 789 9505: How are you? We are all fine .
5/3/24, 1:16 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I am doing well, Praise, thanks for asking!
5/3/24, 1:17 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: How was your experience at the recent Edoofa event at Harare?
5/3/24, 1:26 PM - +263 78 789 9505: The event was well organised,I was happy to meet with the founder of Edoofa Mr Angad and his team. I was also keen to meet Mr Keshav who was my councillor. I was very excited to see some students who are already there living the life of their dreams. They shared with us their experience with Edoofa. They said Edoofa is like a home to us.
5/3/24, 1:35 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: It's heartening to see how each student's journey unfolds, and our conversation today reaffirms the progress we've made as an organization with our students. Do you know how many students and parents attended the seminar over just three days?
5/3/24, 1:36 PM - +263 78 789 9505: I don't know

5/3/24, 1:38 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Praise, there were over 2700 attendees and out of these 2,700 attendees, our team had the privilege of engaging in 30-minute one-on-one sessions with 487 students, including Mr. Austin, Ms. Vilsha, Mr. Abhinav, Mr. Jyotishman, and Mr. Piyush and the director of Edoofa. As per the records that I have, it seems as if you were not able to meet the team for a one on one? If I may ask, may I know if there is any particular reason because of which you were not able to meet the team personally?
5/3/24, 2:05 PM - +263 78 789 9505: I didn't know there was going to be one -on-one session with the directors
5/3/24, 2:13 PM - +263 78 789 9505: This message was deleted
5/3/24, 2:14 PM - +263 78 789 9505: I was not aware of the pending one on one session ,I simply rushed home after the main session because there was transport situation that day .
5/3/24, 2:29 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I understand and I will guide you with the opportunities, Praise! Now, while I have a plethora of insights from the seminar to share with you, I recognize that we are already approaching March, with academic classes commencing in August. With this timeline in mind, I am keen to hear about your educational plans. Have you and your family been able to discuss your aspirations and next steps for your university education in the past couple of days?
5/3/24, 2:34 PM - +263 78 789 9505: Yes we have discussed.
5/3/24, 2:38 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: That is good, Among the positive seminar experiences, we encountered some sobering realities as well. We met students from the 2021 batch who, due to financial constraints, were unable to pursue their education in India as initially planned. They enrolled in local universities such as Chinhoyi University, Bindura University, University of Zimbabwe, and Harare Institute of Technology. However, upon meeting us, they expressed dissatisfaction with their current educational experiences and uncertain prospects for employment, despite substantial financial investments.
5/3/24, 2:39 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: These students revealed that they're paying $2400 at Chinhoyi University, $2600 at Bindura University, and $3200 at the University of Zimbabwe. Despite these hefty fees, they lack confidence in their future opportunities. This predicament underscores the importance of informed decision-making in education.
5/3/24, 2:39 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I recall our last visit to Zimbabwe in May 2023, where the exchange rate was 1000 Bonds to 1 USD. Now, in just 10 months, it has skyrocketed to 18000 Bonds. This steep rise significantly has impacted students studying in Zimbabwe, increasing the challenges they face. Were you aware of this exchange rate?
5/3/24, 2:41 PM - +263 78 789 9505: Yes ,I was aware of the exchange rate
5/3/24, 2:46 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I see Praise, and as you're aware, Zimbabwe presents its own set of challenges. Our team experienced firsthand the elevated cost of living and network difficulties, which contribute to the demand of pursuing education abroad. 

Additionally, there was a concerning safety incident involving our female staff members in Harare when they were followed by two men at night. While incidents like these serve as sobering reminders, they also highlight the importance of exploring educational opportunities in more stable environments.

What are your thoughts on these challenges, Name? Do you perceive them as common occurrences in Zimbabwe?
5/3/24, 2:56 PM - +263 78 789 9505: These challenges are definitely affecting the local education system. As a matter of fact, I came across an article in one of our local papers which said some of our local Polytechnic colleges are facing closure due to lack of infrastructure and skilled manpower. Our colleges are churning out graduates who are not fully equipped and ready for the market. Some of these unemployed graduates are the ones who end up engaging in crime because of economic challenges
5/3/24, 3:26 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: That is quite unfortunate Praise, and I personally wish for you to take a step forward from your current situation and get access to better opportunities. In the quest of doing the same, I had a discussion with the academic board and have been able to discuss some solutions for you and your family that can ensure you are able to pursue your education abroad this academic year.
5/3/24, 3:30 PM - +263 78 789 9505: I could appreciate that very much Sir, thank you.
5/3/24, 3:31 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: You are welcome, is your family prepared towards the registration fee payment to reserve your scholarship seat?
5/3/24, 3:33 PM - +263 78 789 9505: Yes Sir,they are well prepared
5/3/24, 3:46 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Noted Praise, so, when is your family planning to complete the registration fee payment?
5/3/24, 4:00 PM - +263 78 789 9505: The information we got from Edoofa is that, when we receive the offer letter from the university we will then know how much exactly we have to pay. From there we will choose one of the payment plans and start paying right away.
5/3/24, 4:25 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Indeed Praise, and inorder to recommend your application for a fastrack process for the Offer Letter, can you share a picture of your O level, A level and National ID
