This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.

26/1/24, 9:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Blessing,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa*. Recently I was having a discussion with the Academic Board. They highlighted  that you have not been able to proceed with your admission process in a timely manner, since your child is at school and you have been occupied with work. Hence, I pitched in that I will be able to help you out and take over your application profile so that together we can ensure a timely and smooth progress. Since my operational hours accommodate your timings more suitably, I will be assuming the duties of your admission officer. I am optimistic that together, we can pave the way for an auspicious beginning to your academic journey, resulting in the right career prospects and eventual success for both you and your family.
26/1/24, 9:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 9:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Today, on India's 75th Republic Day, I want to extend warm regards to you and your family! As we mark 75 years of freedom and democracy, my heart overflows with pride for our vibrant nation. Today, we celebrate the sacrifices of our forefathers, the strength of our unity, and the promise of a brighter tomorrow. Let's hold onto the spirit of this auspicious day, embracing the values that make India truly special.
26/1/24, 9:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: On this auspicious note, I would like to extend my heartiest regards to you and your family, and I hope that just like my proud nation, we will work unitedly and make progress in your admission process to ensure that you are able to realise your dream of pursuing higher education here in India. I would like to schedule our session for 10:30 AM tomorrow, so that we can discuss the progress and the next steps to be taken for your admission journey.
26/1/24, 9:33 PM - +263 77 581 7170: Thank you Sir Mr Singh. We are delighted you noted that well, we couldn't pay timely for Anesu Blessing. However, we raised the issue with Mr Austin and he directed us to Mr Gupta. The issue is, Anesu has a twin Sister Anodiwa Blessed Chaurura who has since gottwn a 100% scholarship at MSN UNIVERSITY beginning 1st of August 2024. Mr Gupta earlier on made a video call to me as Anesu's father and we spoke until we resolved to the effect that since we are struggling to pay Anodiwa's registration fees, it is better we shelve Anesu's application until we are fully paid for Anodiwa. That is the current  position Sir Singh.  If you may find out from the duo to confirm whT I've just explained above
26/1/24, 9:35 PM - +263 77 581 7170: Unfortunately am so sorry Sir tomorrow we won't be available.  We lost one of our beloved grandfather and tomorrow is his remains' burial day. We may be available at about the same time...from 7pm to 9pm
26/1/24, 9:50 PM - +263 71 291 4917: Is it fine if we may propose to meet here online from 1900 to 2100 tomorrow Sir??
27/1/24, 10:53 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Blessing. Thank you for sharing your concerns with me. I am so sorry for your loss, and I hope your grandfather rests in peace. I understand that this is a difficult time for you, and it is completely okay if you wish to have this day to yourself. We may reconnect on Monday for further discussion. Could you kindly let me know of 1 hour slot between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM during which you will be available to have our discussion comfortably?
27/1/24, 2:55 PM - +263 71 291 4917: Definitely we will do so. Thank you for your hospitality and accommodating us during this unfortunate period.  May the Lord God warrant you all that you need
27/1/24, 4:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your kind words and my prayers are with you and your family. Please take care during this difficult time. I will reconnect with you on Monday at 1:00 PM if that is suitable for you?
27/1/24, 5:06 PM - +263 77 581 7170: Yes I suggest we reconnect at 1pm to 2pm Sir.
27/1/24, 5:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. In such a case, we will conclude today's conversation and reconnect on Monday at 1:00 PM to further discuss the application process. Until then, please take care and my prayers are with you and your family during this difficult time.

29/1/24, 1:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Blessing. I hope you are all doing well. How has your day been going so far?
29/1/24, 1:14 PM - +263 71 291 4917: So fine Sir. We are ready to go on Sir Singh
29/1/24, 1:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that. I was going through Blessing's application profile and it is my understanding that you were being introduced to the admission cycle. May I know if I am correct?
29/1/24, 1:43 PM - +263 71 291 4917: Yes Sir you are correct. We made an initial deposit of 200usd to that effect
29/1/24, 2:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. Allow me to explain further on the same. Before we move forward, I would like to share the image representing university admission process again. Kindly let me know when you are done so I can explain the same to you in detail.
29/1/24, 2:10 PM - +263 77 581 7170: Go ahead Sir Singh
29/1/24, 2:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are conversing with Miss Singh, dear. I believe you have mistakenly addressed me as sir.
29/1/24, 2:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 2:44 PM - +263 77 581 7170: OK Madam.. Am sorry for addressing you as Sir. Let us go through the cycle and we will shortly come back to you around 1800hrs for continuation of discussions

29/1/24, 3:00 PM - +263 71 291 4917: Yes let's reconnect at 430pm sharp
29/1/24, 3:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well. Thank you for letting me know that. In such a case, I will reach out to you at 4:30 PM today.
29/1/24, 3:31 PM - +263 71 291 4917: Well Maam
29/1/24, 4:45 PM - +263 71 291 4917: Good evening ma'am. Hope you are fine. Can we continue. Anesu Blessing has gone through stages 1 to 3 where she was supposed to make payment of 350usd Enrollment fee after which she would be eligible to go for stage 4, receiving offer letters from Universities. However, we spoke with Mr  Austin and the Programs Director Mr Gupta Abhinav after I explained to them that I have two of them Anesu and Anodiwa who are twins. I had actually failed to pay up the 150usd out of the required 350usd for Anesu, and the 1000usd Registration fee required for Anodiwa who is now at stage 4, and had to pay 350usd  to reserve the seat at a university which had given her an offer letter. 

The twin girls both want to come to study in India this 1st week of August 2024. So we were faced with a serious dilemma until I presented it to Mr Austin. He then arranged for me to hold a video call meeting with the Programs Director and after a thorough interviews he agreed to give the twin girls a special provision to ensure that they both get assisted to pursue their carriers

29/1/24, 4:54 PM - +263 71 291 4917: Furthermore. MR Austin. In collaboration with the Programmes Director Mr Gupta then gave Anodiwa a special 100percent scholarship special grant. We received the offer letter from MVN University which now required us to pay 1000usd Registration Fees for Anodiwa by the end of February 2024 and to complete  payment of the outstanding 500usd fees for that special grant. We also conversed with Mr Austin who further indicated as per our kind request that both girls need to come at once in August 2024, to which Sir Austin agreed, saying that was now the present arrangement. Anesu Blessing Chaurura and Anodiwa Blessed Chaurura will now come to MVN University in the first week of August 2024. WhT may be outstanding now is completion  of Anesus paperwork to be at the same level with Anodiwa. Maam, are we now on the same page Ms Singh.
29/1/24, 5:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand sir. Thank you for explaining your situation to me. I understand that you have been conversing with Mr. Austin and Mr. Abhinav regarding your situation about the admission process. I will reach out to Mr. Austin and ask him to reconnect with you in order to further make progress in your application process. I hope this will be helpful sir?
29/1/24, 5:34 PM - +263 71 291 4917: Very much madam. Am so delighted for your hospitality and kindness. Please do. And give Him the entire rewinding of the situation so that we secure Anes's offer letter, as per our last discussion

29/1/24, 5:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand. Rest assured, I will let him know about our discussion so that you are able to proceed smoothly from this point onwards. Thank you for your kind words sir. I had a nice time interacting with you. I wish you a blessed week ahead and kindly extend my regards to your family as well!
