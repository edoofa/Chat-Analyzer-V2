I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am *Mr. Dev Kumar, the Admission Officer* at Edoofa. Alongside *Ms. Vilsha, Head of Admissions* at Edoofa, I am thrilled to be a part of your university admission journey.

I am sure you must be aware that recently we had hosted the meet and greet sessions at the Martin Luther King Family of Schools, Harare last week. The entire Edoofa Team returned from Zimbabwe with a wealth of learnings, experiences, and opportunities for our students. I am excited to share some highlights from the event with you.
