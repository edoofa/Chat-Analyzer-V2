4/3/24, 9:31 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Since this is the first time we are interacting with each other, I'm eager to learn more about you. Could you kindly provide an introduction of yourself and also share details about your family, sponsor, or guardians who will play a role in shaping your educational plans?
4/3/24, 9:53 AM - +263 71 771 3324: Sure sirI would be delighted to

My name is Aspire Pondwa. I am a teenage boy who aspires to become a software engineer. I grew up in Chitungwiza with my mother, who cared for me and my five siblings. Despite the many challenges she faced, she always found a way to pay my school fees at Zengeza 1 High School. My mother is my inspiration, my guardian, and my sponsor. Without her, I would not be where I am today. She will play an important role in shaping my educational plans and my future.
4/3/24, 10:03 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about yourself, Aspire. I must truly commend your mother's hard work in supporting you and your siblings despite the many challenges she faced. I believe you are a sincere student and I truly believe you are going to make your mother proud with your achievements in the future.
4/3/24, 10:23 AM - +263 71 771 3324: Yes Sir, I am determined to. Thank you sir.
4/3/24, 10:23 AM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome. Since this is your admissions group, I believe you must have added your mother to the group. This will help them become familiar with the admission process and enable her to participate when required. Could you please confirm if she has already been added to the group? <This message was edited>
4/3/24, 10:25 AM - +263 71 771 3324: Yes she is in the group.
4/3/24, 10:25 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for this confirmation! Moving forward, I would like to bring an important aspect to your attention. The collective aim that we have for the student strongly values balanced involvement from parents, especially when the student is unable to participate. Your proactive engagement holds significant weight, and if, for any reason, either you or your guardians won't be available, we kindly request you to inform us beforehand so that we can plan and schedule our discussion beforehand. I hope you have taken note of this as well?
4/3/24, 10:33 AM - +263 71 771 3324: Yes, we will let you know when we are unavailable.
4/3/24, 10:33 AM - Dev Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
4/3/24, 10:34 AM - Dev Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *Aspire 2K24FEB2055*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
4/3/24, 10:34 AM - Dev Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *Aspire EWYL23E1344* . In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
4/3/24, 10:36 AM - +263 71 771 3324: Noted.
4/3/24, 10:36 AM - +263 71 771 3324: Yes I am clear.
4/3/24, 10:36 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
4/3/24, 10:37 AM - +263 71 771 3324: Yes, please do.
4/3/24, 10:37 AM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
4/3/24, 10:41 AM - +263 71 771 3324: Ok, i have gone through the process.
4/3/24, 10:42 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
4/3/24, 10:42 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
4/3/24, 10:48 AM - +263 71 771 3324: Yes, very clear.
4/3/24, 10:50 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps - 

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
4/3/24, 10:50 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
4/3/24, 10:54 AM - +263 71 771 3324: Yes, i'm following.
4/3/24, 10:54 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
4/3/24, 10:54 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
4/3/24, 10:58 AM - +263 71 771 3324: Yes, quite Vivid. Thank you for explaining Sir.
4/3/24, 10:58 AM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome. I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
4/3/24, 11:00 AM - +263 71 771 3324: Ofcourse.
4/3/24, 11:00 AM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
4/3/24, 11:00 AM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
4/3/24, 11:05 AM - +263 71 377 6677: How are you Mr Dev sorry to interrupt you bt l just want to know the due date for the amount to be paid
4/3/24, 11:05 AM - +263 71 771 3324: Yes, you may proceed.
4/3/24, 11:16 AM - +263 71 771 3324: She is referring to *Step 5*.
4/3/24, 11:18 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am doing absolutely fine @263713776677. No worries. The registration fee of $500-$1000 needs to be paid after 15 days of the issuance of the offer letter from the university. The admission process starts during the month of August. But since Aspire has taken an early step to enroll in the admission process, we, at Edoofa, are going to help you as a family to prepare the finances for the registration fee and make sure that you do not face any kind of difficulty in the admission process.
I hope I was able to clear your query?
4/3/24, 11:22 AM - +263 71 377 6677: Thank you so much Mr Dev
4/3/24, 11:23 AM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome! Let us proceed with the videos, 

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

4/3/24, 11:24 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
4/3/24, 11:24 AM - Dev Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection.
4/3/24, 11:24 AM - Dev Edoofa: Please go through the 4 videos, and let me know whenever you are done with the same.
4/3/24, 11:33 AM - +263 71 771 3324: Ok Sir, I will go through them but unfortunately I'm not on a smooth Internet connection. I am using data bundles which are limited. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
4/3/24, 11:50 AM - Dev Edoofa: I understand, Aspire. No need to worry. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 10:30 AM for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to go through the videos. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed day ahead and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
4/3/24, 11:53 AM - +263 71 771 3324: Ok thank you for understanding Sir.

5/3/24, 10:48 AM - Dev Edoofa: Greetings to you too @263713776677!
5/3/24, 10:59 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am hoping for a response to this question.
5/3/24, 11:09 AM - +263 71 771 3324: From the *first video*, I understood that learners should be teachable and open minded when it comes to education.

From the *Second video*, I undersrood that Edoofa is not only there to provide affordable high quality education but is also there to guide students to success and to make them employable through the EWYL program.

From the *third video*, I understood that Edoofa has invested 10 years to identify good schools, colleges and universities.  The founders encourage students to follow instructions so as to prepare them for these institutes.

From the *last video*, I understood that  I, the student,  should be prompt in taking action, and filling the statement of purpose with diligence.
5/3/24, 11:10 AM - Dev Edoofa: Brilliant, Aspire. I must commend your understanding of the 4 videos. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose. I hope you were able to follow through with this?
5/3/24, 11:13 AM - +263 71 771 3324: Yes,
5/3/24, 11:14 AM - Dev Edoofa: Glad to hear that. Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow before our session.
5/3/24, 11:14 AM - Dev Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
