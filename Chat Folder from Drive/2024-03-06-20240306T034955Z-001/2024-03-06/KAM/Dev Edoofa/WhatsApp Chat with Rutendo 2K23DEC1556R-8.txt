I hope all of you are doing great. While I was wrapping up my day, I observed that we were not able to have a smooth discussion for the past couple of days, which has led to some delay in the admission process. We are aware of your immense trust in us and we surely care about your future. Considering that in mind, I wanted to schedule a specific session tomorrow at 8:30 am so that we can cover the process we are lagging behind,  and ensure that your admission process is on track. I am aware that Rutendo is now at school. Hence, I wanted to understand if you as parents/guardians will be available for our session at 8:30am. If not, I would like you to please let me know at what time between 8:30 am to 4 pm will you be available?

9/1/24, 10:15 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!  First and foremost, allow me to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family for making the wonderful decision to enroll in the Edoofa program.

Could you kindly provide an introduction of hers and also share details about your family, sponsor, or guardians who will play a role in shaping Rutendo's educational plans?
9/1/24, 12:38 PM - +263 77 386 0303: Rutendo Bongozozo a young lady aged   17 years currently doing A levels studies at Loreto High School
Rutendo is born in a family 2,

9/1/24, 3:29 PM - +263 77 386 0303: Hello
9/1/24, 8:02 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Rutendo.

I hope all of you are having a wonderful day. Today I had a meeting with the academic board and I was discussing the current status of your application file and in the same discussion, the team higjlighted that we have been a bit off track for the discusisons we were suppsed to completed and hence I wanted to reach out to you and just reiteratre the agenda of the sessions/discusisons we have in place.
9/1/24, 8:02 PM - Dev Edoofa: The agenda for these sessions is to help you understand the process Rutendo will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since Rutendo is in school and you are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well. <This message was edited>
9/1/24, 8:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see, our goal is to help you prepare for your child's education abroad, that is something that is going to require a significant time. It requires months of planning. Hence, to do that perfectly and be prepared, as a parent, you would have to contribute an hour daily for at least 10 days so that we can be in sync and make the right decisions.
9/1/24, 8:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: We, at Edoofa, are determined to provide affordable higher education to hardworking students and assist them in launching their careers to greater heights. We will be able to help you only if we can connect timely and have healthy discussions.
9/1/24, 8:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January]. This way, we can align it with our availability as well and help you move forward and make progress in a streamlined manner. Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your inputs and find the right time for our sessions.
10/1/24, 8:31 AM - +263 77 386 0303: Good morning for today we can start but going forward her mother will tell yu  the time she can avail  her  self

I hope you are doing well. I have taken note of the timings that you have shared with us. Kindly provide me some time to reschedule the sessions and give you the confirmation accordingly. I hope you understand?
12/1/24, 2:34 PM - Dev Edoofa: Till then with great excitement and pride, I want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
12/1/24, 2:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experience. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
12/1/24, 2:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we start our session today, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

29/1/24, 9:48 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263773860303 and  @263712355969!
I hope you are doing well and have a great weekend. Thank you for sharing the form and I have taken complete note of it as well. May I know if you are ready to take forward Rutendo's admission journey?
29/1/24, 12:15 PM - +263 71 235 5969: Yes
29/1/24, 12:34 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
29/1/24, 12:36 PM - +263 71 235 5969: Yes we can proceed with the session
29/1/24, 12:43 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 12:44 PM - +263 71 235 5969: Oky u can explain
29/1/24, 12:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
29/1/24, 12:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
29/1/24, 12:48 PM - +263 71 235 5969: Yes can proceed
29/1/24, 12:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps - 

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
29/1/24, 12:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
29/1/24, 12:53 PM - +263 71 235 5969: Noted
29/1/24, 12:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
29/1/24, 12:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
29/1/24, 12:58 PM - +263 71 235 5969: Quite clear thank u
29/1/24, 12:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
29/1/24, 1:00 PM - +263 71 235 5969: Oky let's proceed
29/1/24, 1:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
29/1/24, 1:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
29/1/24, 1:07 PM - +263 71 235 5969: Oky
29/1/24, 1:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
29/1/24, 1:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait that distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
29/1/24, 1:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
29/1/24, 1:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
29/1/24, 1:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. I would recommend you to watch the videos now, so that we can reconnect after you have watched the videos and share your understanding of these, and we can move forward. May I know if you are clear with this?
29/1/24, 1:13 PM - +263 71 235 5969: Unfortunately I dont have internet connection only WhatsApp bundle
29/1/24, 1:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: Okay, let me share with you the downloaded videos here only, so as to ensure that you can watch the videos on Whatsapp only.

I hope you are doing well. I was expecting a response from your end yesterday and hence I wanted to reach out to you once again and see if we are still connected. 

At the same time, I was going through your application file and as per the same, you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of the Edoofa Enrollment fee of $150 before 27 January 2024. 

In light of this, I wanted to reach out to you, share a gentle reminder, and try to understand if you have been able to make the payment of your fee by now so that we can update the academic board accordingly?

This event holds a special place in our hearts as it brings us closer to our community, and we're counting down the days with great anticipation!
7/2/24, 9:29 AM - Dev Edoofa: Just like clockwork, we're gearing up for the seminar next week, and I couldn't resist sharing our enthusiasm with you. Your presence would truly make the event all the more meaningful, guiding you on your journey to India. Hence, with immense joy, we wanted to extend the special invitation for the Meet and Greet Seminar to you and your wonderful family.
7/2/24, 9:29 AM - Dev Edoofa: And in the process of doing the same, I happened to notice that you haven't started your EWYL Program by now. In light of this, I had a discussion with Ms. Sanjana, the head of the EWYL Department, and I am happy to share that she has graciously agreed to make a special exception for you, expediting your application process.
7/2/24, 9:29 AM - Dev Edoofa: As a result, I have gone ahead and created your very own dedicated EWYL Group - Rutendo EWYL23E1117, adding both you and your parents to the mix. If I have missed including any other family members, they can easily join using the following link: [https://chat.whatsapp.com/CCfsYtonhgU2J6f1qmhVaS].

7/2/24, 1:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263773860303 @263783698209!
I hope you are doing well. May I know if you are available to take forward our conversation as we are already lagging behind in the timelines related to Rutendo's admission journey?
7/2/24, 3:50 PM - +263 77 386 0303: Yes we can go ahead
7/2/24, 3:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! May I know if you were able to watch the videos that were shared with you?

8/2/24, 10:17 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning @263773860303 @263783698209!
I hope you are doing well. I am glad to hear that you were able to watch the videos yesterday. May I please get to know your understanding of each of the four videos?
8/2/24, 10:38 AM - +263 77 386 0303: I did not quite  understand  them i will  ask Munashe to explain  to me in our  mother language
9/2/24, 10:41 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning @263773860303!
I hope you are doing well. May I know if you were able to understand the 4 videos that were shared with you?
9/2/24, 6:54 PM - +263 78 369 8209: I have understood the videos sir we can proceed as I try and explain to my parents in our mother language
10/2/24, 2:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: Brilliant. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
10/2/24, 2:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move Rutendo's application ahead and help Rutendo write a proper statement of purpose so that she can get into the best University that provides quality education that leads to a Job. So, for the team to work on Rutendo's application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, we would require Rutendo's availability for approximately 30 minutes. If she is unavailable, she can provide you with her input, and you can proceed with the statement of purpose on her behalf.
10/2/24, 2:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in Rutendo's admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
10/2/24, 3:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit Rutendo's responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure to share her inputs and that she has researched well before starting the task. All the best!
10/2/24, 3:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/2/24, 3:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/2/24, 3:02 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once you share these documents and complete the two tasks that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan.
12/2/24, 8:18 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning @263773860303 @263783698209!
I hope you are doing well and had a wonderful start to the day. May I know if you were able to connect with Rutendo to get her responses to the Statement of Purpose and questions on the document? It is important complete these tasks to move forward with the process <This message was edited>
12/2/24, 8:36 AM - +263 71 235 5969: I will to school on the 2nd of March then she. will connect to you at school they are not allowed to use phones
12/2/24, 8:53 AM - Dev Edoofa: I understand, @263712355969, that Rutendo is at school and is not available. I discussed it with my team and we can allow ourselves to move forward with Rutendo's admission journey and complete this step when Rutendo is available to complete this step. So, may I know if you are available to take forward our conversation?
12/2/24, 1:45 PM - +263 77 386 0303: Yes we can move  forward
12/2/24, 1:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! With this, Let us progress to the third step in Rutendo's admission journey, i.e. *Introduction to Financial Secure Plan*.
12/2/24, 1:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course Rutendo has selected for her higher education is BA (Sociology) and it's my understanding that she is planning to arrive in India in August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate? <This message was edited>
12/2/24, 1:54 PM - +263 77 386 0303: Yes its very  accurate
12/2/24, 1:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
12/2/24, 1:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
12/2/24, 1:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
12/2/24, 2:00 PM - +263 77 386 0303: That is very true  you can hear  us how' it is done
12/2/24, 2:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
12/2/24, 2:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
12/2/24, 2:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
12/2/24, 2:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
12/2/24, 2:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
12/2/24, 2:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
12/2/24, 2:48 PM - +263 77 386 0303: Yes i have  seen  it so what  are the plan may i know
12/2/24, 2:53 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Let me explain it to you. As you are aware, we are currently in February 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
12/2/24, 2:53 PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
12/2/24, 2:53 PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
12/2/24, 6:55 PM - +263 77 386 0303: Glad to hear  that but i Want  to know  is it possible   that you can deposit  the money  to the university
13/2/24, 7:54 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning @263773860303!
I hope you are doing well. I was not able to answer your query yesterday, as our operational hours were over at the time you replied. Now, may I please ask you to please elaborate a little on the above query as I was not able to understand it clearly?
13/2/24, 9:37 AM - +263 71 235 5969: He was trying to say is they no account for university  to deposit the fees direct
13/2/24, 9:50 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for making me understand, @263712355969! You can surely do that, but you will not be able to reap the benefits of the Edoofa Secure Plan. May I please ask you to allow me to explain to you all the benefits of the Plan and how it works?
13/2/24, 10:09 AM - +263 77 386 0303: Yes you can go ahead
13/2/24, 10:10 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! Now, picking up our conversation from here. Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
13/2/24, 10:10 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
13/2/24, 10:10 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
13/2/24, 10:11 AM - +263 71 235 5969: Understand so the per we are paying it's going Edoofa SecurePlan
13/2/24, 10:11 AM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, @263712355969! That is correct. This plan is going to help you only to prepare your finances and reduce the burden of making a large payment. <This message was edited>
13/2/24, 10:12 AM - Dev Edoofa: May I know if you are able to see this perspective?
13/2/24, 10:13 AM - +263 71 235 5969: Oky l understand
13/2/24, 10:13 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
13/2/24, 10:14 AM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
13/2/24, 10:14 AM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
13/2/24, 10:14 AM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
13/2/24, 10:16 AM - +263 71 235 5969: I only want know what mostly wanted to plan about journey  like aeroplane  cost
13/2/24, 10:21 AM - Dev Edoofa: We will surely get to that part as it is also covered in the Plan. Till that time, I would like you to kindly be patient and please try to understand that entwining information can create confusion, which is going to be non-beneficial for both of us. I hope you understand?
13/2/24, 10:22 AM - +263 71 235 5969: Noted
13/2/24, 10:22 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to hear. Considering the above mentioned constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
13/2/24, 10:33 AM - +263 71 235 5969: Yes Sir
13/2/24, 10:33 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500.
13/2/24, 10:34 AM - Dev Edoofa: That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive $150 from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
13/2/24, 10:34 AM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
13/2/24, 11:14 AM - Dev Edoofa: Are you still available @263712355969 @263773860303?
13/2/24, 1:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am waiting for a response @263712355969 @263773860303.
13/2/24, 1:24 PM - +263 71 235 5969: Edoofa its good
13/2/24, 2:09 PM - +263 77 386 0303: Yes i am
13/2/24, 2:09 PM - +263 77 386 0303: Network is bad here

1/3/24, 1:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Rutendo!
I hope you are having a wonderful start to the day.
I was a bit under the weather for a few days due to which I took some days off to recover. Now, I am doing absolutely fine.
1/3/24, 1:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: May I know how are you all doing?
1/3/24, 3:51 PM - +263 71 235 5969: We are fine sir
2/3/24, 8:31 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! We at Edoofa are filled with energy and excitement which has been fueled by the successful meet and greet sessions we hosted at the Martin Luther King Family of Schools, Harare last week. 

The entire Edoofa Team returned from Zimbabwe with a wealth of learnings, experiences, and opportunities for our students. Before I get into our experiences and the opportunities we were able to secure for our students, I wanted to check in and see if you were able to attend the seminar?
4/3/24, 4:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: I was hoping for a response from your side.
