This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
4/3/24, 9:34 AM - +263 77 245 6229: Noted
4/3/24, 9:35 AM - Dev Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *Shalom EWYL23E1313* . In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
4/3/24, 9:37 AM - +263 77 245 6229: Well understood
4/3/24, 9:39 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
4/3/24, 9:41 AM - +263 77 245 6229: Let's start.  I am  following
4/3/24, 9:43 AM - +263 71 724 6985: Let's start
4/3/24, 9:47 AM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
4/3/24, 9:49 AM - +263 77 245 6229: Am done
4/3/24, 9:49 AM - +263 71 724 6985: Me too
4/3/24, 9:49 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
4/3/24, 9:49 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
4/3/24, 9:53 AM - +263 71 724 6985: Who comes up with this statement of purpose. Is it Edoofa or Shalom
4/3/24, 9:56 AM - +263 77 245 6229: Shalom  i think
4/3/24, 9:56 AM - Dev Edoofa: We will need Shalom's inputs for preparing Shalom's Statement of Purpose.
4/3/24, 9:57 AM - +263 77 245 6229: Understood
4/3/24, 9:58 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps - 

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
4/3/24, 9:58 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
4/3/24, 10:00 AM - +263 77 245 6229: Ww are following
4/3/24, 10:03 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
4/3/24, 10:03 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
4/3/24, 10:05 AM - +263 77 245 6229: Very clear
4/3/24, 10:05 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
4/3/24, 10:07 AM - +263 77 245 6229: Proceed
4/3/24, 10:08 AM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
4/3/24, 10:08 AM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
4/3/24, 10:11 AM - +263 77 245 6229: Share
4/3/24, 10:12 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

5/3/24, 10:34 AM - +263 77 245 6229: We went  through
5/3/24, 10:35 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! May I please get to know your understanding of each of the 4 videos that were shared with you?
5/3/24, 10:39 AM - +263 77 245 6229: Shalom  is still  at school.  Her sister is joining you now.  I am  a bit occupied  with  work  at the  moment.  Might  need  some 30 minutes
5/3/24, 10:41 AM - Dev Edoofa: I understand you may take your time to share your understanding of the videos. Till then we can move ahead to the next step in the admission cycle. What do you think about it?
5/3/24, 10:42 AM - +263 77 245 6229: It's alright
5/3/24, 10:42 AM - Dev Edoofa: Glad to hear that. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
5/3/24, 10:43 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move Shalom's application ahead and help Shalom write a proper statement of purpose so that he/she can get into the best University that provides quality education that leads to a Job. So, for the team to work on Shalom's application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, we would require Shalom's availability for approximately 30 minutes. If she is unavailable, she can provide you with her input, and you can proceed with the statement of purpose on her behalf.
5/3/24, 10:44 AM - Dev Edoofa: 1. I am sure you have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in Shalom's admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.
