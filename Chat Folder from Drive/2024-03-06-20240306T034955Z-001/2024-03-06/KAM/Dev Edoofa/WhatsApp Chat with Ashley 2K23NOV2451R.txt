22/1/24, 5:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
22/1/24, 5:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
22/1/24, 5:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
22/1/24, 5:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
22/1/24, 5:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
22/1/24, 5:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
22/1/24, 5:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: I hope these steps are clear to you?
22/1/24, 7:03 PM - +263 77 263 2746: Very clear
22/1/24, 9:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Since our operational hours were over at the time you replied, I was not able to take forward the conversation, we will take forward our conversation at 12:30 PM tomorrow. Till then I wish you a blessed night!

23/1/24, 12:40 PM - +263 77 263 2746: Is what we doing all along amongst the 6 stages???
23/1/24, 12:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: May I please ask you to elaborate on your query? I am not able to understand what you are trying to convey.
23/1/24, 12:53 PM - +263 77 263 2746: The six stages you explained. Have we covered any stage or we are going to discuss more of them next sessions
23/1/24, 12:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thanks for elaborating on your query @263772632746. We will start with the first step in today's session.

23/1/24, 1:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
23/1/24, 1:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?

23/1/24, 1:53 PM - Dev Edoofa: @263772632746 , I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding.
23/1/24, 1:53 PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 12:30 pm for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to go through the videos. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed day ahead and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
24/1/24, 1:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263772632746!
I hope you are doing well. We have our session right now. May I know if you have watched the videos that were shared with you?
24/1/24, 1:19 PM - +263 77 263 2746: Have watched them
24/1/24, 1:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! May I know if you can share your understanding of the 4 videos?
24/1/24, 3:06 PM - +263 77 263 2746: Edoofa has put check points to identify good schools in India that doesn't steal from international students. Also the SOP help to display why you were chosen to be an edoofian and why University has to enroll you
24/1/24, 3:10 PM - +263 77 263 2746: Sorry for the delay was traveling with work and has lost internet
25/1/24, 1:25 PM - +263 77 263 2746: Good afternoon
26/1/24, 8:56 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning @263772632746 and Ashley!
I hope you are doing well and are having a wonderful start to the day. I felt a bit under the weather yesterday, so I took a day off to focus on my health. Today, I am feeling better and completely ready to take our conversation forward. I completely understand the network challenges you were facing. Thank you for sharing your understanding of the videos. <This message was edited>
26/1/24, 8:57 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
26/1/24, 9:00 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move Ashley's application ahead and help Ashley write a proper statement of purpose so that he can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on Ashley's application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, we would require Ashley's availability for approximately 30 minutes. If he is unavailable, he can provide you with his input, and you can proceed with the statement of purpose on his behalf.
26/1/24, 9:00 AM - Dev Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in Ashley's admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
26/1/24, 9:01 AM - Dev Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit Ashley’s responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure to share his inputs and research well before starting the task. All the best!
26/1/24, 9:03 AM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 9:03 AM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 9:03 AM - Dev Edoofa: Once you share these documents and complete the two tasks that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process.
26/1/24, 9:03 AM - Dev Edoofa: May I know when these tasks will be completed?
26/1/24, 9:28 AM - +263 77 263 2746: Good morning
26/1/24, 9:41 AM - +263 77 263 2746: Will update his availability on Saturday and Share his input by Monday
26/1/24, 12:03 PM - +263 77 263 2746: 29 March 2024
26/1/24, 12:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: May I please ask you to explain this date as I am unable to understand what is it for?
26/1/24, 12:05 PM - +263 77 263 2746: We will submit Ashley response on Monday 29 January 2024
26/1/24, 12:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know but may I please ask you to fill out the form and provide the answers on the document by tomorrow? This is because it will only take Ashley 30 minutes to complete both tasks and we are already lagging behind in the process, so I would recommend you to complete these tasks on an urgent basis. I hope you understand my concern?
26/1/24, 12:14 PM - +263 77 263 2746: Noted will engage the school authority to assist
26/1/24, 12:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know!
27/1/24, 7:24 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning @263772632746 !
I hope you are doing well. May I know what is the update on the above tasks?
27/1/24, 8:03 AM - +263 77 263 2746: Good morning. Will update by 10 am .
27/1/24, 8:08 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thanks for letting me know.
27/1/24, 12:38 PM - +263 77 263 2746: Managed to contact Ashley. He is working on the response to submit today
27/1/24, 12:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thanks for informing!
27/1/24, 1:36 PM - +263 77 263 2746: <Media omitted>
27/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 77 263 2746: I believe my country has a lot of infrastructure that is going to waste because it lacks the personel which is capable of using it therefore it is subject to hiring foreigners who cost the country money and develop back in their own countries
 I see my country developing a lot in the coming years and I wish to be a part of that development
With my career I will be able to eliminate the cost of hiring foreigners and I will be able to give my  fellow Zimbabweans quality services . Development is bound to happen if the citizens are happy
  I do believe that ,my career and I will be a beacon of inspiration to the others,  it will show others that you do not have to go to a foreign country for a job but instead choose to develop your country until it has reached the standards you desire out of it 
It is my  belief aso that, my career will be a major factor in the development of my country
27/1/24, 2:11 PM - +263 71 881 3922: 3. My desire is to work under the main Electricity distribution company in Zimbabwe ( Zimbabwe Electrical Transmission and Distribution Company - ZETDC).

ZETDC focuses on manufacturing, operations, installation and maintanance of the electrical systems in my Country.
I wish to work for Zesa because it will solve the problem of personel shortage and as someone who would have studied in a different country ( a developed one ) I will bring more experience , further improving the services within my country. 
As I said I may have personal goals such as taking care of my family but as a citizen I also wish to see my country developing because there's no point of taking care of people in a country with poor living standards.
I will add scientific advancements to the power supply company. 

My career will help the company address problems directly and find practical solutions by determining when machines and parts need to be replaced and the costs of doing so.
27/1/24, 2:26 PM - +263 71 881 3922: Electronics is the art of creating and manipulating electronic devices such as electronic devices like TV’s, computers, and smartphones and it is mainly focused with the flow of electrons. On the other hand, electrical systems are systems that deal with the study and the use of  electric current these are systems that use the concept of electromagnetism in various ways and it can be summed up that these systems are dependent on the flow of power and charge rather than electrons only  .I believe if there is a mention of electricity as energy then we are talking about electrical systems because electrical systems just use the electricity as energy that helps them achieve their intended purpose and there is no manipulation of the electricity into other forms but if there is a clear mention of the manipulation of that electrical energy ( which is done in phones and televisions which convert the electricity to other form s) then that is electronics
27/1/24, 2:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you @263772632746 and @263718813922 for sharing the answers to the document. However, one question is left and the Statement of purpose form also needs to be filled.
27/1/24, 2:49 PM - +263 77 263 2746: He is facing netwrk challenges
27/1/24, 2:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thanks for letting me know. I understand the network challenges that he is facing.
27/1/24, 3:05 PM - +263 71 881 3922: A capacitor is a device that has the ability to store charge it is made up of two parallel metal plates that are separated by an insulator known as a dielectric.this insulator could be a different object such as wax ,paper,mica ceramic etc.when a capacitor is connected to a power supply electrons flow from the negative terminal to one of the plates making it negatively charged and electrons are also lost to the power supply by the other plate giving it a net positive charge this creates a potential difference between the two plates this potential difference .the  charge is then distributed evenly on the surface of the plates and stored there ready to be released when needed ( they are found in Electrical systems that use alternating current so they release charge when the current is going in a direction as opposed to the desired which ensures that components that are connected continue working). Capacitance is the ability to store charge and for capacitors it depends on the area of the plates and their separation distance and the type of dielectric.the larger the area the greater the capacitance and the smaller the separation distance of the plates the greater the capacitance
27/1/24, 3:54 PM - +263 77 263 2746: <Media omitted>
27/1/24, 3:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you so much for providing the responses to the form and and screenshot of the SOP form. I have taken a note of it adn will update them in our records aswell.
27/1/24, 3:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: May I know if you are available for a session?
27/1/24, 4:02 PM - +263 77 263 2746: Yes I am on network for the next 30minutes
27/1/24, 4:02 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thanks for letting me know.
27/1/24, 4:02 PM - Dev Edoofa: With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
27/1/24, 4:03 PM - +263 77 263 2746: We can proceed
27/1/24, 4:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course Ahley has selected for his higher education is B.Tech (Electrical Engineering) and it's my understanding that he is planning to arrive in India in August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
27/1/24, 4:05 PM - +263 77 263 2746: That is correct
27/1/24, 4:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
27/1/24, 4:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
27/1/24, 4:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
27/1/24, 4:07 PM - +263 77 263 2746: Yes,  you can elaborate
27/1/24, 4:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
27/1/24, 4:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
27/1/24, 4:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
27/1/24, 4:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
27/1/24, 4:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
27/1/24, 4:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
27/1/24, 4:11 PM - +263 77 263 2746: This is good and I wish to have it
27/1/24, 4:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
27/1/24, 4:13 PM - +263 77 263 2746: Yes
27/1/24, 4:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
27/1/24, 4:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
27/1/24, 4:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
27/1/24, 4:18 PM - +263 77 263 2746: I do agree
27/1/24, 4:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
27/1/24, 4:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
27/1/24, 4:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
27/1/24, 4:22 PM - +263 77 263 2746: Is this subtraction from the 3000 or its adding to the 3000
27/1/24, 4:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: It is totally a scenario for savings for the fee structure of $3000. The Edoofa Secure plan is for savings and better preparation of finances for student's higher education.
27/1/24, 4:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: You will soon understand about it later in the session.
27/1/24, 4:26 PM - +263 77 263 2746: Yes I see it
27/1/24, 4:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
27/1/24, 4:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
27/1/24, 4:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
27/1/24, 4:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
27/1/24, 4:27 PM - +263 77 263 2746: Yes very right
27/1/24, 4:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
27/1/24, 4:29 PM - +263 77 263 2746: Yes go ahead
27/1/24, 4:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350.
27/1/24, 4:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500.
27/1/24, 4:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
27/1/24, 7:07 PM - +263 77 263 2746: Starting which month
27/1/24, 9:03 PM - +263 77 263 2746: Because as it and as you mentioned life in Zimbabwe is tough. Currently am raising $400 for their secondary education Ashley and his brother so for 2024 I can't manage raising extra 150 a month until Ashley is done with his advanced level. Meaning I will be free from November 2024 going forward
29/1/24, 11:23 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning @263772632746!
I hope you are doing well and had a wonderful weekend! Since you replied when our operational hours were over for the day, I was not able to attend to your query. Thank you for letting me know about your financial condition for the next few months. However, I would recommend you allow me further to explain the plan and its aspects in detail, so that everything is clear and you can take a decision accordingly. So, may I know if we can move forward?
29/1/24, 11:28 AM - +263 77 263 2746: Explain further
29/1/24, 11:30 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! May I know if such a question was raised in your mind, when you go through the above messages?
29/1/24, 11:47 AM - +263 77 263 2746: Yes
29/1/24, 11:53 AM - Dev Edoofa: Great! If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
29/1/24, 11:53 AM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
29/1/24, 11:53 AM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
29/1/24, 11:53 AM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
29/1/24, 2:58 PM - +263 77 263 2746: It's all good but according to our financial strength we can only start payments after November 2023. We can as well make payments to meet the tenth month target
30/1/24, 10:33 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning @263772632746!
I hope you are doing well. I was not able to reply to you yesterday as I had to be in an urgent meeting. Before clearing out your query I want to inform you that admissions intake in the universities for the year 2025 is going to commence in August 2024 and over in November 2024. Now, if you wish to start the plan in November 2024, then there is no point in the plan, as the admissions are already going to be over. 

I understand that you are having trouble managing your finances right now, but during the admission intake in August, if you fail to prepare for the registration fees at that time, then Ashley may miss out on the golden opportunity to jumpstart his career and fulfill his dream of becoming an electrical engineer. That is why the Edoofa Secure Plan ensures that students can come to India, and do not face any financial constraints in doing so.
30/1/24, 10:34 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now may I please what challenges are you facing currently with the finances? PLease let us know as it will help us to help you tackle these situations and align ourselves accordingly. <This message was edited>
30/1/24, 10:37 AM - +263 77 263 2746: We need to pay Ashley school fees and the fees for his brother. This alone consumes about $500 every month. 

Ashley will write his examination in November 2024 that means we will be able not to save for his 2025 university education
30/1/24, 10:45 AM - +263 77 263 2746: Its possible for us to pay the registration fees in September 2024 to November 2024 . But we can't manage $150 at the moment as it is still going to his secondary education
30/1/24, 1:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about your challenges. As you suggest, if we start from September 2024 to November 2024 then, you will only be able to manage $450 which is not at all sufficient to handle the finances of Ashley's higher education. I hope you understand what I am trying to tell you?
30/1/24, 1:15 PM - +263 77 263 2746: We are able to raise $250 each month for that period
30/1/24, 2:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about it. As mentioned before the amount that needs to be saved at the end of November is $1500, but according to your plan, you are only going to save $750 which is the exact half of the amount that needs to be saved, hence not sufficient for even paying the registration fees. I hope you understand the importance of the whole 10-month plan, it is designed to help you only with the finances and ensure students are able to achieve their dreams.
30/1/24, 2:51 PM - +263 77 263 2746: We want to avoid a situation where by we secure his university and fail to pay for his secondary education. Our target is to tackle each stage as it comes hence we said upon final school fees payments of 2024 ( done in August) we then channels money to his university education
30/1/24, 4:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: Understandably, you are going to have to pay for the final school fees till August, but at the same time, Ashley will also start receiving offer letters from the universities. Now as you suggested you will start saving in September, but till then you would have already missed securing seats in universities because as mentioned, admissions are going to start in August. As a result, Ashley will miss out on this golden opportunity and all of your hard work will go in vain. I hope you are able to see from my perspective?
30/1/24, 4:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: At the same time, I was going through your application file and as per the same, you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of the Edoofa Enrollment fee of $150 before 4 January 2024. 

In light of this, I wanted to reach out to you, share a gentle reminder, and try to understand if you have been able to make the payment of your fee by now so that we can update the academic board accordingly?
31/1/24, 2:25 PM - +263 77 263 2746: We paid 200 on the 10th of January and the 150 was promised to be paid 30 days later.
31/1/24, 2:25 PM - +263 77 263 2746: We are very confident and sure come November 2024 we have the capacity to pay the 1500 as requested

I hope you are doing well. This is to inform you that since the deadline date for paying the remaining enrollment was 4th Feb 2024, you had asked for an extension till 14th Feb due to some challenges you were facing. But we still have not received any update from your side, so may I know if you were able to pay the remaining enrollment fee accordingly? If yes, may I please ask you to share the receipt of the enrollment fee? Or are you facing any kinds of challenges in doing so, because it has already been more than a month past the deadline?
