I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 10:59 AM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
18/1/24, 12:29 PM - +263 77 269 8788: Good day

*“Education is the key to unlocking the world. It is the passport to freedom.” ---- Oprah Winfrey*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
29/1/24, 11:52 AM - +263 71 395 4220: We may continue
29/1/24, 12:02 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So Kundai, are your parents available for the session?

Iam available
29/1/24, 12:15 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So before proceeding with the session, are there any questions you would like to ask?
29/1/24, 12:22 PM - +263 71 395 4220: Yes sure. Can I be eligible for a 80-100% scholarship?
Under what circumstances can I be eligible for this type of scholarship?
And, which intake will I be going for if I get this amazing opportunity?
29/1/24, 1:03 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Yes please Rufaro, You can be, eligible for the higher quantum of scholarship please
29/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 71 395 4220: Okay
29/1/24, 2:37 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me help you understand the Situation in Zimbabwe in much more detail

While the cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, the cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal which is Sadza and curry costs a student $1 one time and you are aware of this better. The cost of *Accommodation, Food, Wifi, stationery, gadgets, transport* etc is an additional expense for a student. The initial registration fee for the Zimbabwean Universities ranges from *$20-$75 without the guarantee of being eligible or not.* The *attachment fee before graduation ranges from $200 or more.*
29/1/24, 2:37 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me tell you, I was caught in surprise when I compared it with the Edoofa Scholarship Program, not because of affordability but the opportunity to acquire skills, knowledge and be employable. Speaking about Employability, do you feel Zimbabwe is ready to equip the graduates with job opportunities in their aspired fields?
29/1/24, 3:27 PM - +263 71 395 4220: Im not so sure
29/1/24, 3:28 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
29/1/24, 3:29 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counseling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program *as we recommended your application for a higher quantum of scholarship.* Congratulations on the same. Now, let us assume,
29/1/24, 3:29 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*

4. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
29/1/24, 3:29 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education ($1650-$1000= $650) and this remaining fee of $650 is supposed to be paid within 3 days of arrival.

*Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
29/1/24, 3:33 PM - +263 71 395 4220: I understand completely
29/1/24, 3:34 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelor of Business Administration and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
29/1/24, 4:12 PM - +263 71 395 4220: After receiving my Advanced level results and going through conversations concerning my future with either parents or people who have more experience and knowledge concerning Tertiary level education and how it will aid me in the future, I have happily decided to opt for another program. This is because I now know that I can take a challenge and come up with great academic results while still maintaining a proper work and play relationship for myself. Because of this, I've been looking at other programs that are a bit more challenging like 

1. Accounting
2. Investment banking 
3. Finance
4. Risk management and insurance
5. Auditing and lastly...
6. Digital banking
29/1/24, 4:13 PM - +263 71 395 4220: I am currently going through all these programs to gain a better understanding of them and choose the best one for myself after the process
29/1/24, 4:17 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Duly noted please
29/1/24, 4:18 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So Shall I brief you about a course that will help you reach these career aspirations?
29/1/24, 4:18 PM - +263 71 395 4220: Yes definitely

My parents and I were wondering which account we should use to make the admission payment mentioned by Mr Abhinav.
Should we continue using Mr Shorwi's account details?
19/2/24, 9:28 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me assist you with the details
19/2/24, 9:28 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: If you can make the payment from Harare, that case the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
19/2/24, 9:28 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
19/2/24, 9:28 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
19/2/24, 9:28 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send.
