16/1/24, 11:15 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Takunda,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 11:15 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

17/1/24, 8:52 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Takunda.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
17/1/24, 8:53 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly allow us time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, Mr. Sahil, the senior career counselor at Edoofa will connect with you to guide you on the next steps in your academic career.

24/1/24, 8:31 AM - Harmehak Edoofa: Good Day Takunda, 

I am Ms.Harmehak,Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction, I remembered that during our session you portrayed an enormous potential of becoming a leader of tomorrow. Hence I have asked my Colleague Mr.Sahil, Senior Academician to personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority. 

Hence I request you to come online and continue with your admission procedures. <This message was edited>
24/1/24, 8:08 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I see you have gone through my messages earlier but did not respond back, *please If there is something that is concerning you because of which you are not Proceeding ahead with your process, then I would request you to come forward and address the same with me here in the group so that I can provide you with a solution to cater to your issues and guide you with your admissions procedures.*

Since my working hours for the day are over now, *I have therefore scheduled your session for 09:30 AM CAT tomorrow*

God Bless you,
Have a great day ahead!
24/1/24, 8:33 PM - +263 77 390 2140: Is Edoofa really a cheaper education option for Takunda. May you please help prove it to us
25/1/24, 9:24 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good Morning Everyone, 

*“If you think education is expensive, try ignorance.” --- Andy McIntyre*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
25/1/24, 9:52 AM - +263 77 405 0858: Morning let's proceed
25/1/24, 12:09 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats, however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge.  Having Conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

25/1/24, 12:10 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 12:11 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: So for example Thats means for UZ $600*2 semester $1200 per year for tution fees $200 per year for internship 

$70 a month rent * 12 months = $840 a year for accommodation

Basic 3 meal sadza a day $1 per meal *3 meals a day *365 days = $1095 

Data bundles - $ 50 a month right * 12 months = $600 

Misc- $300 

Total at UZ = Exceeds $4100
25/1/24, 12:12 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I am shocked to compile these data for Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities of Zimbabwe.

Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE) -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - ($680 per term)

Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT) https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - ($535 per term)

University of Zimbabwe (UZ) -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm ($523 per term)

NUST -($870 per term)

I'm sure you and your family have discussed this thoroughly. What decisions have you made for your future? Considering the cost and employment opportunities, have you compared the benefits of studying in India with the Edoofa program against other options? @263773902140 @263774050858
25/1/24, 12:22 PM - +263 77 405 0858: Are we dealing with local universities  NO we are looking at Galgotias which gave us the offer letter it is charging double the fees offered here, #900 tution fee +$100 exam fee +$2500 food and accommodation not mentioning flight charges.My point is let's focus more on the student's schoolarship,we were hoping to be relieved from those high fees with Edoofa schoolarship programe
25/1/24, 12:56 PM - +263 77 390 2140: This is not true
25/1/24, 12:57 PM - +263 77 390 2140: You may now share how much a student will pay per term when studying under Edoofa
25/1/24, 3:43 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: $2000-$3000
25/1/24, 3:45 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Please I have already attached links of official websites of Universities in Zimbabwe you can verify the things are clear and transparent .
25/1/24, 3:49 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: It appears there might be a miscalculation in the finances. May I inquire if you are available for a call to clarify things?
25/1/24, 6:49 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 8:04 PM - +263 77 390 2140: In your calculation you assumed that students will be in college 365 days/year which is not so. Thus rent and food are overstated.

Moreover, data bundles are overstated. I use not more than $20/month. For students they use less because most of the time they access Wi-Fi.
29/1/24, 10:27 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good Morning Everyone, 

*“Education is the key to unlocking the world. It is the passport to freedom.” ---- Oprah Winfrey*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.

29/1/24, 11:29 AM - +263 77 390 2140: I am in, Harare, Zimbabwe and I argue that some of the information is not correct. However, may you supply similar estimates for someone who is studying in India under Edoofa. This will help us compare
29/1/24, 12:39 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Please are you available for a call ?
29/1/24, 12:39 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: We can have a proper discussion over call ?
29/1/24, 1:24 PM - +263 77 390 2140: Unfortunately im not available. I'm at work, attending a meeting. Text based discussion would have bwwn best because we have somewhere to refer to
29/1/24, 2:19 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: @263773902140 Please understand in text messages there might be communication gapes so make discussion smooth we can have a discussion over call and then we can sent a proper document to you to go through.

You might have noticed that I Despite not being part of the admission team, as a member of the academic bench have stepped up as I personally noticed challenges in your admission process, so I'm here to help. I'll personally ensure your application is completed within three days, securing the maximum scholarship percentage possible .This will make your education more affordable than studying locally and open up maximum employment prospects. Trust me to handle everything, and let's start fresh for a successful outcome.
29/1/24, 3:12 PM - +263 77 405 0858: Meaning to say   that offer letter is null and void,as we are starting afresh
29/1/24, 3:12 PM - +263 77 405 0858: ?
29/1/24, 3:17 PM - +263 77 390 2140: Unfortunately, I am not available for a call because of work. I have had difficulties with previous calls because of accent. That is why I especially prefer written communication. Unless it's a non-event. Maybe @263774050858 is available you may go ahead
29/1/24, 3:21 PM - +263 77 405 0858: I am very much comfortable with these messages as well,👏🏽

29/1/24, 4:13 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: What time can parents have call tomorrow ?
29/1/24, 7:59 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 8:35 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Good morning Everyone!*  let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*"As the scriptures teach, knowledge is a steadfast companion. A person enlightened by wisdom is held in high regard across all realms. The brilliance of education surpasses the allure of beauty and the vigor of youth."*

 With positive energy, let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education. So shall we begin ?
30/1/24, 6:52 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I was anticipating your response today but unfortunately, you were not available all day. I look forward to your active participation tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT time. I am eager for our interaction. As we embark on a new day, let's reflect on the wisdom from Proverbs 3:5-6 (NIV): *'Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.'*
31/1/24, 10:00 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning! Drawing inspiration from biblical wisdom: 

*"In the sacred texts, we find that knowledge is a faithful companion, elevating one to respect beyond borders. Education outshines both beauty and youth."*

Let's fuel our positive energy and continue our interactive session.
1/2/24, 8:36 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good Morning 
I hope you are doing well!
I've noticed that my messages have been read but not responded to. Is everything alright?
1/2/24, 8:43 AM - +263 77 390 2140: Good morning. Honestly, we are losing faith in the Edoofa scheme. It all looks like a scam
1/2/24, 9:39 AM - +263 77 405 0858: Very true,it seems it's  well organized one
1/2/24, 9:49 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: If you are not open to engaging in a discussion, it becomes challenging for us to assist you. We provide all the necessary resources for verification, and it's important to note that Edoofa has been operating in Africa for many years. If we were a scam, the government would have taken action against us long ago.
1/2/24, 9:52 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Why would we repeatedly ask for calls to assist you if we were a scam? We already have the enrollment fees. If we were fraudulent, we would have blocked you after receiving the money. However, since June 2023, we have been actively trying to help you and engage in productive discussions. To truly benefit from this, it's essential to think outside the box. As the saying goes, "It is impossible for a man to learn what he thinks he already knows."
1/2/24, 9:58 AM - +263 77 405 0858: We are not seeing any progress other than the need for us to pay admission fees before we are satisfied with the other offer letters from other universities.
1/2/24, 1:05 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Now that you've openly shared your concerns, I'll ensure you receive additional offers for comparison. If this information had been communicated earlier, I could have made arrangements accordingly.
1/2/24, 1:05 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Can you please A level results ?
2/2/24, 9:17 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning! let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*Proverbs 9:9 (NIV):*
*"Instruct the wise and they will be wiser still; teach the righteous and they will add to their learning."*

Let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education.
2/2/24, 9:51 AM - +263 77 390 2140: Here is a question: Do you work with all universities in India or you have selected institutions that you are affiliated to?
2/2/24, 10:02 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Edoofa has worked with  250+ globally ranked and internationally accredited universities. Our strict criteria ensure that we only partner with institutions recognized by NAAC or UGC, governing bodies that regulate the quality of education and university infrastructure abroad. This commitment to quality ensures that universities affiliated with Edoofa meet stringent standards.
2/2/24, 10:40 AM - +263 77 390 2140: Noted.
2/2/24, 1:50 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I want you to share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
3/2/24, 8:27 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning
How are you doing today?
5/2/24, 9:15 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning! let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*Proverbs 2:10-11 (NIV):*
*"For wisdom will enter your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul. Discretion will protect you, and understanding will guard you."*

Let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education
5/2/24, 7:21 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Embrace education as the key to a brighter future. Proverbs 4:7 (NIV) wisely states, "The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom." Seize the opportunity to break free from limitations. Keep in mind Philippians 4:13 (NIV), "I can do all this through him who gives me strength." Let education empower your child!*

Over the past few days, we've been trying to connect with you to discuss your child's academic journey. We understand the financial commitments involved in providing quality education for your child. The challenges in Africa, particularly the uncertainty of employment after completing a bachelor's degree, are evident.

Considering the urgency of your child's education, I've scheduled a session for *tomorrow at 09:30 AM CAT* .Looking forward to connecting with you tomorrow.
5/2/24, 10:03 PM - +263 77 390 2140: Thank you for your efforts in selling your buainess to us.

This statement is not peculiar to Africa: *'The challenges in Africa, particularly the uncertainty of employment after completing a bachelor's degree are evident'*

I believe in India you also have unemployed graduates
6/2/24, 9:40 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning! let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*Proverbs 1:5:*

*"Let the wise listen and add to their learning.' In the tapestry of progress, education is the thread that weaves nations together. As India seeks wisdom, let us prioritize education, creating a future where knowledge transcends boundaries and resonates more profoundly than ever. A commitment to learning is a commitment to a thriving, united nation."*

Let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education ,Shall we start?
6/2/24, 9:40 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Can you share this so that I can help ????
7/2/24, 10:08 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning
How are you doing today?
7/2/24, 10:51 AM - +263 77 390 2140: Hi. I am fine
7/2/24, 10:55 AM - +263 77 390 2140: I hope tou realize that our participation in these sessions is no longer lively. I am sure you understand the reasons why we are pulling back from these schemes. Were having a lot of back and forth in this whole process. It looks like the money that one eventually pays for studies is the same as enrolling straigh to a university without Edoofa. Why the hustle, after all?
7/2/24, 10:56 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Let me call you
7/2/24, 10:57 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: null
7/2/24, 10:58 AM - +263 77 390 2140: Sorry I cant take the call as I'm busy at work.
7/2/24, 11:00 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your engagement in the process. I believe a brief call would be beneficial to address your queries and streamline the process. Could you please take a moment to pick up my call? I'm eager to discuss your concerns and ensure a smoother transition to the university without any unnecessary hassle for you.
7/2/24, 11:03 AM - +263 77 405 0858: .
7/2/24, 11:04 AM - +263 77 390 2140: Honestly, after all this period of counseling and cumbersome EYL activities for my children you send us a costly offer letter from Galgotias University? I feel the money, time and effort is really not worth it.
7/2/24, 11:09 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: That was one of the offer as we mentioned  during counseling session you get multiple offers. Different universities on evaluation universities give different percentage of scholarship and since A level results are out now is the best time to send applications to other universities as well that is the reason I wanted you share the documents which I request on Friday.
7/2/24, 11:10 AM - +263 77 390 2140: But why do you prefer verbal over written conversation??

I aired my concerns through text. I would never have expressed better verbally, in a call. I wonder if you cant do the same and create a reference for tomorrow.

If we talk through a call today then tomorrow we have nothing to refer to. Maybe it's because I have a short memory or it's a known demerit for verbal communication <This message was edited>

7/2/24, 11:26 AM - +263 77 405 0858: I once asked,why was the rush to take admission for universities before results are out and we were given very short time to pay.
7/2/24, 11:26 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I am one in grey suit
7/2/24, 11:28 AM - +263 77 390 2140: I see you
7/2/24, 11:51 AM - +263 77 390 2140: Equally concerned
7/2/24, 11:53 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: So can we have a call ?

7/2/24, 12:36 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: We can have proper continues decisions over call at once.
7/2/24, 1:08 PM - +263 77 390 2140: Im not comfortable with calls. Audio clips would be better
7/2/24, 1:45 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Can you please share O level and Identity so that I can submit your application.
7/2/24, 3:29 PM - +263 77 405 0858: Are you a different team from the one we send all these documents to
7/2/24, 3:30 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I am from the *Academic board* I was recently added to the group by your counselor Ms.Harmehak
7/2/24, 3:33 PM - +263 77 405 0858: Yes Ms Harmehak has all the information with her
7/2/24, 3:49 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Can you please resend ?

8/2/24, 2:15 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good afternoon
How are you doing today?
8/2/24, 3:15 PM - +263 77 390 2140: Fine and you?

8/2/24, 3:56 PM - +263 77 405 0858: The video,does not show what was taking place, no voices heard
8/2/24, 4:00 PM - +263 77 390 2140: I have seen the photos and video clips of that Indian man shaking hands with Auxilia

21/2/24, 10:05 AM - +263 77 390 2140: We are no longer interested in Edoofa
21/2/24, 10:09 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: May I know the reason for the same ?
21/2/24, 10:09 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I have already requested letters from other universities
27/2/24, 12:47 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good afternoon
How are you doing today?
27/2/24, 2:51 PM - +263 77 390 2140: Sorry for delayed response. Thankunda and Nathaniel have been admitted in Zimbabwean universities. We had to take the firat offera that came our way since they looked cheaper and clearer than what Edoofa has offered us so far
27/2/24, 2:51 PM - +263 77 390 2140: Very well, thank you
27/2/24, 4:24 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Which university in Zimbabwe ?
27/2/24, 4:26 PM - +263 77 390 2140: May you leave that to us as a family
28/2/24, 1:12 AM - +263 77 405 0858: Thanks for your concern,your schoolarship admission process is very long,so we have decided as a family to enroll our children at a local university,we have been waiting for different offer letters from different universities but to our surprise we didn't get the response from your side .you promised to review the schoolarship percentage since we have given you the A level results,your side is still silent,we consider time for the preparation which we see is moving.
28/2/24, 8:38 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Please as mentioned you will get the letters.
28/2/24, 8:45 AM - +263 77 390 2140: How will the letters help?
28/2/24, 8:54 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: How can I explain if you are not at all ready to have a call please?
28/2/24, 8:59 AM - +263 77 390 2140: We are no longer interested in Edoofa. We gave you time to prove its worth and we saw. That's how we came to this decision as a family.
29/2/24, 8:50 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I hope you understand internationally intake starts in July August so that means the application is going at right pace ?
29/2/24, 8:53 AM - +263 77 390 2140: Is that what was promised before? Or im forgetting?
29/2/24, 8:55 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I mentioned earlier that the university application has been submitted, and you can expect to receive the acceptance letter soon, just as promised!
29/2/24, 9:06 AM - +263 77 390 2140: That is not it
29/2/24, 9:22 AM - +263 77 390 2140: Are you going to refund us?
