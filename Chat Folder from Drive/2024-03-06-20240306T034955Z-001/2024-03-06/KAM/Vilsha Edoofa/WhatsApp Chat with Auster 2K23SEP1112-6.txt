In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their msce  results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 1:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your msce results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education.

I sincerely apologize for the delay,.

It's incredibly challenging to cope with the passing of one loved one, let alone two in such a short span of time. Organizing and arranging the ceremonies for both your brother's daughter and your grandparent must have been emotionally and financially taxing for your family.
26/1/24, 8:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Since you were able to update me I will surely be able to have a discussion with the board about the same.
26/1/24, 8:38 PM - +265 991 40 67 78: We entirely promise to seal the matter by the mentioned date

Please also mention your admission group name in the mail once done please share the screenshot with us so that we can even update the university officials.
26/1/24, 8:41 PM - +265 991 40 67 78: No problem thanks
26/1/24, 8:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I will wait for your response.
26/1/24, 9:42 PM - +265 991 40 67 78: Hello everyone on the board,

We are samala family, part of the edoofians
Our admission group name is Auster 2K23SEP1112.

Just recently this evening of 26 January 24,we had a talk with  our admission officer Ms. Kirti discussing about the final payment of the registration fee of Auster Samala.

It has been a shock to our family facing two challenges within consecutive weeks,
This misfortune is funerals, last week we lost our grand parent and just 3days ago losing also a daughter of my young brother, all these incidences happened while we had prepared to finish our registration fee of 300us dollars by 28th January 24.
Much of the funds raised to cover the registration fee had been used to help facilitating matters and activities on both occasions.
Ending to disturb our preparations.

Now this evening we were in talks with our admission officer Ms. Kirti that she should wait for us till on Friday next week on the 2 Feb 24.
We sincerely apologize for the delay. We just ask God to take us safe through this week that nothing should intervene and disturb also our preparations/budget.

Lastly we ask the board to consider and understand our concern and we promise that we will fulfil the process.

Yours faithfully.
THE SAMALA FAMILY.

1/3/24, 11:00 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: It is indeed wonderful to hear that the family is doing well, @265991406778. Your enthusiasm and warmth are always appreciated, and we are glad to have you and your child as part of the Edoofa family.

Please excuse our recent silence. Ms. Kirti encountered an unfortunate situation which prevented her from connecting with the students. Additionally, the Edoofa Team recently traveled to Zimbabwe to meet with our students, which kept us quite occupied. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.

We are excited to inform you that we will be coming to Malawi towards the end of March. Once the details are finalized, we will share them with you. We are eagerly looking forward to meeting you and your family in Malawi.
1/3/24, 12:20 PM - +265 991 40 67 78: Ooo that's very interesting, amazing, wonderful, encouraging in another way, welcome in advance.
1/3/24, 12:22 PM - +265 991 40 67 78: Yah just heard of the unfortunate, so sorry for that,we just wish her as family to be strong in this sorrowful moments.
1/3/24, 12:23 PM - +265 991 40 67 78: Also heard of the trip to Zimbabwe which reflects articulation of edoofa
1/3/24, 1:31 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Certainly, and thank you for your well wishes. I will be sharing several videos and pictures of the seminar from Zimbabwe to give you a glimpse of what you can expect in Malawi this month. In Ms. Kirti's absence, I have been reviewing Auster's application file and I noticed that you have been facing some challenges with the payment of his registration fee. Considering this, I wanted to reach out and inquire if you have been able to resolve the same challenge, or if you still need assistance regarding it?
1/3/24, 1:40 PM - +265 991 40 67 78: Payment, we did it just waiting for a final confirmation from your side
1/3/24, 1:41 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: I see @265991406778, do you have the debit messages from your bank for the payment of your university registration fee? As per the records we have and the updates from the bank, the payments made by you have been reversed because you mentioned the incorrect bank details.
1/3/24, 1:47 PM - +265 991 40 67 78: I have the hard copies of which some of them I already sent on the forum, in fact I did 2 transactions,
1/3/24, 1:50 PM - +265 991 40 67 78: Only the second payment was reversed with no proper reasons, but I strictly told the bank to resend because the first one was confirmed like it went through from your side,
1/3/24, 1:53 PM - +265 991 40 67 78: So give me a clear picture if all the transactions had been acknowledged by that side.
1/3/24, 1:57 PM - +265 991 40 67 78: 1,enrolment fee,$200
2,registration fee, $300
3,registration fee, $260
The $260 came just because the bank told me that the last $300 was reversed then it came to $260 due to some charges of the reverse,
1/3/24, 1:58 PM - +265 991 40 67 78: By that time I tried to link you people,it's when you were in Zimbabwe and no one was available by that time,
1/3/24, 1:59 PM - +265 991 40 67 78: So advise me what is on the ground there

1/3/24, 2:01 PM - +265 991 40 67 78: First $300 of the registration fee
1/3/24, 2:03 PM - +265 991 40 67 78: I will send in the evening all the hard copies in details for I am away from home now,
1/3/24, 2:04 PM - +265 991 40 67 78: <Media omitted>
1/3/24, 2:04 PM - +265 991 40 67 78: Second payment, I will send the supporting documents in the evening
1/3/24, 2:27 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: @265991406778, I have reviewed the receipts you shared in the group, and upon inspection, I noticed that the IBAN Number was mentioned instead of the Account Number in the Swift receipt. Due to this discrepancy, the payment has not been reflected in our records. You mentioned that the payment for the first part of $300 has been cleared from your end. Could you confirm if you have received a debit message from your bank for this transaction?
1/3/24, 2:32 PM - +265 991 40 67 78: I already received all the debit messages for all the transactions
1/3/24, 2:32 PM - +265 991 40 67 78: They deducted everything already
1/3/24, 2:32 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Okay @265991406778, could you please share the debit messages with us so that I can see how best we can help you here?
1/3/24, 2:36 PM - +265 991 40 67 78: Let me scroll back if I may get them
1/3/24, 2:50 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Surely @265991406778, please do the same.

1/3/24, 3:06 PM - +265 991 40 67 78: <Media omitted>
1/3/24, 3:06 PM - +265 991 40 67 78: Check these also
2/3/24, 7:54 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: @265991406778, as per the updates we received from the bank in India, the registration fee amount you paid has been reversed. Since your bank has not notified you of this, we can request our bank to raise the concern via email and share it with your bank for immediate resolution. To proceed, we require the bank statement of the account confirming that these two payments have been deducted and remitted forward from your end. Could you please check with your bank for the necessary bank statement?
2/3/24, 7:56 AM - +265 991 40 67 78: So Shameful,
2/3/24, 7:58 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: @265991406778, I believe there might be a mistake by your bank in processing the fee because of which the payment has been reversed hence you would have to check with them for the bank statement and accordingly we will be able to assist you in the best possible way.
2/3/24, 7:58 AM - +265 991 40 67 78: If it's so, why has the money been reversed?
2/3/24, 7:59 AM - +265 991 40 67 78: This morning, I will also send you other swift copies which the bank gave me showing that the transactions were processed
2/3/24, 8:01 AM - +265 991 40 67 78: What pains me is that, all the cost for sending and reversing are all falling on me,, imagine
2/3/24, 8:01 AM - +265 991 40 67 78: Okay I will follow it up, now it's a big punch to me
2/3/24, 8:03 AM - +265 991 40 67 78: I thought am done with this so as to go on the next stage, so as this it's some steps backwards which shows no progress.
2/3/24, 8:09 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, @265991406778, I understand the position you are in. This is one of the biggest challenges that people in Malawi face with the banking system in place. We are fully prepared to start the next steps, and in pursuit of that, it's crucial to ensure that the initial admission formalities are completed to avoid any challenges. 

Since the payment has been reversed, it essentially resets the process for him to start anew and that is something we are trying to avoid. Given the urgency of this matter, you should take the proactive step of checking with your bank and obtaining an update from their end.

Moreover, the amount of transaction charges that have been debited by the bank should not be deducted again, as the mistake was made by the bank. They should re-process the amount once the details are corrected.
2/3/24, 8:13 AM - +265 991 40 67 78: I will send you everything then you help me where I went wrong as of my side aswell
2/3/24, 8:14 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: Surely @265991406778, I would personally be here to assist you with the same concern.
2/3/24, 8:15 AM - +265 991 40 67 78: As for the bank today Saturday, forex side they don't work which means on monday
2/3/24, 8:17 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: That would be absolutely fine @265991406778, you can share an update with us on Monday and we will reconnect with each other accordingly.
2/3/24, 8:18 AM - +265 991 40 67 78: As of this morning, I will gather all documents I have then will send to you
2/3/24, 8:19 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: Surely @265991406778.

2/3/24, 9:47 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the messages once again sir. I have reviewed everything you shared in the group, and upon inspection, as I shared with you earlier, the IBAN Number has been mentioned instead of the Account Number in the receipts because of which the payment has been reversed and you must have incurred the transfer charges as well. This mistake can be correct by your bank and hence when you visit them on Monday, please ensure to highlight this as well.

5/3/24, 3:51 PM - +265 991 40 67 78: Greetings all
5/3/24, 3:51 PM - +265 991 40 67 78: How is everyone
5/3/24, 3:52 PM - +265 991 40 67 78: I went to the bank today as discussed last Saturday
5/3/24, 3:53 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Auster

We are doing well, thank you for asking. Please, how are you and your family doing today? How was your weekend?
5/3/24, 3:53 PM - +265 991 40 67 78: There are indeed issues which needs to be sorted pertaining to the payments which I had been doing
5/3/24, 3:54 PM - +265 991 40 67 78: <Media omitted>
5/3/24, 3:55 PM - +265 991 40 67 78: This was the enrollment fee swift copy from the same bank
5/3/24, 3:56 PM - +265 991 40 67 78: It's only showing the account number and there is Iban number.
5/3/24, 3:57 PM - +265 991 40 67 78: I mean no Iban number
5/3/24, 3:58 PM - +265 991 40 67 78: I gave them, lastly they just said I should wait for them to discuss then they come to me so am just waiting for them tomorrow again
5/3/24, 4:03 PM - +265 991 40 67 78: According to there explanation,
1,
The first payment it's not showing the exact destination in the system, whether it's in your account or not.
2,
The second payment, they reversed $190 from the $300 which I sent, of which the $110 am just chopped for nothing including the local charges aswell
5/3/24, 4:05 PM - +265 991 40 67 78: <Media omitted>
5/3/24, 4:07 PM - +265 991 40 67 78: This is what I have been given today as a transaction reversal, so you can see the date stamp its for today
5/3/24, 4:07 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, that is correct @265991406778 and since they mentioned the account number, this payment was transferred to India and has been confirmed by the accounts team as well. However, for the registration fee, the bank made an error because of which they processed the payment on the IBAN Number and hence the payment was reversed. 

It is alright if the bank has taken some time to verify the status and if they will give you an update tomorrow, you can take the same time and reconnect with us tomorrow. Once you help us with the clarity from the bank, only then we will update the academic board and the accounts team. Rest assured that there is nothing to be worried about since you have now alerted the bank.
5/3/24, 4:08 PM - +265 991 40 67 78: Now these people were just sitting on this matter not to inform me, I never knew it.
5/3/24, 4:09 PM - +265 991 40 67 78: Hope you have also witnessed my side that I did my part
5/3/24, 4:10 PM - +265 991 40 67 78: Don't know from your side how do you take this matter now?
5/3/24, 4:12 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, @265991406778 I am glad to see that you have taken the proactive step and you know as I was sharing with you the other day as well, this is one of the challenges that students and parents face in Africa, particularly countries like Malawi. From here on, once you get an update from your bank on the payment of the registration fee for the first part and the second part, the payment will have to be reprocessed from the bank to India so that we can ensure that Auster’s university admission formalities are completed without any further challenges.
