Hope you are well.

Team Edoofa experienced a whirlwind over the past three days, with activities bustling in both India and Harare for the Meet and Greet '24 event. After a brief moment to collect ourselves, we're ready to return to our original schedule and move forward in our journey. 
*Our session will commence today at 1:30 PM.*
22/2/24, 12:33 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I'm happy to share that our team just got back from an incredible event in Zimbabwe, and let me tell you, this time our Meet & Greet event was bigger and better! It was an amazing three-day event! 🎉

This time, it wasn't just Mr. Angad who went, but our whole admissions team, counseling team, and the program director joined in too!

Students and parents alike had the exclusive opportunity to dive deep into the exciting journey that awaits them in India. And guess what? Mr. Angad himself talked about exciting employment opportunities for everyone in India along with the EWYL plan. We also organized a special scholarship test for students who aren't part of the Edoofian community yet. <This message was edited>
22/2/24, 12:34 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I've got some photos to share with you. Get ready for a sneak peek into the excitement and energy of the event!

Also, we're planning to bring the excitement to Zambia too! So, get ready to embark on a journey filled with endless possibilities and boundless opportunities.

22/2/24, 12:58 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Indeed!
22/2/24, 1:26 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So let's begin with today's session🚀
22/2/24, 1:43 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: We can
22/2/24, 1:47 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So Labbana, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
22/2/24, 2:27 PM - Aditi Edoofa: @265999528202 I am waiting for your response.
22/2/24, 2:46 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: You know what...as a parent I've been answering too many questions ever since we started these conversations and I feel some how tired with question after question of which I don't know if they have any connections to the application of a scholarship we're looking for. Plus too many groups being added to so mmmh I feel tired anyway
22/2/24, 3:08 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I completely understand your concerns and the feeling of exhaustion from answering numerous questions. Applying for scholarships can indeed involve a lot of inquiries and group interactions, which can be overwhelming at times. It's important to take breaks and prioritize self-care during this process. Remember, you're not alone in this journey, and we're here to support you every step of the way. Take care! <This message was edited>
22/2/24, 3:29 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Surely so
22/2/24, 3:59 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
22/2/24, 4:31 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to tell you that we would also be coming to Malawi!
22/2/24, 4:34 PM - Aditi Edoofa: This message was deleted
22/2/24, 6:23 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Thanks alot 

Hopefully will attend your meetings
26/2/24, 1:30 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Happy Monday!🌺
Hope you are well.

Are you ready for the session?💯
26/2/24, 2:58 PM - Aditi Edoofa: @265999528202 @265995675805 May I know why didn't Labbana show up for today's session?
27/2/24, 1:30 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Labbana!
Hope you are well.

Are you ready for the session?💯
27/2/24, 1:36 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Yes.
27/2/24, 1:37 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
27/2/24, 1:37 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met.
27/2/24, 1:39 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: You may go ahead
27/2/24, 1:41 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *Labbana* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach her professional goals.
27/2/24, 1:41 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
27/2/24, 1:47 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Yes...am following
27/2/24, 1:47 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
27/2/24, 2:01 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Thanks
27/2/24, 2:04 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates *Labbana* to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either *Monday/Thursday* or *Tuesday/Friday*. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
27/2/24, 2:08 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: But get informed that am the father of Winnie who's applying for the scholarship..so am I the one to carry out the activities or Winnie,my ward?
27/2/24, 2:11 PM - Aditi Edoofa: No sir, I understand, this message is just to inform you that this would be the schedule when she would be back.
27/2/24, 2:15 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Ok .. understood
27/2/24, 2:19 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once *Labbana* forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.

29/2/24, 2:22 PM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for *Labbana*’s EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure she is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
29/2/24, 2:24 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Thanks and following
29/2/24, 2:38 PM - Aditi Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that *Labbana* will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
29/2/24, 2:38 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/2/24, 2:47 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: It's a long one and I'll need enough to go through
29/2/24, 3:00 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, sure!
You may take your time.
29/2/24, 3:05 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The session time has concluded for now, we will meet tomorrow for our session at the same time, so make sure you are on time.⌛
