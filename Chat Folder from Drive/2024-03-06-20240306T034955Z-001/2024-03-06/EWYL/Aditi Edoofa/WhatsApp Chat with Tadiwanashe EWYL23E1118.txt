Hope you are well.

Team Edoofa experienced a whirlwind over the past three days, with activities bustling in both India and Harare for the Meet and Greet '24 event. After a brief moment to collect ourselves, we're ready to return to our original schedule and move forward in our journey. 
*Our session will commence today at 8:30 AM.*
22/2/24, 8:28 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So let's begin with today's session🚀
22/2/24, 9:35 AM - Aditi Edoofa: @263717351885 @27729470473 May I know why Tadiwanashe didn't show up for today's session?
22/2/24, 3:42 PM - +27 72 947 0473: Goodday..Tadiwanashe failed to attend although she had a representative because she is currently at a boarding school far away from Harare..so with the short notice logistically it was a hustle ...considering again the network challenges caused by power shortages.
22/2/24, 4:00 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good day! 
Hope you are doing well.

Thank you for letting us know. I understand that Tadiwanashe couldn't attend the event in person due to being at a boarding school far from Harare. Logistically, it can be challenging, especially with short notice and network issues caused by power shortages.
22/2/24, 4:10 PM - +27 72 947 0473: Thank you maam
26/2/24, 8:37 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Happy Monday!🌺
Hope you are well.

Are you ready for the session?💯
26/2/24, 9:37 AM - Aditi Edoofa: @263717351885 @27729470473 I noticed you missed the session again, and I wanted to check in to make sure everything is okay. It's important to attend these sessions as your contributions are valued. If there are any issues preventing your attendance, please inform me. Your presence is crucial, and I expect your participation moving forward
26/2/24, 10:01 AM - +263 71 735 1885: Sometimes l will be in class lessons so it will be hard for me to participate as phones are not allowed during classes
26/2/24, 10:34 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, may I know if you would be available from 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM for our sessions.
26/2/24, 1:45 PM - +27 72 947 0473: Goodday ma'am..yes I missed the first part because of work maam
26/2/24, 2:25 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I understand, so may I know which time suits you better for your sessions?
26/2/24, 2:31 PM - +27 72 947 0473: I understand Tadiwanashe will be done with school waiting for study from 4pm and her mother finishes work at4 pm so I think 4pm  is more convenient
26/2/24, 2:43 PM - Aditi Edoofa: @27729470473 I am afraid that I won't be able to accommodate that time as it does not align with me working hours.
26/2/24, 2:45 PM - +27 72 947 0473: What time is convenient to you
26/2/24, 2:47 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I have two batches one id from 8:30 AM to 9:30 AM CAT and the other batch is from 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM CAT.
26/2/24, 2:49 PM - +27 72 947 0473: 1:30  to 2:30 PM is better
26/2/24, 3:01 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, great.
So from now on our sessions will be held at this time, looking forward to our sessions.
26/2/24, 3:25 PM - +27 72 947 0473: Thank you
27/2/24, 1:30 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Tadiwanashe!
Hope you are well.

Are you ready for the session?💯
27/2/24, 1:35 PM - +27 72 947 0473: Goodday
27/2/24, 1:35 PM - +27 72 947 0473: We are ready
27/2/24, 1:36 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
27/2/24, 1:36 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So Tadiwanashe, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
27/2/24, 1:49 PM - +27 72 947 0473: I would love to be own a law firm so that I will be able to help other disadvantaged people in my community so as assisting my parents financially. EWYL will help me to lighten the load my parents have by paying for my own tuition
27/2/24, 1:49 PM - Aditi Edoofa: That's a wonderful aspiration! Owning a law firm would not only enable you to make a positive impact by assisting disadvantaged individuals in your community but also provide financial support to your parents. Participating in EWYL sounds like a great step towards achieving your goals, as it will help alleviate the financial burden on your parents by covering your tuition expenses. Keep working hard towards your dreams, and I'm sure you'll achieve them!
27/2/24, 1:50 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
27/2/24, 1:52 PM - +27 72 947 0473: Not yet maam
27/2/24, 1:52 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
27/2/24, 1:52 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
27/2/24, 2:34 PM - Aditi Edoofa: We are concluding today's session. We will reconvene tomorrow for our session.🚀
27/2/24, 2:40 PM - +27 72 947 0473: Thank you
28/2/24, 1:39 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Happy Wednesday!✨
Hope you are well.

28/2/24, 2:59 PM - +27 72 947 0473: Sorry ma'am I had challenges with my power this side ma'am
28/2/24, 2:59 PM - +27 72 947 0473: My apologies but we are sorted now
28/2/24, 3:05 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I understand, but now as you are aware that the session time is over so we will connect tomorrow, make sure you are on time.
28/2/24, 3:13 PM - +27 72 947 0473: I understand ma'am, my apologies. Thank you we will connect tomorrow
28/2/24, 4:04 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!
29/2/24, 1:33 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon!☀️
Hope you are well.

Are you ready for the session?🚀
29/2/24, 1:58 PM - +27 72 947 0473: Good afternoon now
29/2/24, 2:11 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
29/2/24, 2:12 PM - +27 72 947 0473: Thank you
29/2/24, 2:20 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
29/2/24, 2:33 PM - +27 72 947 0473: Very interesting
29/2/24, 2:48 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

1/3/24, 2:40 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
