26/2/24, 2:11 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I can see that there is someone else who has joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
26/2/24, 2:18 PM - +263 78 483 1208: I did not recently add someone in the group. I only shared the group link to my parents as instructed by the Admission officer.
26/2/24, 2:19 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, noted!
26/2/24, 2:19 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So Runyararo, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?

27/2/24, 1:32 PM - +263 78 483 1208: Good afternoon Ms Aditi,I am ready for the session
27/2/24, 1:34 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
27/2/24, 1:35 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
27/2/24, 1:43 PM - +263 78 483 1208: No Ms Aditi. You can explain in detail.
27/2/24, 1:44 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
27/2/24, 1:44 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
27/2/24, 1:49 PM - +263 78 483 1208: Well Explained Ms Aditi. I have clearly understood the two objectives.
27/2/24, 1:49 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
27/2/24, 1:49 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
27/2/24, 1:58 PM - +263 78 483 1208: Thank you for the introductions about my EWYL team. I would like to share my warm greetings to Ms Sanjana and Ms Davi. It's an honour to be in collaboration with the EWYL team.
27/2/24, 2:00 PM - Aditi Edoofa: You're welcome!
27/2/24, 2:01 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
27/2/24, 2:09 PM - +263 78 483 1208: Noted. It sounds intriguing Ms Aditi.
27/2/24, 2:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Superb!
27/2/24, 2:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

28/2/24, 1:55 PM - +263 78 483 1208: Absolutely great.
28/2/24, 2:05 PM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
28/2/24, 2:07 PM - +263 78 483 1208: It sounds incredible Ms Aditi.
28/2/24, 2:19 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
28/2/24, 2:19 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.

It is platform meant for us to provide our solutions and give a word of advice to the youth to instill justice , peace and a balanced society. Edoofians use the Hall of Inspiration to give testimonials and their experience since childhood.

1/3/24, 2:03 PM - +263 78 483 1208: The EWYL program is a fantastic opportunity for gaining relevant 21st century skills. Skills necessary to prepare a student for "jobs of the future".The document listed the required skills and these are emerging skills ,enduring skills and other skills deemed necessary. 
The Edoofa Ewyl program also initiated programs/activities expected for every student. There are three most effective programs and these are corporate alliance, community building and African schools educating reform program. In each of the programs there are certain objectives that must be accomplished for a student to gain  scholarship credits. This helps students to self sponsor and manage their own tuition fee. The programs are very beneficial in boosting networking, self confidence and persistence
1/3/24, 2:42 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Please excuse me for the delay in reply as I was facing some network challenges.
1/3/24, 2:42 PM - Aditi Edoofa: You know what, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
1/3/24, 2:42 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Additionally, I want to inform you that at present, the first project is on hold owing to the substantial number of projects and commitments we are currently managing.

1/3/24, 3:01 PM - +263 78 483 1208: Thank you. Your response has made me happy.
1/3/24, 3:02 PM - +263 78 483 1208: You can proceed
