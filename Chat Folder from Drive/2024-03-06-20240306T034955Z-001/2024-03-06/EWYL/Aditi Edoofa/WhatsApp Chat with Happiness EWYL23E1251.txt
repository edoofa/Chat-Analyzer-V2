I am looking forward to your response to my above message.
21/2/24, 4:40 PM - +263 78 121 2611: The event was a great one and they should do it  more often because l gained full trust on them and l was also educated on a lot of things including the slice cone which was very interesting. I think the Edoofa program is the best and keep on doing the good work
22/2/24, 8:01 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning Happiness!
Hope you are well.

Team Edoofa experienced a whirlwind over the past three days, with activities bustling in both India and Harare for the Meet and Greet '24 event. After a brief moment to collect ourselves, we're ready to return to our original schedule and move forward in our journey.

26/2/24, 8:38 AM - +263 78 121 2611: Yes am ready
26/2/24, 8:40 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
26/2/24, 8:41 AM - Aditi Edoofa: That's fantastic to hear about your aspirations to study abroad and pursue both a bachelor's and master's degree! The EWYL program sounds like an excellent opportunity to help you achieve your goals while also reducing the financial burden. Pursuing higher education abroad can open up numerous opportunities for personal and professional growth.
26/2/24, 8:41 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
26/2/24, 8:43 AM - +263 78 121 2611: Yes indeed
26/2/24, 8:46 AM - +263 78 121 2611: Gain industry experience and bridging the gap between academic learning and real world employment
26/2/24, 8:51 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
26/2/24, 8:51 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
26/2/24, 8:51 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
26/2/24, 8:56 AM - +263 78 121 2611: Noted ✍🏽
26/2/24, 8:57 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
26/2/24, 8:57 AM - +263 78 121 2611: Okay thank you
26/2/24, 8:58 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
26/2/24, 8:58 AM - +263 78 121 2611: Yes
26/2/24, 9:01 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.
26/2/24, 9:01 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/2/24, 9:01 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/2/24, 9:09 AM - +263 78 121 2611: This is interesting
26/2/24, 9:11 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
26/2/24, 9:12 AM - +263 78 121 2611: Yes it is
26/2/24, 9:14 AM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
26/2/24, 9:15 AM - +263 78 121 2611: Perfect
26/2/24, 9:16 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
26/2/24, 9:16 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube

4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is.
26/2/24, 9:29 AM - +263 78 121 2611: 1. On my EWYL team we have Ms.Sanjana who is the head of Department and we also have MS.Davi who is the head coach
2.My mentor has set the following goals
*make sure that my academic journey is great
*ensure that am given enough opportunities to self finance my higher education in lndia
*to work towards attaining the objective that l am learning and evolving with the relevant 21st century skills to prepare me for the real world workplace and help me grow holistically
3.A
4.The Hall of inspiration it makes students who were once not able to do certain things to do them and also helps in attaining ones skills
26/2/24, 9:30 AM - Aditi Edoofa: This is fantastic!
26/2/24, 9:30 AM - +263 78 121 2611: Thank you

4/3/24, 12:56 PM - +263 78 121 2611: Cooperate alliance
The objective is to gain an understanding of the market and start preparing it for the future . 
One have to reach to many companies and tell them how Edoofa is helping to develop necessary skills for future employment after graduation .It's better to start with people close by.
5/3/24, 1:40 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good afternoon!
Hope you are well.

Are you ready for the session?🚀

5/3/24, 2:07 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *I think we’re ready to move to the community building project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share an audio file from our mentorship team and you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it!
5/3/24, 2:07 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/3/24, 2:08 PM - +263 78 121 2611: Okay

5/3/24, 2:28 PM - +263 78 121 2611: Community building refers to the process of establishing and strengthening connections , relationships and sharing ideas with a group or community. It promotes social interaction and participation in some responsibility and ownership . It helps edoofians learn how to liberate children through social media to offer African children to become part of Edoofa .
5/3/24, 2:32 PM - +263 78 121 2611: It encourages children to have a mindset of identifying opportunities and sharing them to create an impact in the life of others . To successfully reach this project students have to reach out to students who recently graduated from their senior secondary school or are currently in their final year of secondary education.
5/3/24, 2:40 PM - Aditi Edoofa: That’s awesome, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.


1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!

5/3/24, 2:43 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
5/3/24, 2:44 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*HAPPINESS/ADITI*
5/3/24, 2:44 PM - +263 78 121 2611: Noted
5/3/24, 2:48 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
5/3/24, 2:48 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
5/3/24, 2:48 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *ADD MENTOR:*

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

5/3/24, 2:52 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
5/3/24, 2:52 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
