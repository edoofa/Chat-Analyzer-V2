6/1/24, 1:38 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello @263718137664 

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of *our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs*, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:38 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
11/1/24, 4:18 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hellooooo!!!!

I quickly just wanted to share the scoop on *Slice Con'24—it was seriously awesome!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️

Hope you are well.

I've noticed that you've left my messages on "Seen" without responding.
Your responsibility as a mentee includes actively engaging in conversations, seeking guidance when needed, and keeping me updated on your progress. Ignoring messages, even unintentionally, can hinder our ability to work together effectively and achieve your goals.
26/2/24, 10:11 AM - +263 71 813 7664: Good morning mam 
I made a mistake I replied to Mr Austin directly and thought had send the message to this group pardon me
26/2/24, 10:11 AM - +263 71 813 7664: The event was a fantastic ,,Well we would like to send our sincere gratitude for having us 🤝 . My mother didn't attend the event because she wasn't feeling well but she had a number of questions which are 
1. How do you handle the issues concerning the scholarship percentage ?
2 . What if my offer letters 15 days were due already 
3. Are my scholarship percentage going to be affected by the ESAT exam or by my Advanced level results 
I don't know how best can I explain these to her maybe you can help 
Thank You 🤝
26/2/24, 10:23 AM - +263 71 813 7664: As for my understanding I've known that the  ESAT exam was an opportunity set for us to win 100% scholarships is it ? And also I  haven't been given any scholarship percentage yet maybe because my ALEVEL results were not out or maybe because EDOOFA rarely talks about percentage scholarships ?! What's correct mam please help <This message was edited>
26/2/24, 10:39 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you for your kind words, and we're glad to hear that you found the event fantastic!
