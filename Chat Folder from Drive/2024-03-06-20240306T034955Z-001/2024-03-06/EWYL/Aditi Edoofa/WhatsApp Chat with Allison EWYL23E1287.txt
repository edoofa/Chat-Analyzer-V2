29/2/24, 2:29 PM - +263 71 669 8958: My long term goals are I want to get a degree in BA-LLB and focus on co operate law. By the time I attain my goals and a degree in BA-LLB I will be able to deal with the formation and operation of business and and the laws that must be followed.

29/2/24, 2:45 PM - +263 71 669 8958: Ok..., thank you.
29/2/24, 2:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
29/2/24, 2:47 PM - +263 71 669 8958: No..., you can explain.
29/2/24, 2:48 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
29/2/24, 2:48 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
29/2/24, 2:50 PM - +263 71 669 8958: Ooooh, ok. I understand.
29/2/24, 3:02 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
29/2/24, 3:03 PM - +263 71 669 8958: Ok...., so they are in this group as well?
29/2/24, 3:04 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Yes!
29/2/24, 3:05 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The session time has concluded for now, we will meet tomorrow for our session at the same time, so make sure you are on time.⌛
29/2/24, 3:06 PM - +263 71 669 8958: Ok..., seize the day.
1/3/24, 1:34 PM - +263 71 669 8958: Good afternoon...., I am ready for the session, we can proceed.
1/3/24, 1:38 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Happy New Month🌸!
Hope you are doing well.

So are you ready for today's session?🚀
1/3/24, 1:39 PM - +263 71 669 8958: Thank you and same..... Yes I am ready for the session.
1/3/24, 1:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you and Great!
1/3/24, 1:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
1/3/24, 1:50 PM - +263 71 669 8958: Yeah.., it sounds very interesting.
1/3/24, 2:28 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

5/3/24, 1:45 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
5/3/24, 1:49 PM - +263 71 669 8958: Yeah it's good. I  really did get inspired to work.
5/3/24, 2:00 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Awesome!
5/3/24, 2:00 PM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:

2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
5/3/24, 2:06 PM - +263 71 669 8958: It sounds great.., that's good. Thank you.
5/3/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
5/3/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/3/24, 2:17 PM - +263 71 669 8958: Yes it's understandable.
5/3/24, 2:27 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
5/3/24, 2:56 PM - +263 71 669 8958: I have finished reading the document.
5/3/24, 3:00 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The current session has come to an end. Let's reconvene tomorrow at the same time for our next session. Please ensure that you're punctual. ⌛
