27/12/23, 8:51 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Indeed! It will! <This message was edited>
27/12/23, 8:52 AM - Aditi Edoofa: @263715622820  I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
27/12/23, 8:52 AM - +263 77 687 8739: Thank you so much
27/12/23, 8:54 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!
27/12/23, 9:00 AM - +263 71 562 2820: Ok so in my life ,my only dream is to change my present life into a better and wonderful one .I want to be a doctor as I have the passion in the healthy sector .I also want to put my parents into greener pastures and also to serve people in the world .In my own point of view I think the EWYL program will help me in several ways .Despite the redundancy in my university fees ,this program will also help me to experience other activities of life .After the EWYL program ,I just assume that I will be a good employee and a better leader of tomorrow .
27/12/23, 9:02 AM - Aditi Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear about your aspirations and dreams. The desire to become a doctor and contribute to the healthcare sector while also improving the lives of your parents is truly commendable. The EWYL program appears to be a significant opportunity for you to not only address the financial challenges related to university fees but also to gain diverse life experiences.

Participating in the EWYL program could potentially equip you with valuable skills and perspectives that extend beyond academics. It seems you anticipate that the program will play a crucial role in shaping you into a competent employee and a future leader. Your positive outlook and determination are admirable, and I hope the EWYL journey brings you closer to realizing your dreams.🚀❤️ <This message was edited>
27/12/23, 9:03 AM - +263 71 562 2820: Ofcourse ma'am
27/12/23, 9:06 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
27/12/23, 9:08 AM - +263 71 562 2820: Mmm a I am not certain about the two keys but I guess one of it is to make students achieve their goals and be good future leaders
27/12/23, 9:09 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay.
27/12/23, 9:09 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
27/12/23, 9:09 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
27/12/23, 9:10 AM - +263 71 562 2820: Well noted ma'am
27/12/23, 9:12 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
27/12/23, 9:13 AM - +263 71 562 2820: Nice to now ma'am thank you
27/12/23, 9:14 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
27/12/23, 9:16 AM - +263 71 562 2820: Yes
27/12/23, 9:16 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.
27/12/23, 9:17 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

27/12/23, 9:23 AM - Aditi Edoofa: @263715622820 Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
27/12/23, 9:24 AM - +263 71 562 2820: Yes it is
27/12/23, 9:25 AM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound ?

29/12/23, 8:37 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
29/12/23, 8:37 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.

2/1/24, 9:03 AM - +263 77 687 8739: Great
2/1/24, 9:05 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
2/1/24, 9:05 AM - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*BENJAMIN/ADITI*
2/1/24, 9:05 AM - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
2/1/24, 9:05 AM - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
2/1/24, 9:06 AM - Aditi Edoofa: ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

2/1/24, 9:09 AM - +263 77 687 8739: Well noted
2/1/24, 9:12 AM - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
2/1/24, 9:12 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

I am so sorry for my absence yesterday there was no network at all

5/1/24, 8:38 AM - +263 77 687 8739: Yes ma'am
5/1/24, 8:39 AM - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

I wish you a wonderful weekend ahead!🌺
6/1/24, 1:19 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of *our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs,* showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:20 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
11/1/24, 8:17 AM - +263 77 687 8739: <Media omitted>
11/1/24, 8:34 AM - +263 77 687 8739: Morning ma'am
11/1/24, 9:28 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Benjamin, good morning!
I hope all is okay with you.

I'm happy to let you know that I've returned from the industrial visit, where I sadly missed a lot of our sessions. I apologize for missing our 8:30 AM session; rest assured, though, as I promised to share the pictures with you as soon as possible. Our session has been rescheduled from 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM, so please confirm your availability.
11/1/24, 9:29 AM - +263 77 687 8739: I am OK ma'am
11/1/24, 9:29 AM - +263 77 687 8739: I will be available and I can't wait to see the pictures
11/1/24, 9:31 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Awesome!
11/1/24, 1:32 PM - +263 77 687 8739: Good afternoon ma'am
11/1/24, 1:32 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So are you ready for today's session?🚀
11/1/24, 1:32 PM - +263 77 687 8739: Yes
11/1/24, 1:35 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
Please note a few things:
FIRST- Your Sessions will be on *TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
11/1/24, 1:35 PM - +263 77 687 8739: Noted
11/1/24, 1:47 PM - Aditi Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days you will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
11/1/24, 1:47 PM - Aditi Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
11/1/24, 1:48 PM - Aditi Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
11/1/24, 1:49 PM - +263 77 687 8739: Well noted
11/1/24, 1:50 PM - Aditi Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Aditi, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
11/1/24, 1:50 PM - Aditi Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
11/1/24, 1:50 PM - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
11/1/24, 1:53 PM - +263 77 687 8739: Well noted ma'am
11/1/24, 1:55 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Your session is on Tuesday and Friday from 09:30-11:00 AM. In your session, you are required to:
▪️Active participation in most of the sessions by being punctual and actively engaging in the discussions
▪️Follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' on the EWYL Line every day, every morning before 12 PM.
▪️Share your lesson and activity response before your session commences
▪️Sharing project updates
11/1/24, 1:55 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
11/1/24, 1:56 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Benjamin, that concludes our initial orientation. I trust that you've gained valuable insights and anticipate that there will be more to come as we progress towards achieving great success. Our next point of contact will be on the EWYL Line during your scheduled sessions and will follow the Proud Edoofian ritual daily.
11/1/24, 1:56 PM - +263 77 687 8739: So I can do it now?
11/1/24, 1:57 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Yes!
11/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 77 687 8739: Ok
11/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 77 687 8739: Great

I quickly just wanted to share the scoop on *Slice Con'24—it was seriously awesome!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️

20/2/24, 4:56 PM - +263 71 562 2820: So as I was at the event I was so excited to physically meet the Edoofa team .The team was so free and responsible as they  gave us good hospitality. The coordinators were so amazing as they were working with us Willingly. As I was listening  ,I've learnt different aspects of being a good hardworking student ad well as an employee. There's this other former student who was there who've shared his experience with us .I did cough some of his words when he said "If you go to study in India under Edoofa ,it's not all about having a good certificate but rather having a good experience in what ever job you wish to take "with these words I've noticed that being an EDOOFIAN is a perfect chance of gaining great experiences of being a good employee. Other Co-founders have also shared words of wisdom with us and they were mostly  concerned without hardwork. It was a pleasure to meet the team in reality and this boosted my trust and hope in you.Now I can confidentiality say I AM A PROUD EDOOFIAN. Different videos of students in India were shared an we've noticed  that Edoofa is Home away from home. I was so excited as after I heard that students are given chances to learn from different business men from different parts of the world .I was so delighted to know that the CEO of the WORLD  WIDE WEBSITE  (GOOGLE)is from India.
21/2/24, 11:15 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Benjamin,

Thank you for sharing your experience with us, and I'm thrilled to hear that you had such a positive and inspiring time at the event. It's wonderful that you had the opportunity to physically meet the Edoofa team and found them to be welcoming and responsible, providing excellent hospitality.

Learning about different aspects of being a hardworking student and employee is invaluable, and it's great to hear that you gained insights from the former student's experience. His words about the importance of gaining experience resonated with you, and I'm glad that it reaffirmed your confidence in being an Edoofian. <This message was edited>
21/2/24, 11:15 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The wisdom shared by the co-founders, particularly about the value of hard work, must have been enlightening. It's fantastic that meeting the team in person boosted your trust and hope in Edoofa, allowing you to proudly declare yourself as a Edoofian.

The videos of students in India showcasing Edoofa as a home away from home and the opportunities to learn from business leaders worldwide must have been exciting. Knowing that the CEO of Google is from India is truly inspiring and underscores the potential for growth and success that awaits Edoofians.

I couldn't take your sessions as I was unwell, I am feeling better now and I am anticipating your presence at the EWYL Line for our session. Please ensure that you are on time for your sessions.
