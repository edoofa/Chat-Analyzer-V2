17/2/24, 9:02 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning Lenon!

While we were having multiple conversations with our students in the past few days for the meet & greet event, we figured that there is a slight confusion in the invitation dates. Hence, I wanted to quickly reach out and ensure that the same is not the case with you.

- As per the invitation, *you* are supposed to attend the event along with your parents on *19th of February* which is Monday.
 
- If you are recommending any of *your friends (Non Edoofians)* along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for *18th of February (8am/1pm) or 19th February(1pm)*. They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event.
17/2/24, 9:02 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Please ensure that you are present at the venue 30 minutes earlier and are dressed appropriately.
Don't forget to carry your admit card!

Hope you are well.

I am looking forward to your response to my above message.

Team Edoofa experienced a whirlwind over the past three days, with activities bustling in both India and Harare for the Meet and Greet '24 event. After a brief moment to collect ourselves, we're ready to return to our original schedule and move forward in our journey. 
*Our session will commence today at 8:30 AM.*
22/2/24, 8:28 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So let's begin with today's session🚀

22/2/24, 2:10 PM - +263 77 399 7978: I see us dealing with two universities here...Desh Bagat & Galgotias universities.

26/2/24, 9:39 AM - Aditi Edoofa: We are concluding today's session. We will reconvene tomorrow for our session.🚀
26/2/24, 10:50 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I've noticed that you've left my message on "Seen" without responding.
Your responsibility as a mentee includes actively engaging in conversations, seeking guidance when needed, and keeping me updated on your progress. Ignoring messages, even unintentionally, can hinder our ability to work together effectively and achieve your goals.
27/2/24, 9:57 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning Lenon!
Hope you are well.

Please excuse me as I was unable to take your session as it coincided with a team meeting. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. Thank you for your understanding.
28/2/24, 7:57 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning Lenon!
Hope you are well.

During my discussion with Mr. Angad today, I realized the need for more efficient and effective sessions with my students to expedite our progress.

In light of this, I have decided to reschedule our sessions to Monday through Friday from 1:30 PM to 3:00 PM. This schedule change will ensure more productive sessions, and I look forward to seeing you today at the new time!
28/2/24, 8:34 AM - +263 77 399 7978: Sorry , the boy is today travelling back home from Harare....I think he will contact you as soon as he completes his journey. I hope this will not inconvenience your programs.
28/2/24, 3:11 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I understand. Thank you for letting me know.
29/2/24, 1:34 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon!☀️
Hope you are well.

Are you ready for the session?🚀
29/2/24, 1:48 PM - +263 78 221 4255: Today I am ready and available
29/2/24, 2:01 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
29/2/24, 2:02 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
29/2/24, 2:17 PM - +263 78 221 4255: In the long term, I look forward to spearheading new advances in improving the effeciency of electrical systems overally to reduce the cost of electricity supply in households and also reduce strain on national and international power supply grids. I think Edoofa will go a long way in helping me to achieve this goal by allowing me to experience, first hand, how other nations, especially large ones like india, are dealing and coping with the power crisis overally around the world.
29/2/24, 2:26 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Your long-term goal of spearheading advancements to enhance the efficiency of electrical systems and reduce the cost of electricity supply is both ambitious and impactful.

Participating in the Edoofa program will indeed provide valuable opportunities for firsthand experience and learning, especially from nations like India, which face similar challenges with power supply and management. Experiencing different approaches and strategies used in various parts of the world will undoubtedly broaden your understanding and perspective, equipping you with the knowledge and insights needed to make meaningful contributions towards your goal.

Your dedication to addressing global issues such as the power crisis is commendable, and I am confident that with the experiences and skills gained through the Edoofa program.
29/2/24, 2:27 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
29/2/24, 2:31 PM - +263 78 221 4255: Please remind me of the same
29/2/24, 2:48 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
29/2/24, 2:48 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
29/2/24, 3:11 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The session time has concluded for now, we will meet tomorrow for our session at the same time, so make sure you are on time.⌛
29/2/24, 3:15 PM - +263 78 221 4255: Duly noted
1/3/24, 1:40 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Happy New Month🌸!
Hope you are doing well.

So are you ready for today's session?🚀
1/3/24, 2:39 PM - +263 78 221 4255: Sorry for the delay. I am ready now
1/3/24, 2:49 PM - Aditi Edoofa: @263782214255 May I know why you are late for the session?
1/3/24, 3:06 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Today's session concludes here. 
Please note that there are no sessions scheduled for Saturday and Sunday.
 Our next session will take place on Monday. 
I wish you a wonderful weekend ahead!🌺
5/3/24, 1:39 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good afternoon!
Hope you are well.

Are you ready for the session?🚀
5/3/24, 1:41 PM - +263 78 221 4255: Yes
5/3/24, 1:51 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
5/3/24, 1:52 PM - +263 78 221 4255: Noted
5/3/24, 2:02 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
5/3/24, 2:03 PM - +263 78 221 4255: Very interesting. Carry on
5/3/24, 2:11 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

5/3/24, 2:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/3/24, 2:25 PM - +263 78 221 4255: I have finished reading the newsletters
5/3/24, 2:29 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great, Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
5/3/24, 2:31 PM - +263 78 221 4255: It is. And I am confident that they will soon be reading about me in that section as well. However, this was not my favorite part of the newsletters... I especially liked the inspirational quotes at the beginning.
5/3/24, 2:37 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Ohh that's nice!
5/3/24, 2:38 PM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
5/3/24, 2:42 PM - +263 78 221 4255: That sounds good to me. Thank you
5/3/24, 2:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you.
