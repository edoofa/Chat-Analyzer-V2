22/2/24, 8:04 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning Mary!
Hope you are well.

Team Edoofa experienced a whirlwind over the past three days, with activities bustling in both India and Harare for the Meet and Greet '24 event. After a brief moment to collect ourselves, we're ready to return to our original schedule and move forward in our journey. 
*Our session will commence today at 8:30 AM.*
22/2/24, 8:28 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So let's begin with today's session🚀
22/2/24, 8:33 AM - +263 71 784 1345: Morning .We can start
22/2/24, 8:35 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
22/2/24, 8:36 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So Mary, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
22/2/24, 8:41 AM - +263 71 784 1345: I want to be a successful lawyer and with the EWYL Program l believe it will help me to lessen the expenses of the tution fee making it also easier for my parents.
22/2/24, 8:44 AM - Aditi Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear about your ambition to become a successful lawyer! Pursuing a career in law is a noble endeavor, and it's great that you're exploring ways to make it more manageable financially, especially for your parents. The EWYL Program can indeed be a valuable resource in this regard, helping to alleviate the burden of tuition expenses and making your educational journey smoother.

By participating in programs like EWYL, you're not only investing in your own future but also lightening the load for your loved ones. Keep focusing on your goals, and remember that dedication and perseverance are key to achieving success in the field of law.
22/2/24, 8:44 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
22/2/24, 8:49 AM - +263 71 784 1345: What are the objectives.
22/2/24, 8:53 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
22/2/24, 8:53 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
22/2/24, 8:54 AM - +263 71 784 1345: Thank you for the enlightenment.
22/2/24, 8:57 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
22/2/24, 9:00 AM - +263 71 784 1345: An delighted to know the Edoofa family.
22/2/24, 9:02 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
22/2/24, 9:04 AM - +263 71 784 1345: Very interesting
22/2/24, 9:07 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

22/2/24, 9:12 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
22/2/24, 9:17 AM - +263 71 784 1345: It is
22/2/24, 9:21 AM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
22/2/24, 9:22 AM - +263 71 784 1345: Fantastic
22/2/24, 9:25 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
22/2/24, 9:25 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

28/2/24, 2:08 PM - Aditi Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
28/2/24, 2:08 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

28/2/24, 2:20 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, that’s wonderful. I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
28/2/24, 2:36 PM - +263 71 784 1345: l understood that there are  three activities which are Corporate alliances
,Community Building
 and African Schools Education Reform Mission                           


FROM PROJECT 1,i understood that the students identify companies or organisations. Once identified, they need to find decision makers within these companies or organisations and introduce them to edoofa's vision, mission and work .The student then arrange a video call meeting between Edoofa and the organisation .If both sides agree to get into a contract,the signing of the contract will be facilitated                                                               FROM PROJECT 2. I understood that at this project , Edofians  will be reaching out to their personal and extended networks. Edoofians should act as super networkers and use persuasion skills to convince other students to join Edoofa family. The aim is to offer these students an opportunity to be   part of Edoofa educational ecosystem that prepares them for future.  When persuaded students are enroll and pay enrollment fee, the edofian will earn scholarship credits.                                                     3.FROM PROJECT 3.I understood that Edoofians are assigned the task of establishing a connection between senior secondary schools and Edoofa . They reach out to various schools and assist in forming partnership with Edoofa. the identification of partnerships will occur through LinkedIn and the student's personal network
28/2/24, 2:37 PM - Aditi Edoofa: This is amazing
28/2/24, 2:38 PM - Aditi Edoofa: This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
28/2/24, 2:38 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
28/2/24, 2:38 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

28/2/24, 2:49 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, that’s wonderful. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above audio.
28/2/24, 2:55 PM - +263 71 784 1345: My task is to identify companies that are technologically driven within my country. I will start by explaining to them my objectives and how Edoofa is helping me to develop the necessary skills for future employment.In order to reach out to professionals within the companies,I have to create a LinkedIn account or download a LinkedIn app.Through LinkedIn,I will be able to reach out to managers of the companies and initiate conservation to set up calls  with Edoofa. I will have to share the core details with Edoofa .
28/2/24, 2:58 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Fantastic!

Please note that there are no sessions scheduled for Saturday and Sunday.
 Our next session will take place on Monday. 
I wish you a wonderful weekend ahead!🌺
5/3/24, 1:39 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good afternoon!
Hope you are well.

Are you ready for the session?🚀
5/3/24, 1:39 PM - +263 71 784 1345: I am ready.
5/3/24, 1:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
5/3/24, 1:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*MARY/ADITI*
5/3/24, 1:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
5/3/24, 1:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
5/3/24, 1:47 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *ADD MENTOR:*

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

5/3/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: He can specially mention that.
5/3/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
5/3/24, 2:16 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
