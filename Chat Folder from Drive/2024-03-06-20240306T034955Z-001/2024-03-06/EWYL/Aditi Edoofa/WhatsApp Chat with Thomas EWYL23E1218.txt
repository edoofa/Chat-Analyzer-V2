Additionally, if you have captured any memorable moments in photos, we would greatly appreciate you sharing them.

22/2/24, 7:58 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning Thomas!
Hope you are well.

Team Edoofa experienced a whirlwind over the past three days, with activities bustling in both India and Harare for the Meet and Greet '24 event. After a brief moment to collect ourselves, we're ready to return to our original schedule and move forward in our journey. 
*Our session will commence today at 8:30 AM.*
22/2/24, 8:28 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So let's begin with today's session🚀
22/2/24, 8:58 AM - +263 78 746 3056: Sorry for coming late but we may start if it is okay with you and if time permits
22/2/24, 9:01 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Sure! May I know why you are late?
22/2/24, 9:13 AM - +263 78 746 3056: Ok so lam at school and l was having a lesson at that particular time
22/2/24, 9:17 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, so may I know if you will be available from 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM for your session?
22/2/24, 9:19 AM - +263 78 746 3056: Yes l will be available
22/2/24, 9:24 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great, then we will resume our session from today onwards from 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM.
22/2/24, 9:38 AM - +263 78 746 3056: Ok thank you
22/2/24, 1:27 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So let's begin with today's session🚀
22/2/24, 1:32 PM - +263 78 746 3056: Yes we may begin
22/2/24, 1:36 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So we will begin from here, I hope everything is clear till this point.
22/2/24, 1:38 PM - +263 78 746 3056: Yes indeed ,everything is clear
22/2/24, 1:41 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
22/2/24, 1:41 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
22/2/24, 1:43 PM - +263 78 746 3056: Well understood thank you for the emphasis
22/2/24, 1:47 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
22/2/24, 1:50 PM - +263 78 746 3056: Ok thank you for introducing them so that l get to know them
22/2/24, 1:51 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
22/2/24, 1:52 PM - +263 78 746 3056: Yes it sounds interersting
22/2/24, 1:55 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

26/2/24, 2:08 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
