5/3/24, 2:39 PM - Aditi Edoofa: It's fantastic to hear about your long-term goal of becoming a successful accountant. Pursuing a bachelor's degree in accounting and gaining relevant experience in the field are crucial steps toward achieving that goal.

It's great that you see the EWYL program as a valuable piece of the puzzle in your journey to becoming a chartered accountant and a businesswoman. The program can offer you not only practical knowledge and skills but also support in passing exams and advancing in your career.

Keep your focus on your aspirations, and continue to leverage opportunities like the EWYL program to enhance your skills and knowledge. With dedication and determination, you're well on your way to achieving success in your chosen field.
5/3/24, 2:39 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
5/3/24, 2:41 PM - +263 78 583 1530: Not quite
5/3/24, 2:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
5/3/24, 2:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
