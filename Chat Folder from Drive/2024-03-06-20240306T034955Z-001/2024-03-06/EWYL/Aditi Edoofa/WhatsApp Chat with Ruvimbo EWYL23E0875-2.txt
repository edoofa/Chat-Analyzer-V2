While we were having multiple conversations with our students in the past few days for the meet & greet event, we figured that there is a slight confusion in the invitation dates. Hence, I wanted to quickly reach out and ensure that the same is not the case with you.

- As per the invitation, *you* are supposed to attend the event along with your parents on *19th of February* which is Monday.
 
- If you are recommending any of *your friends (Non Edoofians)* along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for *18th of February (8am/1pm) or 19th February(1pm)*. They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event.
17/2/24, 9:00 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Please ensure that you are present at the venue 30 minutes earlier and are dressed appropriately.
Don't forget to carry your admit card!

Cannot wait to see you there tomorrow! Hope you're excited too! 😃🕺🏻
17/2/24, 9:02 AM - +263 78 779 7357: Morning mam OK thank you so much will be looking forward to see you too 😇
17/2/24, 10:10 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Just a Correction, we will see you there on Monday, *19th February 2024*.
17/2/24, 11:07 AM - +263 78 779 7357: Alright mam🥰
18/2/24, 10:13 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning Ruvimbo!

20/2/24, 2:34 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Ruvimbo!

The past three days flew by in a whirlwind for Team Edoofa – both for those in India and those in Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. Now that we've had a chance to catch our breath, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success.

Your insights from the event are highly valued, and I'm keen to hear about your experience. Would you be open to sharing your thoughts, including your interest in attending similar events in the future and any suggestions for improvement? Additionally, if you have captured any memorable moments in photos, we would greatly appreciate you sharing them.

Your perspective is crucial, and I also encourage you to discuss the event with your parents and gather their feedback.
20/2/24, 2:34 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, we will surely meet when you are here in India.
20/2/24, 4:08 PM - +263 78 779 7357: Greetings mam the event was so great we got to watch videos that really inspired us that whatever that we were doing is real and I'm not just getting any degree but I'm also gonna acquire unique skills that not every student or intern can get . My parents do no longer have any benefit of doubt with Edoofa. It was a nice experience because I met other Edoofians whom I will be going with . We couldn't take pictures because after the exam yooh you know😂😂😂 wasn't expecting some biology questions because I last did Biology in O level and was doing physics A level . I wish they would have made the event longer 😇
21/2/24, 11:08 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Ruvimbo,

I'm thrilled to hear that you had such a great experience at the event! It's wonderful that the videos inspired you and reassured you about the value of the education and skills you'll acquire through Edoofa. I'm glad to hear that your parents are now fully on board as well.

Meeting other Edoofians who will be accompanying you on this journey must have been a fantastic experience. I understand that the exam afterward might have been unexpected, especially with questions from subjects you haven't studied recently.

Your feedback about the event's duration is duly noted, and we'll keep that in mind for future events. We want to ensure that all participants have enough time to fully engage and benefit from the experience.
21/2/24, 11:16 AM - +263 78 779 7357: Thank you mam😇
26/2/24, 6:40 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good evening, Ruvimbo!

I can feel your excitement buzzing through the screen as you await your *ESAT results!* Hold onto that anticipation just a bit longer because we're about to drop the big news in sometime! 🎉

Mark your calendars for *Friday, March 1st* – that's when we will be unveiling your results. Get ready to celebrate your achievements and embrace the possibilities that lie ahead! 🌟

*Let's keep our fingers crossed! All the best* 👍🏻
