6/1/24, 1:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Chantel

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of *our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs*, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨

11/1/24, 4:23 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hellooooo!!!!

I quickly just wanted to share the scoop on *Slice Con'24—it was seriously awesome!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️

*Are you tired of connecting with us only through screens?*
Well, now is the time! Guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – just like last year, this month, we're planning an annual and exclusive meet & greet in Africa! 🌍 However, this time it’s different! It’s a mega event that has never happened in the history of Zimbabwe, as we are expecting a crowd of 5000 people! Surprising, isn't it?🤩

Now, we understand that you and your parents must have a lot of questions in your mind as you are in the middle of your University admission process. Therefore, keeping this in mind, along with Mr. Angad, our admissions team, and our counselors will be there as well to address all of your concerns!🚀 <This message was edited>
1/2/24, 4:01 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, bring your parents along, and don't miss your chance to expedite your admission process. Not only that, get ready to dive into the opportunities you are going to experience when you are here in India, as Mr. Angad himself is going to walk you through the journey of being an Edoofian. After all, only 6 months are left! So, get ready for this epic adventure, and I'll share the details with you super soon! ⚡

*By the way, we'd like to reserve your seats in advance. Could you please let us know how many people you'll be coming with? This will help us allocate the right number of slots for you.*
2/2/24, 6:49 AM - +263 78 864 6190: It’s great that you are inviting parents as well, because I know they are super curious about all the details and have a ton of questions. And you got me excited about Mr. Angad himself sharing details about being an Edoofian. I really hope to see what this journey is all about! It really looks like a fun and adventurous journey ahead, and we're looking forward to it. 😀

While we were having multiple conversations with our students in the past few days for the meet & greet event, we figured that there is a slight confusion in the invitation dates. Hence, I wanted to quickly reach out and ensure that the same is not the case with you.

- As per the invitation, *you* are supposed to attend the event along with your parents on *19th of February* which is Monday.
 
- If you are recommending any of *your friends (Non Edoofians)* along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for *18th of February (8am/1pm) or 19th February(1pm)*. They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event.
17/2/24, 9:01 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Please ensure that you are present at the venue 30 minutes earlier and are dressed appropriately.

l really had a good time. l went with parents and a friend.
 l was very happy to meet the Edoofa team and they really explained very well that all my questions were answered. l also had a chance of watching the video of the students that are already in India. That made me really trust the program and knowing that they are very happy .l am really sure l will also have a good time in India. l also had a chance to talk to Tirivashe and yaaaaa he told me a lot about India. l was also afraid about racism but because of yesterday am at peace. l also meet some students who are going to the same university and we exchange numbers. This was really an amazing event .Thank you for organising such an event.

Hope you are well.

I am so happy to hear that you had such a wonderful time at the event! It sounds like it was a truly enriching experience for you. Meeting the Edoofa team and having all your questions answered must have provided valuable clarity and reassurance as you prepare for your journey to India.
Watching the video of students already in India and seeing their happiness must have been incredibly reassuring and motivating. It's great to hear that you feel confident about your own upcoming experience in India. <This message was edited>
21/2/24, 10:30 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Having the opportunity to talk to Tirivashe and learn more about India from him must have been insightful and comforting, especially regarding concerns about racism. I'm glad that the event helped alleviate those fears for you.
It's fantastic that you were able to connect with other students who will be attending the same university and exchange contact information. Building those connections will surely enrich your experience even further.

Thank you for your kind words about the event, and I'm delighted that it was such a positive experience for you. 🚀
