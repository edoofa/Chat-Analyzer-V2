Your insights from the event are highly valued, and I'm keen to hear about your experience. Would you be open to sharing your thoughts, including your interest in attending similar events in the future and any suggestions for improvement?

Hope you are well.

I am looking forward to your response on my above message.
21/2/24, 11:48 AM - +263 77 634 9467: Good morning 
First and foremost l would like to thank the Edoofian team for granting us as students the opportunity of attending such an event and I do really look forward to attending other events similar to the one I attended.Honestly there are no suggestions for improvement as for me because everything was just good and up to standard..I actually got to get a clear picture of how Edoofa operates and how they are helping us as African students to acquire education and also to reach greater heights and also fulfill our dreams.It was such an honor to meet the whole board including the Founder Mr Angad Singh who shared with us his experiences through out these years and up to now and how he is so keen on making Education a part of each and every youth as he believes the youth are the most productive in society which will help Africa as a continent to prosper also just like other continents...as a result of all that was shared on that day i actually got an eye opener on how our parents can fully invest in our Education while we study in local universities but yet after attaining our degrees we will be yet unemployed so edoofa is more like a bridge giving students access to education and also access to employment which acts as an advantage as the unemployment challenge will be solved ..Through it all I actually got to develop more enthusiasm and energy as it all proved to be those characteristics that employees look into when hiring and also it helps one reach his goals ..I really did learn alot some of it I might not be able to express it but just know I am now so eager to embark on this journey and also I am really looking forward to coming to India inorder to pursue my Education inorder for me to fulfill my goals and also my parent's wishes
21/2/24, 3:10 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you for your heartfelt message. It's wonderful to hear about your positive experience at the event and your enthusiasm for the opportunities that Edoofa provides. Mr. Angad Singh's vision for empowering African youth through education is truly inspiring, and it's clear that his dedication has resonated with you. The realization of how Edoofa can serve as a bridge between education and employment is indeed powerful, and it's heartening to see your eagerness to embark on this journey. We're excited to support you every step of the way as you pursue your education and work towards fulfilling your goals.

27/2/24, 1:47 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So @263781558940 can you share what you have retained till now from the EWYL Sessions so that we can resume from that point?
27/2/24, 1:49 PM - +263 78 155 8940: Honestly I thought we hadn't begun yet because we haven't done anything except you giving me a heads up for the important notices
27/2/24, 1:50 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, no worries. So let's begin.
27/2/24, 1:50 PM - Aditi Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of.

27/2/24, 2:27 PM - +263 78 155 8940: I did understand that through the Earn while you learn program I will not only be able to achieve my career goals and secure the future but rather I will gain Awareness and not only Awareness because it is not enough to help us in securing our future goals but rather taking action will .Taking action requires attaing skills and these skills include skills that are merging like Online /Digital skills and literacy and also Skills that are enduring which include relationship building and also I gained knowledge on how I will be putting all these into actions inorder for me to gain scholarship credits at the end of each project that i though roughly complete

29/2/24, 1:55 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
29/2/24, 1:55 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/2/24, 2:06 PM - +263 78 155 8940: From the document I understood that inorder for one to be able to search for good companies they have things to consider like the nature of the company is it school centric for example or.is it recreational..
Also one has to look at the scale of the company which doesn't have to be too big or too small
Then also financial stability of thar certain company is another guide line and also research on the founders background does help in searching for companies ...then also upon completing these one can do more research on the company to check how they operate and how they work and also when one communicates with the companies one can start up with the Marketing manager without starting with the founders which is beneficial inorder to gather information
29/2/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: You know what, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.

So are you ready for today's session?🚀
1/3/24, 1:39 PM - +27 62 323 6383: Good afternoon
1/3/24, 1:39 PM - +263 78 155 8940: Thank you 
I am doing just fine 
And yes I'm ready
1/3/24, 1:42 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
1/3/24, 1:42 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *Now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it!
1/3/24, 1:42 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
1/3/24, 1:50 PM - +263 78 155 8940: Understood
1/3/24, 2:27 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
1/3/24, 2:39 PM - +263 78 155 8940: So to sum up i learnt that the second project is all about Community building which is almost the foundation of each edoofian ..which is crucial as it creates a cohesive environment fit for one to feel comfortable and actually is fit for those people who share certain goals or agendas.which in turn is positive as social interaction is enhanced.Through all this i as an an edoofian student will gain skills through connecting other African students who are interested in acquiring higher education and this is for students who have finished higher secondary education .and I will use community building as a way to help them acquire the necessary information on how Edoofa works for them to be part of the team and above it all I will earn scholarship credits through by having these students who are interested contacting the Edoofa team and wanting to be apart of the whole team inorder for the group to grow
1/3/24, 2:50 PM - Aditi Edoofa: That’s awesome, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.


1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

5/3/24, 1:52 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
5/3/24, 1:52 PM - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
5/3/24, 1:53 PM - +263 78 155 8940: Understood
5/3/24, 2:02 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
5/3/24, 2:02 PM - Aditi Edoofa: -*A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*KIMBERLY/ADITI*
5/3/24, 2:02 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
5/3/24, 2:03 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
5/3/24, 2:03 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *ADD MENTOR:*

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

5/3/24, 2:07 PM - +263 78 155 8940: Understood
5/3/24, 2:16 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
5/3/24, 2:16 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Herewith I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.
