6/1/24, 1:40 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello @263773112014 

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of *our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs*, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:40 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
9/1/24, 3:27 AM - +263 77 311 2014: Great then
11/1/24, 4:16 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hellooooo!!!!

I quickly just wanted to share the scoop on *Slice Con'24—it was seriously awesome!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️

23/1/24, 9:07 AM - Aditi Edoofa: *_🌟 URGENT UPDATE 🌟_*

Guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

In light of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. *Today, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable* and I am confident that together, we will create something truly extraordinary.
23/1/24, 9:09 AM - +263 77 311 2014: Great then. No problem I will be waiting for the update

*The AFRICA MEET AND GREET is HAPPENING this month,* and it's going to be massive – the biggest in Zimbabwe's history, with an expected crowd of 5000 people! Surprising, isn't it? Get ready for an unforgettable experience! 🌍🎉
This time it is bigger and better! Our Founder & CEO, Mr. Angad along with our team, admission officers, and counselors whom all of you have met behind the screens— are up to share priceless insights that will shape your next four years in India.
So, get ready for this epic adventure, and I'll share the details with you super soon! ⚡

I recommend bringing your parents and guardians to the event. They play a crucial role in your education decisions. This event offers them a chance to understand the program and witness the journeys of past students, providing valuable insights for your higher education journey in India.🇮🇳
1/2/24, 7:07 PM - +263 77 311 2014: Good evening Ms Aditi. I hope you are doing well.

I hope you're aware that here in Zimbabwe it's summer season and we are receiving heavy rains so sometimes network for going online might be poor I apologize for that.
1/2/24, 7:11 PM - +263 77 311 2014: That's very great to know that we are invited. Surely for me to provide you with information on how many of us are coming there I would like you to give me a clue on which week exactly are you expecting for this occasion so that I will tell my father to arrange his programs in oder which suits to be on that occasion. As you know my father is a Headmaster he will need to attend some meetings which are important which is hard for him not to attend.

But I am sure my mother and I will be there because it's not a big deal for my mother to attend it. <This message was edited>

Well we reconsider this event with my parents and we have noticed that it costs us a lot you know I am from Masvingo Gutu and that's far from Harare. You know the expenses are too much for my parents to carry on top of those they already have. Their pay was reduced of which they are busy stocking money for this big journey so we decided to take it down as a family so that we avoid borrowing money when I depart.
14/2/24, 8:27 AM - +263 77 311 2014: We have reconsider this with my family after taking a look at the benefits if I am lucky and I have registered on the form.

21/2/24, 11:24 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning Nigel!
Hope you are well.

I am looking forward to your response.
21/2/24, 12:53 PM - +263 77 311 2014: Well 19 February was an incredible day. We were at Martin Luther King Jnr Family of Schools, Warren Park 1 Harare having our Meet and Greet as proud Edoofians.

I am glad we meet your representatives and the one who is the founder, he shared us a lot that we needed to know.

Actually my mother used to stress herself because she wasn't really trusting this but this event boost her trust to 100%. The fact that she saw your team with her own eyes and talk to them and also saw a bunch of students who are also in this, well that's enough for her to maximize her trust. *Under Edoofa you're home away from home* that's great to hear some other students who are already in India saying that and seeing their smile on their faces that was wonderful.

Well I mingled with other students getting to know each other as a family. All this is so grateful. Many questions that I were asking myself were answered that day and I'm grateful.

How ever know that Edoofa family is so big next time when you plan for this look for a bigger hall so that no one will miss this one out.

I meet my old friends there I am sharing the pictures below and a video which made me believe all this process after seeing my friend talking.

And on this employable issue there was proof and parents believed that sure you're a great program. There is this person who is now working here in Zimbabwe being the proof for that. I am willing to have more similar events in the future.

It's heartening to know that the event provided an opportunity for your mother to interact with our team and fellow students, ultimately boosting her confidence in the program. Creating a sense of belonging and home away from home is incredibly important to us, and I'm glad to hear that others have expressed similar sentiments.

Mingling with other students and gaining valuable insights into the program must have been a rewarding experience for you. I'm thrilled that many of your questions were answered, and that you found the event to be so beneficial.

Thank you for your feedback regarding the venue size. We'll definitely keep that in mind for future events to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to participate.

I appreciate you sharing your pictures and video with me, and I'm glad to hear that they further solidified your belief in the Edoofa program. It's fantastic to hear about the tangible proof of employability and the positive impact our program has had on individuals.
