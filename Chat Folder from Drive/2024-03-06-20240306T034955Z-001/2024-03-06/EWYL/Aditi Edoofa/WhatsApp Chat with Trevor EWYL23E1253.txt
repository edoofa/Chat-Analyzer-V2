17/2/24, 9:33 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning, Trevor!

While we were having multiple conversations with our students in the past few days for the meet & greet event, we figured that there is a slight confusion in the invitation dates. Hence, I wanted to quickly reach out and ensure that the same is not the case with you.

- As per the invitation, *you* are supposed to attend the event along with your parents on *19th of February* which is Monday.
 
- If you are recommending any of *your friends (Non Edoofians)* along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for *18th of February (8am/1pm) or 19th February(1pm)*. They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event.
17/2/24, 9:33 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Please ensure that you are present at the venue 30 minutes earlier and are dressed appropriately.
Don't forget to carry your admit card!

Cannot wait to see you there tomorrow! Hope you're excited too! 😃🕺🏻
17/2/24, 10:36 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Just a Correction, we will see you there on Monday, *19th February 2024*.
18/2/24, 10:33 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning Trevor!

We are ready to make your weekend extra special and worthwhile!  We do realize we've been reaching out to you a bit more frequently than usual 😃, but the wait is finally over, and we're bursting with excitement to meet you at the meet & greet event tomorrow!🕺🏻

While we make the necessary arrangements for you and your parents at the venue, could you please let us know who along with you is attending the event?
18/2/24, 10:33 AM - Aditi Edoofa: In the meanwhile, I am sharing a few pictures & clips of yesterday's seminar with you. Take a look!

The past three days flew by in a whirlwind for Team Edoofa – both for those in India and those in Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. Now that we've had a chance to catch our breath, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success.

Your insights from the event are highly valued, and I'm keen to hear about your experience. Would you be open to sharing your thoughts, including your interest in attending similar events in the future and any suggestions for improvement? Additionally, if you have captured any memorable moments in photos, we would greatly appreciate you sharing them.

26/2/24, 8:56 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
26/2/24, 8:56 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So Trevor, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
26/2/24, 9:01 AM - +263 77 763 6776: Thank you for the opportunity 

I plan to be a chartered accountant and auditor and begin a consultancy practice. 

EWYL program gets me started on developing some people skills that will be essential
26/2/24, 9:03 AM - Aditi Edoofa: You're very welcome! It's great to hear about your ambition to become a chartered accountant, auditor, and eventually start your own consultancy practice. Developing people skills is indeed essential for success in these fields, and the EWYL program sounds like an excellent opportunity to begin honing those skills while also pursuing your academic and professional goals. Wishing you all the best as you embark on this exciting journey toward your future career!
26/2/24, 9:03 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
26/2/24, 9:05 AM - +263 77 763 6776: Not yet
26/2/24, 9:09 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
26/2/24, 9:09 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
26/2/24, 9:17 AM - +263 77 763 6776: Noted
26/2/24, 9:17 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
26/2/24, 9:18 AM - +263 77 763 6776: Noted
26/2/24, 9:19 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
26/2/24, 9:24 AM - +263 77 763 6776: Yes
26/2/24, 9:25 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

How does that sound?

28/2/24, 2:26 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.

My mentor wants to make sure I have a great academic journey, that I have enough opportunities to self finance my education in India & that I’m equipped with relevant 21st century skills to prepare me for the real life workplace atmosphere ahead.

1/3/24, 2:57 PM - +263 77 763 6776: It was talking about how in today's COVID era thet there are only two ways one can do to not lose their job which is the awareness of how the job in the future will look like and acquiring skills needed to perform said job in the future. There is awareness- being updated about current things /events happening in the present, acquiring skills needed to reach our career goals and to have knowledge on the skills emerging in the present eg online digital skills and literacy, social media literacy, creative content writing and so on. And to also be aware of enduring skills like networking, decision making, empathy and so on
1/3/24, 2:59 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Fantastic, today's session concludes here. 
Please note that there are no sessions scheduled for Saturday and Sunday.

Hope you are well.

Are you ready for the session?🚀
5/3/24, 1:43 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Yes I am ready
5/3/24, 1:55 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
5/3/24, 1:55 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Additionally, I want to inform you that at present, the first project is on hold owing to the substantial number of projects and commitments we are currently managing. We are prioritizing our efforts to ensure the successful completion of existing tasks before resuming work on this project. Till that time you may focus on the projects that I am going to explain.
5/3/24, 1:55 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *I think we’re ready to move to the community building project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share an audio file from our mentorship team and you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it!
5/3/24, 1:55 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/3/24, 2:03 PM - +263 77 763 6776: I have managed to listen
5/3/24, 2:10 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
5/3/24, 2:13 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Community building involved making connections with others and strengthening those connections. It relates to the EWYL program by looking for other students and letting them know about Edoofa while getting credits in the process that will reduce the financial burden that I have left
5/3/24, 2:23 PM - Aditi Edoofa: That’s awesome, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.

5/3/24, 2:49 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
5/3/24, 2:49 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*TREVOR/ADITI*
5/3/24, 2:50 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
5/3/24, 2:50 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
5/3/24, 2:50 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *ADD MENTOR:*

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

5/3/24, 3:00 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The current session has come to an end. Let's reconvene tomorrow at the same time for our next session. Please ensure that you're punctual. ⌛
