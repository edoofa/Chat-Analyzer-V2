In light of this, I have decided to reschedule our sessions to Monday through Friday from 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM. This schedule change will ensure more productive sessions, and I look forward to seeing you today at the new time!

Yes I am ma'am
29/2/24, 1:41 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
29/2/24, 1:41 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
29/2/24, 1:43 PM - +263 77 485 5312: Ok let me arlert them so that you can talk to them, they're my parents.
29/2/24, 1:47 PM - +263 77 485 5312: Seems they are all unavailable, l tried to call Dad his phone is not available ma'am.
29/2/24, 2:00 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I understand. It's wonderful to have them. I extend a warm welcome to them for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey
29/2/24, 2:00 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So Margret, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
29/2/24, 2:05 PM - +263 77 485 5312: My long term goals is to archive a degree in law and then move on to learn more up until l become a judge. This program will help me through getting experience and through my expenses
29/2/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: It's admirable to hear about your long-term goals of pursuing a degree in law and eventually becoming a judge. The determination and dedication you have towards achieving these aspirations are commendable. The EWYL will undoubtedly provide valuable experience and support towards reaching these goals, both in terms of gaining practical experience and helping with expenses along the way. Keep focused on your dreams, and with hard work and perseverance, you can surely achieve them.
29/2/24, 2:16 PM - +263 77 485 5312: I promise I will ma'am.
29/2/24, 2:18 PM - +263 77 430 4040: Hello ma'am, l'm Margaret's mother. I am happy to be with you,
29/2/24, 2:29 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am also glad that you are actively participating in her EWYL journey. <This message was edited>
29/2/24, 2:29 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
29/2/24, 2:31 PM - +263 77 485 5312: No ma'am may you please shed light on the two.
29/2/24, 2:48 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
29/2/24, 2:48 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
29/2/24, 2:58 PM - +263 77 349 9806: I am Margret father.l am fyn and how are you.
29/2/24, 3:10 PM - Aditi Edoofa: It's wonderful to connect with you. I extend a warm welcome to you for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey

1/3/24, 1:38 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Happy New Month🌸!

So are you ready for today's session?🚀
1/3/24, 1:39 PM - +263 77 485 5312: Happy new month to you too ma'am.
I am doing well ma'am and you.
Yes ma'am I am ready.
1/3/24, 1:44 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am well. Thanks for asking.
1/3/24, 1:44 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts. <This message was edited>
1/3/24, 1:46 PM - +263 77 485 5312: I am glad to have them here
1/3/24, 2:01 PM - +263 77 349 9806: Good afternoon madam.
1/3/24, 2:40 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great, please excuse me for the delay in reply as I was facing some network challenges.
1/3/24, 2:40 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
1/3/24, 2:42 PM - +263 77 485 5312: Yes ma'am.
1/3/24, 2:52 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

5/3/24, 2:01 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am sure you will be featured one day!
5/3/24, 2:01 PM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
5/3/24, 2:04 PM - +263 77 485 5312: It sounds very interesting.
5/3/24, 2:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
5/3/24, 2:13 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/3/24, 2:13 PM - +263 77 485 5312: Yes ma'am.
5/3/24, 2:23 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, that’s wonderful. I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything!
5/3/24, 2:25 PM - +263 77 485 5312: Ok I will do that as soon as I am done reading it ma'am
5/3/24, 2:25 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!
5/3/24, 2:59 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The current session has come to an end. Let's reconvene tomorrow at the same time for our next session. Please ensure that you're punctual. ⌛
