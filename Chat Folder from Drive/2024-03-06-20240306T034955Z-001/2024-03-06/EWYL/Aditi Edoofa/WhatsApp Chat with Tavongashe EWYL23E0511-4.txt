I trust you had a wonderful Christmas! Follow the Proud Edoofian ritual on the EWYL Line to commence your session – I'm eager to see your Christmas pictures and hear your festive stories. 🎄✨
26/12/23, 12:29 PM - +263 78 911 4587: Thank you for the concern. Well my family had a wonderful day but I personally don't believe in christmas
26/12/23, 12:35 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Why so?
26/12/23, 12:37 PM - +263 78 911 4587: According to my understanding of the Bible Jesus wasn't born on Christmas
26/12/23, 12:55 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Absolutely, and it's a great point to clarify. The Bible doesn't provide a specific date for the birth of Jesus. December 25th was chosen by later Christians to celebrate His birth, but it's not mentioned in the biblical accounts. The choice of December 25th was influenced by the Roman festival of Saturnalia and the winter solstice. Some scholars believe that Jesus was more likely born in the spring or fall.

So, when people celebrate Christmas on December 25th, it's more about commemorating the birth of Jesus and spreading the message of love, peace, and goodwill rather than pinpointing the exact historical date. Different cultures and Christian denominations may have varying traditions and interpretations related to the celebration.
26/12/23, 12:59 PM - +263 78 911 4587: I do understand that but the Bible clarify on the time angel Gabriel visited Mary with the message of her carrying the baby

6/1/24, 1:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Tavongashe

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of *our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs*, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
11/1/24, 4:22 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hellooooo!!!!

I quickly just wanted to share the scoop on *Slice Con'24—it was seriously awesome!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️

Most of my students have already quite enthusiastically reserved seats for themselves and their family and friends.

Is everything alright? Are you facing any challenges? Is there something you'd like to share?
