While we were having multiple conversations with our students in the past few days for the meet & greet event, we figured that there is a slight confusion in the invitation dates. Hence, I wanted to quickly reach out and ensure that the same is not the case with yo*.

- As per the invitation, you are supposed to attend the event along with your parents on 19th of February which is Mond*y.
 
- If you are recommending any of your friends (Non Edoofians) along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for 18th of February (8am/1pm) or 19th February(1pm). They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event.
17/2/24, 10:33 AM - Rithvik Edoofa: Please ensure that you are present at the venue 30 minutes earlier and are dressed appropriately.
Don't forget to carry your admit card!

5/3/24, 2:41 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Perfect! Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Let me tell you what our main objectives are:

The *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfil all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.

The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.

Did you understand the goals, Michael?
5/3/24, 2:43 PM - +263 78 871 1608: Yes I understood the goals and am sure l am going to get those credits as many as they can be
5/3/24, 3:06 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Great, now, apart from these, I have also set three goals for myself for your EWYL journey:

1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!

How does that sound, Michael?
