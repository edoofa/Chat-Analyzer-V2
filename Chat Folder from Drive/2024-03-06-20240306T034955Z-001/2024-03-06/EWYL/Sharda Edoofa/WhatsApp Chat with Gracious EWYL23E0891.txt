I trust this message finds you well. With regards to our discussion in the day, I wanted to reach out to you and thank you for prioritizing and expediting the EWYL journey for Gracious. We have already set up the dedicated group for Gracious and are excited about the upcoming opportunities.

Having recently shared a glimpse of our annual Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare, we are eager to ensure that Gracious is well-informed and ready to make the most of this transformative experience. Hence, please provide them with all the necessary details regarding the event tomorrow and guide them on how Gracious can commence their EWYL journey seamlessly from this point onward. <This message was edited>

Warm greetings from India! While we would like to believe you might be dreaming of visiting us soon, we couldn't wait any longer to meet you! That's why we're thrilled to announce the special, annual and exclusive Africa Meet & Greet 2024, where our Founder Mr Angad Singh along with Senior Counsellors, Admission Officers, EWYL Mentors and other members of Team Edoofa is flying all the way from India to Zimbabwe just to meet you! ✈😄

This exciting one-day event will be packed with valuable insights. You'll gain practical knowledge through seminars and sessions by industry experts, and be inspired by real-life experiences from your seniors who are already thriving in India thanks to Edoofa. Picture this: An amazing day filled with knowledge, connection, and the chance to meet the Edoofa team face-to-face! We would be delighted to welcome you and your family to this exclusive event. This is a great oppurtunity for you to educate yourself about the employment oppurtunities after graduation in the ever growing global market. You would also be able to get a sneak peak into the life on an Edoofian through the lens of your seniors🌍."
