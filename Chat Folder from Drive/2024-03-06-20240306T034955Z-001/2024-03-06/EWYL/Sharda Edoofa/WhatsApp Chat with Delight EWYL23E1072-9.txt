15/1/24, 8:33 AM - +263 77 302 5297: Good morning
15/1/24, 8:34 AM - +263 78 395 8654: Morning, we are fine
15/1/24, 8:35 AM - Sharda Edoofa: I am glad to know that.
15/1/24, 8:38 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
15/1/24, 8:45 AM - +263 78 395 8654: Am not quite sure
15/1/24, 8:52 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *Delight* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.

The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
15/1/24, 8:59 AM - +263 78 395 8654: Understood
15/1/24, 9:13 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*.

18/1/24, 9:25 AM - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 9:25 AM - Sharda Edoofa: I want you to take today’s time, to go through the document, read about each, and every project in detail, and then answer some of my questions
1. Name all three projects.
2. What do you understand from Project 1?
3. What do you understand from Project 2?
4. What do you understand from Project 3?
18/1/24, 9:26 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Wrapping up the session I must say it's been a wonderful interaction. I can't wait for our next one.🥳
18/1/24, 9:26 AM - +263 78 395 8654: Yes it's clear
18/1/24, 2:25 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Great!
19/1/24, 6:13 AM - +263 78 395 8654: 1. The three projects are;  Corporate Alliances
Community building,
African Schools Education Reform Mission.
2.What do you understand from project 1.
Project 1 is Corporate Alliances whereby a student is assigned to learn practically to interact with companies/ stakeholders in his/ her country  and connect them to the manager of Edoofa, by involving video call, and signing of contracts using online information. The student must identify a company which is within Africa or his/her continent then follow the activities online using LinkedIn account to connect and collect the needed information until they reach an agreement of contract signing which link the stakeholders and the Edoofa manager. By completing this process, the student earn Scholarship credits.
2: My understanding from project 2 which is Community building is that the project is about advertising the goodness of Edoofa Educational ecosystem to young age groups who have just graduated from senior Secondary school recently within 6 months or who are yet to finish their senior Secondary school education to be part of the Edoofa program, so that they can fulfil their dreams and understand the developing of an organization which is based on growing by creating social impact. When you complete this stage that's when certain amounts of Scholarship credits are offered. 
3: Project 3 which is African Schools Education Reform Mission is when a student is directed to reach local senior Secondary schools and facilitate decision makers to connect with Edoofa.
The main aim of Edoofa being connected to the decision makers is to transform and share world class technology and improve African Education.
They will share career counseling, courses and Scholarship opportunities . When identifying Schools, your School must be the first listed. The student will be identified through LinkedIn account. Also after completing this you can earn Scholarship credits.

19/1/24, 9:55 AM - +263 78 395 8654: The guide for searching companies - this document helps me to look for potential companies who are willing to collaborate with Edoofa. The company must be willing to extend all students development that have been enrolled in Edoofa program. When choosing the right type of companies, the following factors must be considered: 
1. The nature of the company if it is student friendly.
2. Scale of the company which must not be too big or too small.
3. The Financial stability where the selected company must be financially stable and can be observed through a LinkedIn account.
4. Background of the founder he/she must be highly qualified. To notice all this there are steps that can be followed through Google, LinkedIn, Inc4media and many more. The six steps provided must be followed for easy identification of the required information.

2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not

23/1/24, 9:54 AM - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
23/1/24, 9:54 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

27/1/24, 8:34 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *Greetings of the day, Delight*
I hope this message finds you in good spirits. I want to share some heartfelt news with you. After careful consideration, I've come to a decision that carries a mix of emotions. *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor.*

As we journey through this moment, I can't help but feel a mix of emotions realizing that our daily interactions are about to change. *Saying goodbye to our current way of connecting brings a bittersweet feeling*, but deep down, I see change as a chance for growth and the discovery of new opportunities.

Reflecting on our shared journey, I am truly humbled by the extraordinary moments we've experienced together—the bonds we've forged, the shared laughter, and the countless instances of mutual growth and learning.
27/1/24, 8:35 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

Thank you for being an integral part of my life's journey. Keep radiating brilliance, dare to dream ambitiously, and always remember the remarkable potential within you. 
*I want to assure you that the mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
27/1/24, 9:00 AM - +263 78 395 8654: That's really painful to part but at the same time I wish you the best in whatever decision you take. Thank you so much for the update and all the  journey we have together, you are such a kind and  humble mentor who wishes great things to others. Am very grateful wishing the best ever.

21/2/24, 1:02 PM - +263 78 395 8654: I was really happy to be part of this seminar. I gained a lot of experience from the ones who have already gone to study abroad. The Edoofa seminar was very informative and inspiring. It was my pleasure to connect with like- minded people and l learn from experts in a variety of fields. It's really great that the Edoofa team makes effort to empower the youth. I was well furnished with information and was more enlightened on the Scholarship program and how students who are already there are managing to stay under the the hands of team Edoofa.
My suggestions for improvement are: 
The team must also give provisions for students who are not yet into the program to attend the seminar so that they will be well informed that's it's not a scam since most are loosing this opportunity because of the fear of unknown.
