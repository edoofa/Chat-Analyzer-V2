I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:34 PM - Sharda Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
6/1/24, 2:29 PM - +263 77 356 2704: Thank you for the update
11/1/24, 4:13 PM - Sharda Edoofa: _Greetings of the day, Roy_!
You are very welcome please.

Edoofa organized a grand flagship event from Monday to Wednesday named *SLICE Con'24 (Symposium of Leaders, Inventors, and Creators with Edoofa*)🫱🏻‍🫲🏼 where our Indian Edoofians, representing partner universities,  immersed in a grand event _featuring CEOs and Marketing heads of multi-millionaire brands_📈, braced themselves for networking opportunities, internships, and more. The event was really grand, let me show you few glimpses of this event.

I cannot wait to start our session!
27/1/24, 8:43 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *Greetings of the day, Roy*
I hope this message finds you in good spirits. I want to share some heartfelt news with you. After careful consideration, I've come to a decision that carries a mix of emotions. *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor.*

As we journey through this moment, I can't help but feel a mix of emotions realizing that our daily interactions are about to change. *Saying goodbye to our current way of connecting brings a bittersweet feeling*, but deep down, I see change as a chance for growth and the discovery of new opportunities.

Reflecting on our shared journey, I am truly humbled by the extraordinary moments we've experienced together—the bonds we've forged, the shared laughter, and the countless instances of mutual growth and learning.
27/1/24, 8:46 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

Thank you for being an integral part of my life's journey. Keep radiating brilliance, dare to dream ambitiously, and always remember the remarkable potential within you. 
*I want to assure you that the mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
27/1/24, 8:51 AM - +263 77 492 3669: Thank you for your kind message and for all the time and effort you've put into mentoring me.I'm truly grateful for the impact you've had on my life and for the wisdom you've shared on our EWYL dedicated line. I am truly gonna miss you mentor because in you I had found a mentor and a friend at the same time, but I respect your need to pursue other goals and interests. I look forward to continuing our friendship and staying in touch. Thank you again for everything, and best of luck on your new journey❤️.
1/2/24, 3:34 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon, Roy!

29/2/24, 7:04 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Good morning Roy!
Please make sure you message on the line today at the same time as that of yesterday for the session scheduled for today.
5/3/24, 1:15 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Good Afternoon Roy,
I hope this message finds you well! I saw that you have still not started with your sessions on the EWYL line. May I know if you are facing any challenges to join in for the sessions?
5/3/24, 2:03 PM - +263 77 492 3669: Good afternoon sir
5/3/24, 2:15 PM - +263 77 492 3669: I am facing challenges to join the EWYL sessions because I have a commitment. I have recently started working in order to help my parents raise funds for my journey to study in India . So during the day I won't be able to attend the sessions but I don't know sir if it's possible you can try to squeeze me on your schedule Saturdays around 1700hrs I would have come back home from work and on Sundays I will also be available anytime . During weekdays it might be a challenge to attend the sessions because we knock off around 1800 hours and I don't know if you will still be available on the dedicated line around that time of the day.
