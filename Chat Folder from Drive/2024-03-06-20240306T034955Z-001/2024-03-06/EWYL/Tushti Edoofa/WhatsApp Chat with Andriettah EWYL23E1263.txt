22/2/24, 1:34 PM - +263 71 614 6798: Good afternoon
22/2/24, 1:38 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Andriettah
22/2/24, 1:38 PM - Tushti Edoofa: How are you doing today?
22/2/24, 1:38 PM - +263 71 614 6798: Am fine thank you how are you
22/2/24, 1:41 PM - Tushti Edoofa: I am doing great, thanks!
22/2/24, 1:43 PM - Tushti Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
22/2/24, 1:43 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Now, before we begin, I would like for you to give a brief introduction of yourself.
22/2/24, 1:45 PM - +263 71 614 6798: My name is Andriettah Zeleza and l am 22years old .My highest educational level is A level commercials combination consisting of Accounting, Economics and Business Studies. I would love to study Bachelor of Commerce.
22/2/24, 1:47 PM - Tushti Edoofa: That's good to know, Andriettah. Do tell me a little more about your family. Do you have any siblings? If yes, what do they do?
22/2/24, 1:48 PM - +263 71 614 6798: I am the only child ma’am
22/2/24, 1:49 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Oh, what a conincidence! I, too, happen to be a single child.
22/2/24, 1:50 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
22/2/24, 1:50 PM - +263 71 614 6798: That’s great!
22/2/24, 1:51 PM - +263 71 614 6798: Am not sure if l follow ma’am
22/2/24, 1:51 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
22/2/24, 1:52 PM - Tushti Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
22/2/24, 1:52 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Are you able to understand now?
22/2/24, 1:53 PM - +263 71 614 6798: Yes ma’am thank you
22/2/24, 1:53 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the EWYL team. 
Ms. Sanjana is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have Ms. Davi, Head coach is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
22/2/24, 1:53 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program, we will be connected even when you are here in India.
22/2/24, 1:54 PM - +263 71 614 6798: Noted ma’am
22/2/24, 1:54 PM - Tushti Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 2 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
22/2/24, 1:54 PM - Tushti Edoofa: *Sounds interesting, right?*
22/2/24, 1:56 PM - +263 71 614 6798: Yes it does
22/2/24, 1:57 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough. <This message was edited>
22/2/24, 1:58 PM - Tushti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/2/24, 1:58 PM - +263 71 614 6798: Noted ma’am
22/2/24, 1:59 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Once you have gone through it, do let me know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
22/2/24, 1:59 PM - +263 71 614 6798: Okay ma’am
22/2/24, 2:08 PM - +263 71 614 6798: What caught my attention was the first quote “1.I hated every minute of training, but I said, 'Don't quit. Suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion.' 

That itself is motivation , l believe no matter how hard it gets quitting  is not a solution  because the only way to fail is when we stop trying
22/2/24, 2:09 PM - Tushti Edoofa: That's great
22/2/24, 2:09 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
22/2/24, 2:10 PM - +263 71 614 6798: Yes l did that was amazing 
Its sure a good experience <This message was edited>
22/2/24, 2:10 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Great
22/2/24, 2:10 PM - Tushti Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Andriettah?
22/2/24, 2:12 PM - +263 71 614 6798: Sounds great!
22/2/24, 2:14 PM - Tushti Edoofa: I enjoyed our conversation, I am certain, you would have a better understanding of what your EWYL journey is going to look like, full of knowledge and opportunities to grow and develop yourself. I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from so far discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.

*Are you ready for the questions?*

27/2/24, 2:04 PM - Tushti Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
27/2/24, 2:05 PM - +263 71 614 6798: Noted ma’am
27/2/24, 2:06 PM - Tushti Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
27/2/24, 2:06 PM - +263 71 614 6798: Okay ma’am
27/2/24, 2:08 PM - Tushti Edoofa: A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*ANDRIETTAH/JULIA*
27/2/24, 2:08 PM - Tushti Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
27/2/24, 2:09 PM - Tushti Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
27/2/24, 2:09 PM - Tushti Edoofa: *ADD MENTOR:*

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

27/2/24, 2:14 PM - Tushti Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
27/2/24, 2:15 PM - Tushti Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

28/2/24, 2:33 PM - Tushti Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to form a WhatsApp where they can add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

Greetings to you @27617632582 ! Today, as you already know there won't be any sessions scheduled for Andriettah. Instead, we'd like to take this opportunity to connect with you. 
I am sure that you must have had a chance to go through the conversations that I had with Andriettah until now and that must have given you a certain clarity towards the program.
