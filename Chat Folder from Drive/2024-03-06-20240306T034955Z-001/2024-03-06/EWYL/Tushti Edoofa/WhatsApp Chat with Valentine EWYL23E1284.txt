28/2/24, 1:50 PM - Tushti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/2/24, 1:52 PM - +263 71 573 7527: I've finished watching the video !
28/2/24, 1:57 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
28/2/24, 1:59 PM - +263 71 573 7527: Yes I understand
28/2/24, 2:02 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
28/2/24, 2:02 PM - Tushti Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
28/2/24, 2:03 PM - +263 71 573 7527: Wow that's amazing !
28/2/24, 2:05 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
28/2/24, 2:06 PM - +263 71 573 7527: It's a pleasure to meet them all I am very excited for the journey itself
28/2/24, 2:23 PM - Tushti Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
28/2/24, 2:24 PM - +263 71 573 7527: Yes very interesting
28/2/24, 2:26 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.
28/2/24, 2:27 PM - Tushti Edoofa: <Media omitted>

28/2/24, 2:35 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Great to hear from you Valentine.
28/2/24, 2:35 PM - Tushti Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
28/2/24, 2:36 PM - +263 71 573 7527: Like you said every section has something that stands out but I genuinely love the Qoutes that are part of the newsletters!
28/2/24, 2:38 PM - Tushti Edoofa: I also loved the quotes. Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
28/2/24, 2:39 PM - +263 71 573 7527: Yes I did notice that section and it would be such an honour to be featured and mentioned by the founder !

28/2/24, 2:46 PM - Tushti Edoofa: I enjoyed our conversation, I am certain, you would have a better understanding of what your EWYL journey is going to look like, full of knowledge and opportunities to grow and develop yourself. Before we end our discussion for the day,I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from today’s discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.*Are you ready for the questions?*

29/2/24, 1:36 PM - Tushti Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
29/2/24, 1:36 PM - Tushti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/2/24, 1:36 PM - +263 71 573 7527: Yes that's clear
29/2/24, 1:43 PM - +263 71 573 7527: I've finished going through the document
29/2/24, 1:45 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Okay, that’s wonderful. I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
29/2/24, 1:47 PM - +263 71 573 7527: Ok so basically what I understood from the document was that it was basically an outline of the projects one executes during the EWYL program and the amount of money generated from the Scholarship credits by each program
29/2/24, 1:49 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Great Job.  I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
29/2/24, 1:49 PM - +263 71 573 7527: Ok !
29/2/24, 1:49 PM - Tushti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/2/24, 1:52 PM - +263 71 573 7527: I have finished the audio Ms Julia
29/2/24, 1:53 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
29/2/24, 1:54 PM - +263 71 573 7527: Ok so basically what I heard from the audio is the project Corporate Alliance which you connect with companies telling them what Edoofa does and how it is helping me
29/2/24, 1:56 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Amazing, I’m happy with your understanding.
29/2/24, 1:56 PM - Tushti Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
29/2/24, 1:57 PM - +263 71 573 7527: Ok great !
29/2/24, 1:57 PM - Tushti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/2/24, 2:01 PM - +263 71 573 7527: I have finished going through the document and what I have understood is companies that are needed can either be student centred or tech based and you can research these companies on social places such as Linked and you need to do a through background check on the founder of the company as well
29/2/24, 2:02 PM - Tushti Edoofa: You know what, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
29/2/24, 2:03 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –

29/2/24, 2:11 PM - +263 71 573 7527: Oh so I am not starting the project immediately ?
29/2/24, 2:13 PM - Tushti Edoofa: For this project you will not be working now but there are other projects which we will discuss now, and for that you can work simultaneously.
29/2/24, 2:14 PM - +263 71 573 7527: Oh OK that's great
29/2/24, 2:16 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Fantastic to hear that.
29/2/24, 2:16 PM - Tushti Edoofa: *Now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it!
29/2/24, 2:16 PM - +263 71 573 7527: Ok great
29/2/24, 2:16 PM - Tushti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/2/24, 2:21 PM - +263 71 573 7527: I have finished the audio
29/2/24, 2:22 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
29/2/24, 2:23 PM - +263 71 573 7527: Ok so what have managed to grasp from the audio is that this project deals largely with creating a community for other African students to join Edoofa and have equal learning opportunities
29/2/24, 2:24 PM - Tushti Edoofa: That’s awesome, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.
29/2/24, 2:25 PM - Tushti Edoofa: 1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

29/2/24, 2:32 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Yes you are absolutely right.

29/2/24, 2:36 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Fantastic to hear that.
29/2/24, 2:36 PM - Tushti Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
29/2/24, 2:37 PM - +263 71 573 7527: Ok
29/2/24, 2:38 PM - Tushti Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
29/2/24, 2:39 PM - Tushti Edoofa: *STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*VALENTINE/JULIA*
29/2/24, 2:39 PM - Tushti Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
29/2/24, 2:39 PM - Tushti Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
29/2/24, 2:40 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

29/2/24, 2:41 PM - Tushti Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
29/2/24, 2:41 PM - Tushti Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

So in such a case, we insist that students to form a WhatsApp where they can add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
