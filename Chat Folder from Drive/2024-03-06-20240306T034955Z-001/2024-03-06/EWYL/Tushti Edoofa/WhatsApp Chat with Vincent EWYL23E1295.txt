28/2/24, 8:38 AM - +263 77 244 1199: I'm Vincent's Father 

I don't know if we are to be part of this session or only for Vincent
28/2/24, 8:49 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Hello dear Parent
This session is scheduled both for students and the parents so that parents also get clarification regarding the EWYL program.
If you are busy with your work you can share your thoughts after the end of the session on how you feel about the EWYL.
28/2/24, 8:52 AM - +263 77 170 0223: May l ask if me not seeing  this video will disrupt the lessons
28/2/24, 8:54 AM - Tushti Edoofa: It is just an introduction video of mine. You can later go through the video when the network is stable.
28/2/24, 8:55 AM - +263 77 170 0223: Understood will do so
28/2/24, 8:55 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
28/2/24, 8:59 AM - +263 77 170 0223: I assume that it is to promote high end education  at an affordable  cost and to allow the students to know the basics of what is required from them and the impacts of their actions
28/2/24, 9:00 AM - +263 77 170 0223: I'm not certain  about my answer please enlighten me if lm wrong
28/2/24, 9:00 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.

The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
28/2/24, 9:03 AM - +263 77 170 0223: Understood
28/2/24, 9:04 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
28/2/24, 9:06 AM - +263 77 170 0223: Thank you and it is nice to meet you Ms Davi and Ms Sanjana
28/2/24, 9:07 AM - +263 77 170 0223: I'm sure it will be a pleasure  learning from you
28/2/24, 9:09 AM - Tushti Edoofa: They are also honored to have you, sure you will hear from them in the future.
28/2/24, 9:09 AM - +263 77 170 0223: Noted
28/2/24, 9:10 AM - Tushti Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
28/2/24, 9:12 AM - +263 77 170 0223: Yes it does
28/2/24, 9:14 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Great to hear!
28/2/24, 9:15 AM - +263 77 170 0223: Yes
28/2/24, 9:15 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

28/2/24, 9:29 AM - +263 77 170 0223: From what l understood  the newsletters give a highlight on the things we should be aware of and what we should  desist  from doing with qoutes that will motivate us . It also gives opportunities to students to share their stories which  will inspire us to move onwards  and be aware of what to expect <This message was edited>
28/2/24, 9:31 AM - +263 77 170 0223: I myself have already developed a fondness to  them
28/2/24, 9:33 AM - Tushti Edoofa: That's wonderful to hear! Your positive connection with them will undoubtedly contribute to a supportive and enriching environment.
28/2/24, 9:33 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
28/2/24, 9:33 AM - +263 77 170 0223: I thing it's acts as a guide for instance one if them was mentioning the impacts of our behavior which determine  the environment  we end up in were we can do somethings to stay out of bad environment  and helps to abandon behavior traits that may cost us
28/2/24, 9:34 AM - +263 77 170 0223: Yes l noticied it and it will be an honor
28/2/24, 9:36 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Absolutely! Recognizing the impact of our behavior on our environment is a crucial insight.

28/2/24, 9:36 AM - +263 77 170 0223: Yes it's very much helpful
28/2/24, 9:37 AM - +263 77 170 0223: Indeed
28/2/24, 9:39 AM - Tushti Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?

28/2/24, 9:43 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Fantastic to hear! Embracing the journey with enthusiasm is key, and I'm confident it will be an eventful and rewarding experience for you. 😊
28/2/24, 9:43 AM - Tushti Edoofa: I enjoyed our conversation, I am certain, you would have a better understanding of what your EWYL journey is going to look like, full of knowledge and opportunities to grow and develop yourself. Before we end our discussion for the day,I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from today’s discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.*Are you ready for the questions?*
28/2/24, 9:44 AM - +263 77 170 0223: Yes l am
28/2/24, 9:45 AM - Tushti Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube

4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is.
28/2/24, 9:58 AM - +263 77 170 0223: 1. My Mentor  Ms Julia who will be taking me through everythingl need to know,with Ms Sanjana as the head of department who will provide guidance and Ms Davi as the head coach who will be mentoring me us through  the curriculum 
2. To ensure l am given enough opportunity to self finance myself ,to ensure that my academic journey is great and to be able to attain the skills required from me as a 21st century students  to be able to adapt to the real world workplace .
3. Mr Angad Singh interact with his students through  the use of the Newsletter 
4. The hall of inspiration is a form of communication which the founder uses to interact with students and acknowledge  great performance and allows student to share their  story which will not only motivate them to strive even more but the other students as well as they aspire to have their own names imprinted on the pages of the newsletters. It also acts as  a guide that will show us how to view the world and learn from the experiences  of others as we try to avoid  the same mistakes and better our lives
28/2/24, 10:01 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Fantastic to hear from you Vincent. You really had a great understanding. Keep going like this.

29/2/24, 9:42 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Perfect.  We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
29/2/24, 9:42 AM - Tushti Edoofa: <Media omitted>

29/2/24, 10:19 AM - +263 77 170 0223: From my understanding the first requires me to connect with companies that are scholar and technology based and share my message  about edoofa and ig will be done in five stages which require mg involvement first l have to find them ,second  l have to identify the decision  makers third l have to share  edoofas message, and arrange  a meeting as well as giving the feedback of the project,this requires a specific skillset and mindset it has its miles stones . Which l will be rewarded. As For the second it requires me to enlarge the edoofas sphere of intake were l have to involve fellow secondary graduates and tell them about the edoofa scholarship and provide them with the necessary knowledge also having it's milestone as rewards are given based on the level the applicants advance in their pursuit of edoofa. Lastly the final project will require me to draft down a list of schools that will be taken into consideration by edoofa on that list my school should be there to enlarge the influence  of edoofa through  it's pursuit to assist  African schools and groom potential edoofains
29/2/24, 10:20 AM - +263 77 170 0223: This is my take on the document
29/2/24, 10:37 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Great Job. You really had a perfect understanding.

29/2/24, 10:39 AM - Tushti Edoofa: <Media omitted>

1/3/24, 9:50 AM - +263 77 170 0223: Question After they fill in this offline application  to whom do l send the application  to
1/3/24, 9:52 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Let me explain to you in detail.
1/3/24, 9:52 AM - +263 77 170 0223: Okay
1/3/24, 9:52 AM - Tushti Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
1/3/24, 9:53 AM - Tushti Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
1/3/24, 9:53 AM - Tushti Edoofa: *STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*VINCENT/JULIA*
1/3/24, 9:53 AM - Tushti Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
1/3/24, 9:54 AM - Tushti Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
1/3/24, 9:54 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

1/3/24, 9:55 AM - Tushti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
1/3/24, 9:55 AM - Tushti Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
1/3/24, 9:55 AM - Tushti Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

1/3/24, 11:08 AM - Tushti Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to form a WhatsApp where they can add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

Greetings to you @263772441199 @263773852419 ! Today, as you already know there won't be any sessions scheduled for Vincent. Instead, we'd like to take this opportunity to connect with you. 
I am sure that you must have had a chance to go through the conversations that I had with Vincent until now and that must have given you a certain clarity towards the program. I wanted to utilize this opportunity to understand from a parent’s perspective, what are your expectations from Vincent through the EWYL program and how you plan to keep a check on his progress regularly.
Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

Yes I'm following and it quite interesting sessions. We can visualise our son achieving greater heights in his career.

It is quite involving and make Vincent more forecasted. Developing skills in engagement with Senior People and any Institutions that can also build his confidence.
Also being groomed to be an ambassador for Edoofa for better and affordable education to his fellow colleagues it's quite noble to me as he can help transforming lives of others by linking them to Edoofa Scholarship opportunities.

His involvement in some projects will make understand better than mere reading of books. 

Thank you great progress there. Keep up the good sessions.

Personally I was very impressed with the sessions and the progress made so far.

This will help us save the resolution time and you can go about connecting with the headmasters of the schools that are yet to be connected with us.
