12/2/24, 8:59 AM - +263 77 302 0949: I am Nathanael Maoneke the son of Innocent and Ruth Maoneke. I completed my O level and A Level studies in 2013 and 2015 respectively and then my Honours Degree in Accounting in 2021. For my strengths i do say i am problem solver, a motivator, a natural leader and have the ability to perform under pressure. For my weakness i can say i work hard most of my time and forget that i have a social life .We are five in our family our parents are both teachers and the second born is working  in the Uk and the last born is still doing her O level studies. I would like to study for a master in Accounting and my parents would be financing for the studies . We stay in Harare province. My hobbies are playing basketball, soccer and dance. My short term goal is completing my masters program and get employed whereas my long term goal is to open an accounting firm and be the bridge of those in need. My passion is having a helping to the less privileged so that we can have equal opportunities
12/2/24, 9:03 AM - Ananya Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear about your academic achievements and aspirations. Your dedication to your studies and your desire to pursue a master's degree in Accounting is commendable. With your strengths as a problem solver, motivator, and natural leader, I'm sure you'll excel in your chosen field.

It's important to strike a balance between work and social life, so being aware of your tendency to prioritize work is a good step. Remember to take time for yourself and enjoy your hobbies, such as playing basketball, soccer, and dance.

Your short-term goal of completing your master's program and finding employment aligns well with your long-term goal of opening an accounting firm and helping those in need. It's inspiring to see your passion for making a difference in the lives of others and promoting equal opportunities.

With the support of your family and your own determination, I have no doubt that you will achieve great success in your future endeavors. Best of luck with your master's studies and your future career in accounting!
12/2/24, 9:10 AM - +263 77 302 0949: thank you
12/2/24, 9:11 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
12/2/24, 9:14 AM - +263 77 302 0949: encouragement on future financial plans and future study options
12/2/24, 9:16 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Lovely! Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
12/2/24, 9:16 AM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
12/2/24, 9:21 AM - +263 77 302 0949: thats great
12/2/24, 9:22 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
12/2/24, 9:27 AM - +263 77 302 0949: it will be nice meeting them
12/2/24, 9:29 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
12/2/24, 9:32 AM - +263 77 302 0949: very interesting
12/2/24, 9:36 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
12/2/24, 9:36 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/2/24, 9:46 AM - +263 77 302 0949: very inspirational
12/2/24, 9:46 AM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
12/2/24, 9:49 AM - +263 77 302 0949: thats exactly what i also feel . it gives a person the zeal to know more
12/2/24, 9:54 AM - Ananya Edoofa: It's been wonderful getting to know you and having you here. I wish we could have connected for a longer time. However, since our session time is over, let's connect tomorrow at the same time. Have a good day!🌟

These remarkable birds travel up to 71,000 kilometers (44,000 miles) round trip every year from their breeding grounds in the Arctic to their wintering grounds in Antarctica and back again.

I completely understand, and I assure you, I was equally excited to meet you as well. Please don't worry, I'll make sure to be the first person you see at the airport.
21/2/24, 10:07 AM - +263 77 302 0949: hope so thank you
22/2/24, 7:38 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Nathanael!

Now that we've successfully wrapped up our three-day event, it's time to resume our regular sessions. Our next session will be today at 8:30 AM. Make sure you're ready to jump back into our learning journey!

Also, don't forget to review what we covered last.🌟
22/2/24, 7:56 AM - +263 77 302 0949: ok thanks with the update
22/2/24, 8:30 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Let us begin our session with an interesting fact: _Africa is home to the world's largest land mammal - the African elephant. These majestic creatures can weigh up to 6 metric tons (approximately 13,000 pounds) and are known for their intelligence, complex social structures, and remarkable memory. Isn't that incredible?_
22/2/24, 8:32 AM - +263 77 302 0949: very incredible
22/2/24, 8:34 AM - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
22/2/24, 8:35 AM - +263 77 302 0949: yes you can
22/2/24, 8:38 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *Using WhatsApp Community Groups for Outreach:*
*Step 1*: Create a WhatsApp group and name it using the format STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY. For example, if you're the mentor, it would be *MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY*.

*Step 2*: Find the right students for your group to ensure effective communication about Edoofa.

*Purpose*: The goal is to reach a broad audience, providing accurate information about Edoofa to prepare them for a smooth counseling session.
22/2/24, 8:38 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Execution:

*Identify Potential Candidates:* - Reach out to students in Form 6 or those who have recently passed Form 6 (A-Level Examination).

*Connect with Form 6 Divisions*: - Assume there are 3 divisions in Form 6, each with around 20 students. Begin with one division. Connect with these students and request to be added to their official or unofficial WhatsApp group.

*Share Your Group Link*: - Once added, share the link to your created WhatsApp group, explaining that it's an opportunity to pursue education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on tuition fees. Encourage them to join for more details.

*Repeat the Process*: - Move on to the next divisions of Form 6, applying the same approach. In this way, you'll reach at least 60 students (3 divisions of Form 6).

*Extend to Form 5*: - Repeat the process in Form 5, targeting another 60 students.
22/2/24, 8:38 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *Result*:

You would have effectively shared information about Edoofa with a minimum of 120 students, creating awareness and interest among potential applicants. This method ensures a wide reach and prepares students for the upcoming counseling sessions.
22/2/24, 8:48 AM - +263 77 302 0949: thats a better method

22/2/24, 8:51 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/2/24, 8:51 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I'm [Your Name], grateful for the Edoofa Scholarship taking me to study in India. With high tuition fees in Zimbabwe, this opportunity is a dream come true.
Back in Zimbabwe, internet costs were steep—around $500 annually. In India, it's just $40 a year, showing how much they value education.
In Zimbabwe, limited seats and job struggles after graduation were concerns. Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program eased these worries, offering $50 to $100 monthly.
Following the 5S principles helped me secure this scholarship. I encourage you to do the same. Counselors will ask questions based on the flyer attached.
Best of luck! Your dreams are closer than you think
22/2/24, 8:52 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

22/2/24, 8:53 AM - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
22/2/24, 8:53 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
22/2/24, 8:53 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
22/2/24, 8:53 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.

26/2/24, 9:41 AM - +263 77 302 0949: Ok thank you with the guidelines
26/2/24, 9:42 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that we will be beginning our new journey. From now onwards we will be having our session on a dedicated EWYL Line. Please save the EWYL Line contact number: +91 98107 89170.
26/2/24, 9:42 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say "I am a proud EDOOFIAN' on the EWYL line.
It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers.
26/2/24, 9:42 AM - Ananya Edoofa: It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, "I am a proud Edoofian.
26/2/24, 9:45 AM - +263 77 302 0949: will text starting tomorrow right
26/2/24, 9:46 AM - Ananya Edoofa: As a team, we are working towards having more efficient sessions, and therefore, we are making a new plan for our students along with a new platform for us.

Therefore, as soon as we finalize the new plan, I will share a new timetable with you. Meanwhile, I want you to keep working on your projects, and if you face any challenges, you can connect with me.
26/2/24, 9:47 AM - +263 77 302 0949: ok no problem will do so
26/2/24, 10:07 AM - +263 77 302 0949: is it the end of the session
