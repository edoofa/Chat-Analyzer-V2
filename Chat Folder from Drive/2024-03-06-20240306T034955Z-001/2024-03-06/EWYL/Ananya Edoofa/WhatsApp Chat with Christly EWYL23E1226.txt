12/2/24, 2:08 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
12/2/24, 2:09 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Can you please enlighten me about the two key objectives
12/2/24, 2:09 PM - +263 78 835 4179: It will be wonderful working with you all
12/2/24, 2:13 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
12/2/24, 2:13 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
12/2/24, 2:20 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Ok I get it
12/2/24, 2:20 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Wow , I understand that perfectly
12/2/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
12/2/24, 2:21 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Ok it's nice to meet to them, I am thrilled to be working with them
12/2/24, 2:22 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
12/2/24, 2:24 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Ues really interesting
12/2/24, 2:24 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Yes
12/2/24, 2:28 PM - +263 78 835 4179: I would go with the Moanday/Thursday sessions here
12/2/24, 3:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, we are ready to begin our new journey! Before that, I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

Because of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. As of now, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable. Meanwhile, you can keep working on your targets and keep me posted on your EWYL group.
12/2/24, 3:49 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Ok sure that's amazing and I would love to volunteer
13/2/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Christly!

I have observed that you have not been texting me at your session timings; it has always been me who drops a reminder message at your session time. Has your teacher ever dropped a reminder message to you before the class?
13/2/24, 2:07 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Hi, sorry my bad
13/2/24, 2:07 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Good afternoon
13/2/24, 2:35 PM - Ananya Edoofa: That's alright, however now that our session time is over, let us connect tomorrow at the same time. Have a good day ahead!🚀
13/2/24, 2:35 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Ok thank you
14/2/24, 1:31 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Good afternoon everyone
14/2/24, 1:36 PM - +263 78 835 4179: It's time for our session
14/2/24, 1:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Christly!

How are you doing? Are you ready for the session?🚀
14/2/24, 1:42 PM - +263 78 835 4179: I am fine thanks how are you
14/2/24, 1:42 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Yes sure we may proceed
14/2/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
14/2/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/2/24, 1:54 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Ok thank u lemme go through it
14/2/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
14/2/24, 2:12 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Yes it is, I would love to be there one day
14/2/24, 2:18 PM - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
14/2/24, 2:18 PM - +263 78 835 4179: I have a question though,  what is the test based on exactly
14/2/24, 2:18 PM - +263 78 835 4179: That sounds awesome
14/2/24, 2:19 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/2/24, 2:21 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Oooh ok I see, thank you, but are there ant specific areas that one needs to specialise in
14/2/24, 2:24 PM - Ananya Edoofa: No dear!
14/2/24, 2:24 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Ok thank you
14/2/24, 2:24 PM - +263 78 835 4179: That is all I had to ask for now
14/2/24, 2:26 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
14/2/24, 2:26 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/2/24, 2:27 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Yes sure
14/2/24, 2:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let us connect in our next session which is tomorrow at the same time. See you!🚀
14/2/24, 2:39 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Ok thank you, have a nice day

26/2/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *Using WhatsApp Community Groups for Outreach:*
*Step 1*: Create a WhatsApp group and name it using the format STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY. For example, if you're the mentor, it would be *MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY*.

*Step 2*: Find the right students for your group to ensure effective communication about Edoofa.

*Purpose*: The goal is to reach a broad audience, providing accurate information about Edoofa to prepare them for a smooth counseling session.
26/2/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Execution:

*Identify Potential Candidates:* - Reach out to students in Form 6 or those who have recently passed Form 6 (A-Level Examination).

*Connect with Form 6 Divisions*: - Assume there are 3 divisions in Form 6, each with around 20 students. Begin with one division. Connect with these students and request to be added to their official or unofficial WhatsApp group.

*Repeat the Process*: - Move on to the next divisions of Form 6, applying the same approach. In this way, you'll reach at least 60 students (3 divisions of Form 6).

*Extend to Form 5*: - Repeat the process in Form 5, targeting another 60 students.
26/2/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *Result*:

Preferred year of Admission:- 
August 2023 or August 2024 or August 2025
26/2/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/2/24, 2:04 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Ok I see but please may I get quick briefing about the execution part
26/2/24, 2:10 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, in order to move ahead with your second project, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
26/2/24, 2:10 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

Before we dive into today's session, here's a fun fact about parrots: Did you know that parrots are one of the few animal species that can mimic human speech? Some parrots, like the African grey parrot, have been known to learn hundreds of words and even use them in context! Isn't that amazing?🦜
27/2/24, 1:39 PM - +263 78 835 4179: That is really amazing,  I'm stunned

Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:
Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
27/2/24, 2:35 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Q1. Selukwe Chrome High School 
It is not connected with Edoofa 
Q2. I haven't figured that out yet, I am still trying to compile that
Q3. Midlands province
27/2/24, 2:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, that's all for today's session.. In the meantime, remember to start working on your projects. If you encounter any challenges along the way, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here to help.
27/2/24, 2:36 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Ok thank you , have a nice day
28/2/24, 1:27 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Christly!

Let us begin our session with another fact! 

_Did you know that there is a species of jellyfish that is biologically immortal? Yes, you heard that right! The Turritopsis dohrnii jellyfish can revert back to its juvenile form after reaching maturity, essentially resetting its life cycle. Imagine being able to hit the 'reset' button on life like that! If only we humans had the same ability on Mondays, right?_😅🪼
28/2/24, 1:28 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Good afternoon
28/2/24, 1:29 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Yes definitely on Mondays cause Mondays are something else
28/2/24, 1:40 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Haha, yes! Now that your school is not partnered with us,I would like you to connect with your School Head. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all your schoolmates.
28/2/24, 1:43 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Yes that will be wonderful,  I would really love to have all my schoolmates gettin access to the privledges that Edoofa offers
28/2/24, 1:45 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Yes! May I know if you have the Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him/her for your School Head’s Contact.
28/2/24, 1:48 PM - +263 78 835 4179: I have his contact number
28/2/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
28/2/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
28/2/24, 1:52 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Yes that is very true
28/2/24, 1:53 PM - +263 78 835 4179: I promise
28/2/24, 1:53 PM - +263 78 835 4179: It it is very advantageous
28/2/24, 1:57 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Mr Matatara.vcf (file attached)
