Also, don't forget to review what we covered last.🌟 <This message was edited>
22/2/24, 8:31 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Let us begin our session with an interesting fact: _Africa is home to the world's largest land mammal - the African elephant. These majestic creatures can weigh up to 6 metric tons (approximately 13,000 pounds) and are known for their intelligence, complex social structures, and remarkable memory. Isn't that incredible?_
22/2/24, 8:48 AM - +263 77 393 5053: Thank you , connected
22/2/24, 8:49 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
22/2/24, 9:05 AM - +263 77 393 5053: I assume that it is to be enrolled in to the university and to acquire points in the EWYL.
22/2/24, 9:09 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
22/2/24, 9:09 AM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
22/2/24, 9:24 AM - +263 77 393 5053: Understood
22/2/24, 9:32 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the EWYL team. 
Ms. Sanjana is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have Ms. Davi, Head coach is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
22/2/24, 9:39 AM - +263 77 393 5053: Thank you
22/2/24, 9:45 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let us connect tomorrow at the same time. Have a good day!🚀

26/2/24, 8:50 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 2 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
26/2/24, 9:42 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/2/24, 10:55 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Roy

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect today for our session. Our whole team was involved in an important meeting with Mr. Angad, where we discussed crucial strategies to enhance your skills and readiness for employment. I hope that together, we will work hard and fulfill our dreams.

Now that we cannot have our session as planned, let us connect tomorrow at 8:30 am. Have a good day ahead!
27/2/24, 11:46 AM - +263 77 393 5053: Ok
27/2/24, 3:06 PM - +263 77 393 5053: Good afternoon madam,         this is a summary of what I learned from the document:                             EWYL provides higher education which is affordable, accessible and makes you employable.                           Most businesses have moved online and online skills are needed to stay relevant in the industry.             You need to interact and build relations with the cooperate world on the net.                                         The 1st project is about building networks with potential employers and potential EDOOFA  partners.                                Professional network websites are required as well as good communicating skills and google sheets.             You have to build a resilient attitude when you are turned down.           You have to facilitate the connection and signing of contracts between EDOOFA  and the cooperate organizations.     You can use the aid of friends and relatives in acquiring connections.       Project 2.                              It's about reaching out and sharing about EDOOFA to aspiring students and making connections with school heads and principals.
27/2/24, 3:07 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Roy!

Good job! Also, during my discussion with Mr. Angad today, I realized the need for more efficient and effective sessions with my students to expedite our progress.

In light of this, I have decided to *reschedule our sessions to Monday through Friday from 1:30 PM to 3:00 PM*. This schedule change will ensure more productive sessions, and I look forward to seeing you tomorrow at the new time! <This message was edited>
27/2/24, 3:09 PM - +263 77 393 5053: Noted
28/2/24, 1:31 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Roy!

Let us begin our session with another fact! 

_Did you know that there is a species of jellyfish that is biologically immortal? Yes, you heard that right! The Turritopsis dohrnii jellyfish can revert back to its juvenile form after reaching maturity, essentially resetting its life cycle. Imagine being able to hit the 'reset' button on life like that! If only we humans had the same ability on Mondays, right?_😅🪼
28/2/24, 1:44 PM - +263 77 393 5053: Wow,I haven't heard of such.It's amazing really.
28/2/24, 1:45 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Indeed, Now,  I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
28/2/24, 1:46 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/2/24, 1:47 PM - +263 77 393 5053: Ok
28/2/24, 2:04 PM - +263 77 393 5053: I have finished listening to the audio.
28/2/24, 2:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
28/2/24, 2:23 PM - +263 77 393 5053: The 1st project is about cooperate alliance. The aim to understand the market I'm going to work in and prepare for it. I have to find companies in my region or country which are technologically driven and are digital in nature. I have to identify family and friends who works in the service sector who can help me with connections.I will be helped to prepare a linkedln account in order to connect to the company managers,organization leaders and human resource managers. I have to take their numbers and facilitate them meeting with the EDOOFA team.This will help to explore networks, get industrial exposure and enhance chances of getting a job.
28/2/24, 2:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let's conclude it here. We will reconnect tomorrow at 1:30 PM. Have a good day!🌱
28/2/24, 2:37 PM - +263 77 393 5053: Thank you, same to you.

29/2/24, 1:42 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/2/24, 1:43 PM - +263 77 393 5053: Ok
29/2/24, 1:46 PM - Ananya Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
29/2/24, 2:46 PM - +263 77 393 5053: The guideline for searching for companies. Looking for the right companies with willingness to  help Edoofians in overall development.The nature of the company to be considered as well as its history ,size,success, founder's background, financial stability among other crucial notes.Websites, Google as well as other social media platforms to be used where each is best applicable when searching for the company information.

29/2/24, 4:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, since our session time is over, let us conenct in our next session.
4/3/24, 1:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Roy!

Let us begin our session with a mind-blowing fact: The human brain is more active during sleep than it is while watching TV! While you're catching those Z's, your brain is busy processing memories, consolidating information, and even problem-solving. It's like a bustling city that never sleeps inside your head! So next time you're snoozing, remember, that your brain is hard at work.🧠😴
4/3/24, 2:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I was hoping to hear from you today, but since we couldn't connect, I'm looking forward to connecting with you positively tomorrow. Let's aim for a productive discussion then. Have a great day!
5/3/24, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Roy!

Let us begin our session with a giggle: 'Why did the scarecrow win an award?'

Because he was outstanding in his field!😅
5/3/24, 1:49 PM - +263 77 393 5053: Good afternoon noon madam, I'm sorry for the missed session yesterday it was caused by sharing the phone.
5/3/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Roy, I did not understand what sharing the phone meant. Could you please elaborate?
5/3/24, 1:54 PM - +263 77 393 5053: Ok,I wasn't the one in the possession of this cellphone during the time we were supposed to be on session,yesterday.
5/3/24, 1:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright! By the way,  this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
