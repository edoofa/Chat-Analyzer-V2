28/2/24, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tafadzwa!

Let us begin our session with another fact! 

_Did you know that there is a species of jellyfish that is biologically immortal? Yes, you heard that right! The Turritopsis dohrnii jellyfish can revert back to its juvenile form after reaching maturity, essentially resetting its life cycle. Imagine being able to hit the 'reset' button on life like that! If only we humans had the same ability on Mondays, right?_😅🪼
28/2/24, 1:38 PM - +263 71 781 6716: yeah
28/2/24, 1:43 PM - +263 71 781 6716: Haha! Indeed, Mondays would be much more bearable if we could hit the 'reset' button on life! 🤣 But seriously, the idea of a jellyfish that is biologically immortal is mind-boggling, and raises many interesting questions about the nature of life and death. It's quite fascinating to think that a living being could theoretically live forever! Have you ever wondered what it would be like to live forever? 🧐
28/2/24, 1:45 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Indeed, Now, before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?
28/2/24, 1:51 PM - +263 71 781 6716: Oky I'm very excited to introduce myself to you

Your goal to fulfill your desires and those of your father shows a strong sense of family commitment. Your passion for working in pharmaceutical companies and developing new drugs is impressive. Keep up the great work!
28/2/24, 2:00 PM - +263 71 781 6716: 🪢thank you very much. I'm hardworking boy and I have set a theme in my life which will guide me for the rest of my life .This theme says winners never quiets but quieters never wins .

28/2/24, 2:21 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing!
28/2/24, 2:21 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Tafadzwa, now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are? <This message was edited>
28/2/24, 2:24 PM - +263 71 781 6716: Yeah I think I do understand these two objectives
28/2/24, 2:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, now that our session time is over, let's conclude it here. We will reconnect tomorrow at 1:30 PM. Have a good day!🌱
28/2/24, 2:36 PM - +263 71 781 6716: Oky thank you for your time
29/2/24, 1:23 PM - +263 71 781 6716: Good afternoon
29/2/24, 1:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tafadzwa

I hope you are doing well. Are you ready to move ahead with our discussion?🚀
29/2/24, 1:34 PM - +263 71 781 6716: Yeah I'm doing well
29/2/24, 1:35 PM - +263 71 781 6716: 🪢 yeah I'm ready to move ahead
29/2/24, 1:41 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
29/2/24, 1:41 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
29/2/24, 1:44 PM - +263 71 781 6716: Yeah that's brilliant 
Awesome 👍
29/2/24, 1:47 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the EWYL team. 
Ms. Sanjana is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have Ms. Davi, Head coach is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
29/2/24, 1:51 PM - +263 71 781 6716: Thank you very much for introducing the team
29/2/24, 1:59 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 2 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
29/2/24, 2:02 PM - +263 71 781 6716: Yeah perfect
29/2/24, 2:04 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
29/2/24, 2:07 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/2/24, 2:07 PM - +263 71 781 6716: Oky oky no problem
29/2/24, 2:15 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
29/2/24, 2:18 PM - +263 71 781 6716: I have gone through it 
Tadiwanashe Gweshe is a genius  he participated in dancing competition and won the first price  along his fellow brothers Nigel , Tanaka ,Allan and DJ Kango
29/2/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great!I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
29/2/24, 2:22 PM - +263 71 781 6716: It sounds great

29/2/24, 8:33 PM - +263 71 781 6716: I understand that if these three projects are done well and all the tasks in each project have been completed the student will earn scholarship credits but the credits will be send straight to the university
1/3/24, 1:23 PM - +263 71 781 6716: Good afternoon

While you're catching those Z's, your brain is busy processing memories, consolidating information, and even problem-solving. It's like a bustling city that never sleeps inside your head! So next time you're snoozing, remember, that your brain is hard at work.🧠😴
