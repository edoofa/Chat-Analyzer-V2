22/2/24, 1:02 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Phadaless!

I can see that there is a slight delay in beginning our journey, however, it's just that I was so much occupied with the Africa trip preparations. I'm happy to share that our team just got back from an incredible event in Zimbabwe, and let me tell you, this time our Meet & Greet event was bigger and better! It was an amazing three-day event! 🎉

This time, it wasn't just Mr. Angad who went, but our whole admissions team, counseling team, and the program director joined in too!

Students and parents alike had the exclusive opportunity to dive deep into the exciting journey that awaits them in India. And guess what? Mr. Angad himself talked about exciting employment opportunities for everyone in India along with the EWYL plan. We also organized a special scholarship test for students who aren't part of the Edoofian community yet. 

I've got some photos to share with you. Get ready for a sneak peek into the excitement and energy of the event!

Also, we're planning to bring the excitement to Zambia too! So, get ready to embark on a journey filled with endless possibilities and boundless opportunities.

How are you doing? How was your weekend?🚀

My weekend was good how was yours
26/2/24, 8:57 AM - Ananya Edoofa: My weekend was amazing, finally after days of hard work, I got some rest and spent some quality time with my family.😅
26/2/24, 8:57 AM - +260 97 3906986: That's very nice
26/2/24, 8:57 AM - +260 97 3906986: So what are going to be doing today
26/2/24, 9:00 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
26/2/24, 9:01 AM - +260 97 3906986: No what are the
26/2/24, 9:04 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
26/2/24, 9:04 AM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
26/2/24, 9:06 AM - +260 97 3906986: Ohhhh I understand
26/2/24, 9:07 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the EWYL team. 
Ms. Sanjana is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have Ms. Davi, Head coach is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
26/2/24, 9:09 AM - +260 97 3906986: Okay am looking forward to meeting both of them as we go forward
26/2/24, 9:13 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 2 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
26/2/24, 9:14 AM - +260 97 3906986: Yes it does
26/2/24, 9:17 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
26/2/24, 9:17 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/2/24, 9:24 AM - +260 97 3906986: He is quite an expirenced and wise man
26/2/24, 9:26 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Indeed, So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
26/2/24, 9:27 AM - +260 97 3906986: The edoofa hall of inspiration
26/2/24, 9:29 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
26/2/24, 9:32 AM - +260 97 3906986: Yes it is quite a big deal
26/2/24, 9:37 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now that our session time is over, let us connect tomorrow at the same time. Meanwhile, I want you to read the document and share your understanding with me before our next session so that we can make the most out of it.

27/2/24, 3:07 PM - Ananya Edoofa: During my discussion with Mr. Angad today, I realized the need for more efficient and effective sessions with my students to expedite our progress.

In light of this, I have decided to *reschedule our sessions to Monday through Friday from 1:30 PM to 3:00 PM*. This schedule change will ensure more productive sessions, and I look forward to seeing you tomorrow at the new time!
27/2/24, 3:14 PM - +260 97 3906986: Okat thank you Ms Ananya
28/2/24, 1:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Phadaless!

Let us begin our session with another fact! 

_Did you know that there is a species of jellyfish that is biologically immortal? Yes, you heard that right! The Turritopsis dohrnii jellyfish can revert back to its juvenile form after reaching maturity, essentially resetting its life cycle. Imagine being able to hit the 'reset' button on life like that! If only we humans had the same ability on Mondays, right?_😅🪼
28/2/24, 1:35 PM - +260 97 3906986: Yeah if only 🤣🤣

28/2/24, 1:46 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/2/24, 1:46 PM - +260 97 3906986: Okay
28/2/24, 1:51 PM - +260 97 3906986: I have now understood that I must advertise what the edoofa program is all about and the benefits of being part of the program and allowing other people to have the opportunity that I have.
28/2/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/2/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly listen to this audio as well.

It has to be financially stable
I also have to get to know who founder of the company is. 
And some of the few steps taken to ensure the the company is the right one to for the program to be invested in.
28/2/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: You know what, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.

29/2/24, 2:18 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/2/24, 2:20 PM - +260 97 3906986: Okay noted
29/2/24, 2:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, in order to move ahead with your second project, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
29/2/24, 2:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.
