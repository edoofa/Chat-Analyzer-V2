7/1/24, 8:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called SLICE CON' 24 for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
7/1/24, 8:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the 8th, 9th, and 10th of January, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
15/1/24, 12:17 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Redemption

I hope you are doing well. I have noticed that you are not following your EWYL ritual on time. It is crucial for you to follow the ritual as it ensures that you do not miss out on any information and important posts. Kindly do it right now, and let us proceed with our session!

Now that your results are here, I hope you realize that you are one step closer to *your dream of studying in INDIA!* I understand there might be some challenges preventing you from attending your sessions regularly. However, why not step up and focus on financing your education while learning some valuable skills?

I've taken some time to discuss this with you. Remember, when you signed up for the EWYL program, you had aspirations for your life, including plans for earning and financing your education. I am confident that you still want to pursue those goals, right? I believe we can make your parents' investment worth it. What do you think? Isn't it the right time?⌛

The event went well , it was such an inspirational event
Being able to meet with the founder of Edoofa was such a good opportunity for me to understand the program better.
After watching the videos from our fellow Edoofians already in India i got motivated to put effort and i was very assured that I'm going to love coming there in India 
The event meant a lot to me , I became more proud to be an Edoofian.
I am looking forward to attending similar events in the future .
My parents trust in  Edoofa also grew and they are grateful to Edoofa for providing me with an amazing opportunity to study in India with affordable , quality education.
Unfortunately i wasn't able to  capture any photos since  i was rushing to go home.
All in all , i would like to say it was such an amazing experience
