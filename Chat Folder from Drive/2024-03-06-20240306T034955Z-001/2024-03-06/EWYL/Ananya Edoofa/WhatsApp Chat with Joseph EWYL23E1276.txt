28/2/24, 1:41 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Joseph!

Let us begin our session with another fact! 

_Did you know that there is a species of jellyfish that is biologically immortal? Yes, you heard that right! The Turritopsis dohrnii jellyfish can revert back to its juvenile form after reaching maturity, essentially resetting its life cycle. Imagine being able to hit the 'reset' button on life like that! If only we humans had the same ability on Mondays, right?_😅🪼
28/2/24, 1:47 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Yes you are right
28/2/24, 1:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
28/2/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/2/24, 1:55 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: I'm glad to meet you madam, I hope my education journey will be very fruitful when I work together with you
28/2/24, 1:59 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Based on the jelly fish, my question is, would you please share me the life cycle of a jelly fish?
28/2/24, 2:02 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Jellyfish start as tiny larvae called planulae. They attach to a surface and become polyps. Polyps bud off tiny jellyfish called medusae. These medusae grow into adult jellyfish, which release eggs and sperm into the water for reproduction. Jellyfish can live for different lengths of time, depending on the species.
28/2/24, 2:04 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Thanks madam
28/2/24, 2:04 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?
28/2/24, 2:12 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: I'm Joseph Jungubawa, I'm a Malawian, I studied my secondary school at Maranatha High school Academy, based on my passion I would like to be a Doctor, when it comes to my hobbies I like physical exercises and football.Interms of my goals, actually my short-term goal is get bachelor's degree in physiotherapy but my long-term goal is to get a PhD in physiotherapy
28/2/24, 2:14 PM - Ananya Edoofa: It's wonderful to learn more about you. Pursuing a career in medicine as a doctor is admirable, and your dedication to achieving this goal is commendable. Your passion for physical exercises and football shows a commitment to staying active and healthy, which is fantastic. It's great to hear about your goals, with your short-term aim of obtaining a bachelor's degree in physiotherapy and your long-term aspiration to earn a PhD in the field. Keep working hard towards your dreams, Joseph!
28/2/24, 2:15 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Thanks madam for your encouragement
28/2/24, 2:19 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I can see that some other people have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
28/2/24, 2:20 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: It's only my father
28/2/24, 2:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright! Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
28/2/24, 2:24 PM - +265 991 59 81 60: I am McJoseph the father of Joseph currently in Mzuzu North of Malawi
28/2/24, 2:26 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Yes, to learn working experience and also scholarship credits along the process of EWYL
28/2/24, 2:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let's conclude it here. We will reconnect tomorrow at 1:30 PM. Have a good day!🌱
28/2/24, 2:35 PM - +265 991 59 81 60: Thank you have a good day too
29/2/24, 1:30 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Good afternoon Madam
29/2/24, 1:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Joseph!

I hope you are doing well. Are you ready to move ahead with our discussion?🚀
29/2/24, 1:33 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: I'm doing well

I'm ready Madam
29/2/24, 1:39 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
29/2/24, 1:39 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
29/2/24, 1:46 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: I'm ready to work with you so as to meet the two objectives
29/2/24, 1:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the EWYL team. 
Ms. Sanjana is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have Ms. Davi, Head coach is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
29/2/24, 1:52 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Thanks Madam
I will waiting for you to introduce me
29/2/24, 2:02 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 2 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
29/2/24, 2:07 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Yes I'm ready to go though this process
29/2/24, 2:15 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
29/2/24, 2:15 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/2/24, 2:34 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Yes I have finish reading
29/2/24, 2:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now that our session time is over, let us connect in our next session which is tomorrow at 1:30 PM. Have a good day!🚀
29/2/24, 2:35 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Thanks madam
Good day to you too
1/3/24, 1:31 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Good afternoon madam
4/3/24, 8:09 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Joseph!

I hope you are doing well. Please excuse me for not being able to connect. Due to a family emergency, I was off for a day, and then it was the weekend.

Let us connect today at 1:30 PM to move ahead!
4/3/24, 8:19 AM - +265 883 80 68 83: Thanks madam
4/3/24, 8:19 AM - +265 883 80 68 83: It's OK we will connect by 1 30 pm
4/3/24, 1:30 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Gud afternoon madam
4/3/24, 1:31 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Joseph!

Let us begin our session with a mind-blowing fact: The human brain is more active during sleep than it is while watching TV! While you're catching those Z's, your brain is busy processing memories, consolidating information, and even problem-solving. It's like a bustling city that never sleeps inside your head! So next time you're snoozing, remember, that your brain is hard at work.🧠😴
4/3/24, 1:33 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: How're you doing Madam
4/3/24, 1:34 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: How is active during sleep time?
4/3/24, 1:35 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Would you please explain it madam I want to know
4/3/24, 1:41 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I could not understand your question, can you please help me?
4/3/24, 1:44 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: You said that a human brain is more active during sleep time, so I was I was asking how does that happen??

I was thinking that during sleep time the brain is at rest.
4/3/24, 1:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The human brain does indeed remain active during sleep, but it's important to note that this activity varies throughout the different stages of sleep. During REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, which is when most dreaming occurs, the brain's activity is actually quite similar to wakefulness in some aspects, including increased brain wave activity and processing of memories and emotions. However, during non-REM sleep, the brain's activity decreases compared to wakefulness, but it still engages in important functions such as memory consolidation and repair processes.

Comparing this to watching TV, where the brain is often in a more passive state, the statement highlights the dynamic nature of brain activity during sleep and emphasizes the significance of sleep for various cognitive processes. So, while it might seem like you're just resting during sleep, your brain is actually quite busy carrying out essential tasks.
4/3/24, 1:52 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Thanks madam I now understand
4/3/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
4/3/24, 1:58 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Section 2 mostly
4/3/24, 1:59 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
4/3/24, 1:59 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Yes in section 1
4/3/24, 2:00 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! So,  At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
4/3/24, 2:02 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: It sounds great madam
4/3/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
4/3/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
4/3/24, 2:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I was hoping to hear from your end, but since we couldn't connect, I'm looking forward to connecting with you positively tomorrow. Let's aim for a productive discussion then. Have a great day!
4/3/24, 3:01 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: I have finished it now
4/3/24, 3:02 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Thanks have a great day
5/3/24, 1:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Joseph!

Let us begin our session with a giggle: 'Why did the scarecrow win an award?'

Because he was outstanding in his field!😅
5/3/24, 1:34 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Good afternoon madam
5/3/24, 1:34 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: I'm ready we can
5/3/24, 1:37 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Madam what is a scarecrow, I would like to know please?
5/3/24, 1:45 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/3/24, 1:47 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Yes it helps farmers to chase pest in farm
5/3/24, 1:49 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, so this is called 'scarecrow'
5/3/24, 1:53 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Thanks I'm aware now
5/3/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, so did you get a chance to read the document?
5/3/24, 1:57 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Yes I'm mamaged to go through it
5/3/24, 2:00 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, that’s wonderful, Joseph! Now,  I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
5/3/24, 2:04 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: OK thanks
5/3/24, 2:04 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Wait I'm typing
5/3/24, 2:24 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: It is mostly associated with how a proud Edoofian can  display the projects of Edoofa to the world through education facilities or directly to friends, so as to make them part and parcel of Edoofa team,

For the process to be successful, there is use of internet platforms.

So a proud Edoofian gains the scholarship credits, as he or she is participating all the projects given,
For example for enloment of a single student 20 dollars is gained,

Successful completion of the student to be Member of Edoofa worths 30 dollars
5/3/24, 2:28 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: In the process of EWYL project skills like communication are gained, creativity thinking is also gained since some project there are not syllabus based.
5/3/24, 2:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I must say, Joseph, you have done a good job!🌟
5/3/24, 2:30 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Thanks madam
5/3/24, 2:39 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Since our session time is over, let's connect tomorrow at 1:30 PM.🤝🏼

God bless you!😇
5/3/24, 2:40 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Thanks madam
