28/12/23, 2:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Munyaradzi, definitely! You see, you have ample time, and you can earn enough scholarship credits to cover your tuition fees! You know, we have a star performer named Persistence; he has earned over 5000 USD and has paid his tuition fees through his credits.
28/12/23, 2:07 PM - +263 78 038 1173: That is great news though, I will work hard to get more credits

29/12/23, 1:44 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Wonderful, my student! So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
29/12/23, 1:44 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 1:47 PM - +263 78 038 1173: That is great news, thank you for your support in advance
29/12/23, 1:47 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?
29/12/23, 1:50 PM - +263 78 038 1173: My name is Munyaradzi Musa. I am a boy at the age of 19 and I am an athlete and a soccer player. I want to develop entrepreneurship skills to help the business world to grow bigger. In addition to that I managed to get 7 subjects at my O level.

2/1/24, 11:34 AM - +263 78 038 1173: How are you Ms Ananya
2/1/24, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Munyaradzi !

Before we dive into today's session, I'm curious – how was your New Year? Did you have a chance to celebrate and welcome the new chapter?
2/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 78 038 1173: I have celebrated a lot, I thank God for giving me another year to live
2/1/24, 1:43 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, it was good for me as well! 🌟
2/1/24, 1:44 PM - +263 78 038 1173: That side news though
2/1/24, 1:49 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
2/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Can you explain on objectives
2/1/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
2/1/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
2/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Noted
2/1/24, 1:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
2/1/24, 2:01 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Nice to meet you Ms Sanjana and Ms Davi
2/1/24, 2:04 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Thank you for your support
2/1/24, 2:09 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
2/1/24, 2:14 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Yes
2/1/24, 2:15 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
2/1/24, 2:15 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/1/24, 2:21 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Great news
2/1/24, 2:27 PM - Ananya Edoofa: As our session comes to a close, I appreciate our time together today. Let's wrap it up and look forward to continuing our discussion tomorrow at the same time. I'm excited to delve into more interesting topics and explore new ideas.

And now, here's a little humor to brighten your day: Why did the computer go to therapy? Because it had too many bytes of emotional baggage! 😄
2/1/24, 2:33 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Thank you Ms Ananya. This is very helpful
3/1/24, 1:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Munyaradzi! 🌞

Let's start the day with a bit of fun and mystery. Here's a riddle for you: 

'I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have nobody, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?'
3/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Wow wow 😂😂😂💯. Afternoon how are you Ms Ananya
3/1/24, 1:41 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, the correct answer is ECHO!😄
3/1/24, 1:43 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Ok thanks
3/1/24, 1:45 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
3/1/24, 1:51 PM - +263 78 038 1173: It is difficult for me too
3/1/24, 1:51 PM - +263 78 038 1173: All sections were amazing
3/1/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Absolutely! At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
3/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 78 038 1173: This sounds great Ms Ananya
3/1/24, 2:00 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
3/1/24, 2:00 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
3/1/24, 2:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I know we couldn't have a fruitful session today as I was preparing for something big coming up! I'll share it with you super soon. Meanwhile, let's conclude our session here and connect tomorrow at the same time!🤝🏽
3/1/24, 3:51 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Ok thank you Ms Ananya. I was facing network problem here
4/1/24, 1:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Munyaradzi!

How are you doing today? Shall we begin our session?

4/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 78 038 1173: We may proceed
4/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, did you get to read the document that was shared with you?
4/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Yes I have read the document
4/1/24, 2:02 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
4/1/24, 2:05 PM - +263 78 038 1173: The program will teach me relevant skills. The EWYL program may also make me aware about things and events that happen
4/1/24, 2:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, Great!  I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
4/1/24, 2:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
4/1/24, 2:06 PM - +263 78 038 1173: The program also provides me emerging skills
4/1/24, 2:08 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
4/1/24, 2:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, since our session time is over, let us connect tomorrow at the same time. I am so happy about your consistency. Maintain this, and I promise that we will excel in this program!
4/1/24, 2:38 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Ok the document is clarifying that I will be able to get in touch with big technological advanced companies.
4/1/24, 2:38 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Ok thank you Ms Ananya
5/1/24, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Munyaradzi!

5/1/24, 1:35 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Afternoon how are you Ms Ananya
5/1/24, 1:54 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I am good. So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
5/1/24, 1:54 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/1/24, 2:03 PM - +263 78 038 1173: The document is clarifying that as a student I have to carry out a research on the type of a company that is financially stable, with a strong founders background and qualifications. I can also you platforms like Google and LinkedIn
5/1/24, 2:05 PM - +263 78 038 1173: In addition to that the company should have a scale of 50 to 200 workers and the company should be either student-centric
5/1/24, 2:09 PM - Ananya Edoofa: You know what, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
5/1/24, 2:10 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Thank you Ms Ananya
5/1/24, 2:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –

5/1/24, 2:18 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/1/24, 2:21 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Noted
5/1/24, 4:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, kindly excuse me for not being able to proceed with our session. I was involved in a call with my students who will be presenting to prominent CEOs and entrepreneurs during a significant industrial visit scheduled for next week. Training them is crucial, especially since it's their first time participating in such an event.

As a result, I had to end our session 10 minutes earlier. We will reconnect in our next session, which is on Monday, as we do not hold sessions over the weekend. Wishing you a happy weekend!
5/1/24, 4:01 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Ok, noted
6/1/24, 1:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Munyaradzi!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
7/1/24, 11:16 AM - +263 78 038 1173: Great news though
11/1/24, 1:47 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Munyradazi!

Before beginning our session, I want to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that took place over the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! It was so happening, and I am delighted to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only that, but we also hosted various industrial leaders, and it went exceptionally well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech Made Easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.

12/1/24, 1:41 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Munyaradzi!

Let us begin our session with a fact! Did you know that the total weight of ants on Earth is comparable to the total weight of all the humans on this planet? It's a staggering reminder of the incredible diversity and abundance of life around us.🤯🐜
12/1/24, 1:46 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Afternoon how are you
12/1/24, 2:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
12/1/24, 2:02 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Ok it's fine then
12/1/24, 2:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
12/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Go ahead
12/1/24, 2:08 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
12/1/24, 2:08 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
12/1/24, 2:08 PM - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
12/1/24, 2:08 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
12/1/24, 2:08 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
12/1/24, 2:08 PM - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

12/1/24, 2:13 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Noted
12/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, in order to move ahead with your second project, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
12/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

12/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:
12/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
12/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
12/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
12/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
12/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.

Munyaradzi, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

In light of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. *Today, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable* and I am confident that together, we will create something truly extraordinary.

25/1/24, 1:25 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Munyaradzi!

I have some exciting news to share with you. Tomorrow, we are going to celebrate Republic Day! Now, let me tell you a bit about it.

Republic Day is a special day in India. It's a time when we remember and celebrate the day our country adopted its Constitution. Just like a constitution helps guide a country, ours outlines the rules and principles that make India the diverse and vibrant place it is.

On Republic Day, we have a big parade in the capital city, where people from all over the country come together to showcase our culture, traditions, and achievements. It's like a colorful and lively show with music, dance, and different displays. The Indian flag is hoisted, and everyone sings the national anthem with pride.

People also fly kites, dress up in traditional clothes, and enjoy delicious food! 🇮🇳✨

1/2/24, 4:09 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, bring your parents along, and don't miss your chance to expedite your admission process.
