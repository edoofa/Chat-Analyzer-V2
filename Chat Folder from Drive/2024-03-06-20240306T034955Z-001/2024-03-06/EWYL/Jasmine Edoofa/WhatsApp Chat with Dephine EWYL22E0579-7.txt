26/12/23, 2:41 PM - +27 73 417 1131: I have to create a WhatsApp group for students who would want to study abroad and inform them of the edoofa program .that is how it helps students fulfil their dreams of studying abroad. In the group I should also add my mentor which is you so that you can monitor the information that I will be sending in the group
26/12/23, 2:42 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Well Done Dephine, I am impressed with your understanding.
26/12/23, 2:42 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
26/12/23, 2:44 PM - +27 73 417 1131: Okay ma'am
26/12/23, 2:45 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.

2/1/24, 2:09 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I am very well. Thank you for asking 😊

Do you remember?
2/1/24, 2:10 PM - +27 73 417 1131: Yes ma'am
2/1/24, 2:13 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Please go ahead and answer these questions
2/1/24, 2:27 PM - +27 73 417 1131: First class high school.yes it's connected with edoofa.
2/1/24, 2:27 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Please go ahead
2/1/24, 2:29 PM - +27 73 417 1131: My school is located in Manicaland province
2/1/24, 2:36 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
2/1/24, 2:37 PM - +27 73 417 1131: I will introduce my self .then let them know about how I got the scholarship and my future aspirations. Then share the details about the edoofa program and ask them if I can schedule a call with edoofa program director
2/1/24, 2:38 PM - +27 73 417 1131: Yes ma'am
2/1/24, 2:40 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
2/1/24, 2:41 PM - +27 73 417 1131: Okay ma'am
2/1/24, 2:41 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
2/1/24, 2:42 PM - +27 73 417 1131: Yes ma'am .I am more than ready
2/1/24, 2:46 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_

I have been honored with the privilege of being selected for the Edoofa scholarship program. Through this incredible opportunity, I have been granted the chance to pursue my higher education in India, and what makes it even more remarkable is that this scholarship covers 50-100% of my educational expenses.

*Now, we will meet tomorrow for the session at 1:30 pm.* 
Till then take care and have a great day ahead!
3/1/24, 1:41 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Afternoon*
I hope you are doing well. Let us start our session with a fun question

If your pet could suddenly talk for one day, what do you think they would say or ask you?
3/1/24, 1:41 PM - +27 73 417 1131: Good afternoon miss jasmine
3/1/24, 1:43 PM - +27 73 417 1131: If my dog could talk, she would probably say "Take me on a walk!" She freaks out when we go on walks. She just gets so excited it's crazy. If my pet could talk, she would probably say, "Gimme some human food!"
3/1/24, 1:53 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: It sounds like your dog is the ultimate adventure enthusiast! The excitement for walks must be contagious
3/1/24, 1:53 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Last time we were discussing Project 3
Do you remember?
3/1/24, 2:00 PM - +27 73 417 1131: Yes ma'am
3/1/24, 2:10 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
3/1/24, 2:11 PM - +27 73 417 1131: Okay
3/1/24, 2:12 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:

1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
3/1/24, 2:13 PM - +27 73 417 1131: Okay
3/1/24, 2:24 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, Dephine- we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL.

I hope this message finds you well. In today's Wednesday lesson, we'll delve into the impactful realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and computer technology in the context of saving lives. We'll explore how innovative solutions are leveraging these technologies to make a significant difference in healthcare.

Furthermore, we'll discuss a noteworthy case study involving a startup from Zambia that has effectively translated the concept of using AI and computer technology into practical applications for improving healthcare outcomes. I encourage you to read the provided PDF carefully, as it promises to open your mind to multiple opportunities within this dynamic field.

While we were having multiple conversations with our students in the past few days for the meet & greet event, we figured that there is a slight confusion in the invitation dates. Hence, I wanted to quickly reach out and ensure that the same is not the case with you.

- As per the invitation, *you* are supposed to attend the event along with your parents on *19th of February* which is Monday.
 
- If you are recommending any of *your friends (Non Edoofians)* along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for *18th of February (8am/1pm) or 19th February(1pm)*. They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event.
17/2/24, 8:35 AM - Jasmine Edoofa: Please ensure that you are present at the venue 30 minutes earlier and are dressed appropriately.
Don't forget to carry your admit card!

Cannot wait to see you there tomorrow! Hope you're excited too! 😃🕺🏻
