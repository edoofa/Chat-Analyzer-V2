26/12/23, 2:55 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -

26/12/23, 2:56 PM - +263 78 085 4090: Well
26/12/23, 2:56 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.

Not connected


Will share


Midlands south province
28/12/23, 2:28 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
28/12/23, 2:29 PM - +263 78 085 4090: Yes
28/12/23, 2:31 PM - +263 78 085 4090: I agree
28/12/23, 2:34 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.

Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
28/12/23, 2:35 PM - +263 78 085 4090: Oky 

Will look for it
28/12/23, 2:39 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
28/12/23, 2:40 PM - +263 78 085 4090: Yes
28/12/23, 2:40 PM - +263 78 085 4090: But l haven't get the headmaster's number yet
28/12/23, 2:41 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, First let me explain the project dear
28/12/23, 2:42 PM - +263 78 085 4090: Well
28/12/23, 2:44 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_

5/1/24, 2:42 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: This means that half of the tuition or more fees for the academic program will be covered by the scholarship, and you will be responsible for the remaining 50% or less.

5/1/24, 2:55 PM - +263 71 400 1474: Oky
5/1/24, 2:56 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you go through all the information, and see that this can be a million opportunities for your school, then please help me fill out the form so that the Program Director of Edoofa can contact you.

*School Details*:

1. School Name: 
2. School Province: 
3. Name of the contact person: 
4. Designation of the contact person:
5. Whatsapp Number:
6. Year of the establishment of the School: 
7. Pass% of A level (Last Academic year): 
8. No. of teachers in School:
9. The number of students in A level: 
10. Fee structure in A level (Per Term in USD): 
11. Date of Call:
12. Time of the scheduled meeting (CAT):


*Details submitted by*:
1. Full Name:
2. EWYL Group Name: 
3. How did you get to know about the school and what did you discuss with the contact person?
5/1/24, 3:00 PM - +263 71 400 1474: I'm the one to submit the details right
5/1/24, 3:08 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: No, you have to share this application with the headmaster, and they have to fill in the form
5/1/24, 3:12 PM - +263 71 400 1474: Oky
5/1/24, 3:14 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
5/1/24, 3:20 PM - +263 71 400 1474: Ohh oky
5/1/24, 3:20 PM - +263 71 400 1474: Why
5/1/24, 3:21 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:

1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
5/1/24, 3:22 PM - +263 71 400 1474: I see

16/2/24, 3:10 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Olivia!

While we were having multiple conversations with our students in the past few days for the meet & greet event, we figured that there is a slight confusion in the invitation dates. Hence, I wanted to quickly reach out and ensure that the same is not the case with you.

- As per the invitation, *you* are supposed to attend the event along with your parents on *17th of February* which is tomorrow. 
- If you are recommending any of *your friends (Non-Edoofians)* along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for *18th of February (8am/1pm) or 19th  February (1pm)*. They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event.

16/2/24, 3:11 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Please ensure that you are present at the venue 30 minutes earlier and are dressed appropriately.
Don't forget to carry your admit card!

Cannot wait to see you there tomorrow! Hope you're excited too! 😃🕺🏻
