08/12/23, 8:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

I am here to begin with the session,

Shall we begin the session?
08/12/23, 8:45 am - +263 71 459 3605: Yes let's begin
08/12/23, 8:45 am - +263 71 459 3605: Good morning
08/12/23, 8:49 am - +263 71 696 6271: Good morning

08/12/23, 9:07 am - +263 71 459 3605: Oky will definitely let you know
08/12/23, 10:19 am - +263 71 459 3605: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 10:19 am - +263 71 459 3605: Got the picture
08/12/23, 10:21 am - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing these, Please let me know why the grades are low?
08/12/23, 10:43 am - +263 71 459 3605: On an honest note I would take full blame for the low marks in biology I didn't really understand a lot of biological terms though it's my favorite subject I also had poor answering techniques at times I will be knowing the answer but fail to express it in geography our teachers got changed during the course of which we hadn't done the whole physical geography part and not yet started human geography so the new teacher made us write a full paper to test our ability then crop science my teacher had a leg injury didn't come to school and had to take a maternity leave after that so we wrote what we knew in the test
08/12/23, 10:47 am - Pallika Edoofa: I understand that Kudakwashe, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
08/12/23, 10:47 am - Pallika Edoofa: Also, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
08/12/23, 10:49 am - +263 71 459 3605: Im confident I will get the required passes
08/12/23, 10:49 am - +263 71 459 3605: No I haven't done that
08/12/23, 10:51 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 10:53 am - +263 71 459 3605: Thank for let me go through it
08/12/23, 10:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Please let me know once done
08/12/23, 11:11 am - +263 71 459 3605: Oky I will let u know
08/12/23, 11:28 am - +263 71 459 3605: I have read through thank you for sharing this information
08/12/23, 11:30 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Kudakwashe
08/12/23, 11:43 am - +263 71 459 3605: Yeah
08/12/23, 11:44 am - Pallika Edoofa: Kudakwashe, I would like to know that if you were interested in Medical field, so, why haven't you opted Chemistry and Physics in you A Level?
08/12/23, 11:47 am - +263 71 459 3605: I
That's because I had a D in both subjects during my O level
08/12/23, 11:57 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, I do understand!!

Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
08/12/23, 12:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since you do not have Physics and Chemistry, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine and Pharmacy, but considering your interest there are better courses from the Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help fulfill your dreams of working in this field

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
08/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 71 459 3605: We not aware of that
08/12/23, 1:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Kudakwashe, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
08/12/23, 1:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 1:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.



*So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?*
08/12/23, 1:49 pm - +263 71 459 3605: During the semester do students take breaks and go back to Zimbabwe
08/12/23, 1:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes Kudakwashe
08/12/23, 1:53 pm - +263 71 459 3605: So the $2000-$3000 per year can you please break it down for me
08/12/23, 1:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: They will be having the summer and the winter break in which they can go back to Zimbabwe and visit their families.

If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
