You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
05/12/23, 4:12 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.

06/12/23, 11:03 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Tanaka, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
06/12/23, 11:03 am - +263 78 591 8462: Ohk I will definitely do that
06/12/23, 11:04 am - Harmehak: Yes please
06/12/23, 11:11 am - +263 78 591 8462: Ohk..well
I did my O level at Zimbabwe Republic Police high school and I did reasonably  well and i  then enrolled at Chipindura for my A level...I did Mathematics, biology and chemistry and by the grace of God I would like to study medicine and I would like to become a Gyenacolgist one day....
I am not sure of my strengths but my weakness is lack of confidence to express myself ,my hobby is playing basketball.

My parents are civil servants,my mother is a teacher and my father is a police officer and I have two siblings
06/12/23, 11:17 am - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed, Tanaka, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself please.

May I know more about your siblings please?
06/12/23, 11:20 am - +263 78 591 8462: Thank you
I have a little brother who is doing form2 at Chipindura high school and a little sister who is grade 5
06/12/23, 11:26 am - Harmehak: Duly noted please, Tanaka!
06/12/23, 11:26 am - Harmehak: What subjects does your mother teach please?
06/12/23, 11:27 am - +263 78 591 8462: She is a primary school teacher who teaches ICT
06/12/23, 11:45 am - Harmehak: Alright please, Tanaka
06/12/23, 11:45 am - Harmehak: Well Tanaka now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
06/12/23, 11:51 am - +263 78 591 8462: I really believe its life changing because studying abroad will help me gain experience and confidence and the fact that I  have studied abroad will put me at an advantage of being recognised as more than capable
06/12/23, 12:20 pm - Harmehak: Well put across, Tanaka.

So would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
06/12/23, 12:24 pm - +263 78 591 8462: I am not quite sure about being mentally prepared because I have never gone out of the country before and away from my mother for long ...And judging from my confidence I am very scared
06/12/23, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: I understand your concerns, Tanaka.

However what exactly are your concerns?
06/12/23, 12:36 pm - +263 78 591 8462: I am scared of racism to be honest and communication
06/12/23, 12:45 pm - Harmehak: You donot have to worry about the same as having had 2000 student under the program, we haven't been reported one case of racism please.

And English is a common language, Tanaka.
06/12/23, 12:47 pm - +263 78 591 8462: Alright thank you for the reassurance.
06/12/23, 12:55 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
06/12/23, 12:59 pm - Harmehak: I would be more than happy to connect you with students as well later in the process.
06/12/23, 1:00 pm - Harmehak: So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially please?
06/12/23, 1:02 pm - +263 78 591 8462: Yes .my family members are aware ,and I think my mother is willing to support in any way
06/12/23, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: That's great.
06/12/23, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
06/12/23, 1:23 pm - +263 78 591 8462: I am confident that's I will get good points
06/12/23, 1:34 pm - Harmehak: That's great
06/12/23, 1:34 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study medicine ?
06/12/23, 2:58 pm - +263 78 591 8462: Alright but I only have my result slip,I haven't yet collected my certificate
06/12/23, 3:04 pm - Harmehak: You can share the result slip.

However do ensure active participation.
06/12/23, 3:05 pm - +263 78 591 8462: Ohh am sorry for the late late reply
06/12/23, 3:05 pm - Harmehak: I understand.
06/12/23, 3:07 pm - +263 78 591 8462: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 3:14 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted,

I receive the response to the other part.
06/12/23, 3:23 pm - +263 78 591 8462: Studying medicine has always been my passion . I just want to be able to save a life one day
06/12/23, 3:31 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, Tanaka 

So did you ever happen to research about the requirements for Medicine too?
06/12/23, 3:33 pm - +263 78 591 8462: I have not yet researched
06/12/23, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
06/12/23, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
06/12/23, 3:35 pm - +263 78 591 8462: Alright. So how well should you do in these subjects
06/12/23, 3:52 pm - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy*
06/12/23, 4:39 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response however it seems you are occupied, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

07/12/23, 9:41 am - Harmehak: Yes please, Tanaka.
07/12/23, 9:43 am - +263 78 591 8462: Ohh alright 
So for the above programs how many points should I have
07/12/23, 9:52 am - Harmehak: Did you go through the same please?
07/12/23, 9:54 am - +263 78 591 8462: Yes I went through it..I thought maybe for each good program there are certain points that are needed
07/12/23, 9:54 am - Harmehak: I do understand Tanaka,

07/12/23, 11:07 am - +263 78 591 8462: I will study cardiovascular technology
07/12/23, 11:29 am - Harmehak: Alright then Tanaka, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
07/12/23, 11:38 am - +263 78 591 8462: Well I think I will be able to get a job and pursue my studies and I will be able to help my parents financially.
I think Edoofa will help me in enabling my ability to show the world that I can do my best
07/12/23, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Tanaka, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
07/12/23, 12:09 pm - +263 78 591 8462: I think studying abroad will put me at an advantage when I will be looking for a job since universities abroad are fully recognized
07/12/23, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: That is wonderful Tanaka

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
07/12/23, 12:18 pm - +263 78 591 8462: I have not yet researched but I heard from other people that India is best in Sciences education and since it is the best it's not difficult to find a job
07/12/23, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: I do understand, Tanaka

07/12/23, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: Did you thoroughly follow the shared resources, Tanaka?
07/12/23, 12:48 pm - +263 78 591 8462: Yes I did Ms Harmehak
07/12/23, 12:48 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you, Tanaka.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
07/12/23, 12:54 pm - +263 78 591 8462: No  i am not familiar with that information
07/12/23, 1:08 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
07/12/23, 1:08 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
07/12/23, 1:08 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
07/12/23, 1:08 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
07/12/23, 1:08 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 1:31 pm - +263 78 591 8462: I see .So we pay for our own accommodation right but do we find the accommodation on our own
07/12/23, 1:32 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
07/12/23, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: Tanaka, let me help you have better clarity about the same please.

For us every student is like our family, Parents send their child for higher education on a belief that Edoofa Program will be there to take good care of their child during the course of their education itself, and because of that for us, student's safety and security is the utmost priority. Due to this itself, the student's accommodation is done on the University Campus itself, as the University campus is the most secure place any student can find, while their higher education itself.
07/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 591 8462: Alright I  am reassured now
07/12/23, 1:55 pm - Harmehak: Please?
07/12/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 591 8462: Yes that is affordable
07/12/23, 3:09 pm - Harmehak: I am glad.
07/12/23, 3:09 pm - Harmehak: Tanaka, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
07/12/23, 3:18 pm - +263 78 591 8462: Yes I do agree
07/12/23, 3:50 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Tanaka?
07/12/23, 3:55 pm - +263 78 591 8462: Yes I really do
07/12/23, 4:00 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
07/12/23, 4:00 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
07/12/23, 4:00 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
07/12/23, 4:00 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

07/12/23, 4:00 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 4:14 pm - +263 78 591 8462: I am not quite sure I understand this same
07/12/23, 4:20 pm - Harmehak: These are the examples of projects performed under the Earn While You Learn Program.
07/12/23, 4:29 pm - +263 78 591 8462: Ohh alright .
07/12/23, 4:29 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
07/12/23, 4:39 pm - +263 78 591 8462: Thats is nice .I would be happy to be part of it
07/12/23, 4:40 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

07/12/23, 4:44 pm - +263 78 591 8462: Yes I understand  very much
07/12/23, 4:46 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
07/12/23, 4:48 pm - +263 78 591 8462: Yes  i am ready
07/12/23, 5:06 pm - Harmehak: Tanaka, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
07/12/23, 5:06 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
07/12/23, 5:09 pm - +263 78 591 8462: they will end up spending$1500-$2250
07/12/23, 5:19 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
07/12/23, 5:19 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
07/12/23, 5:19 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 5:19 pm - Harmehak: You see,Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
07/12/23, 5:24 pm - +263 78 591 8462: Yes I think so
07/12/23, 5:30 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
07/12/23, 5:30 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
07/12/23, 5:32 pm - +263 78 591 8462: That's is reasonable
07/12/23, 5:34 pm - Harmehak: Indeed please
07/12/23, 5:35 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
07/12/23, 5:35 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 5:35 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
07/12/23, 5:35 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
07/12/23, 5:38 pm - +263 78 591 8462: Yes I understood
07/12/23, 5:40 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
07/12/23, 5:40 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
07/12/23, 5:40 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

07/12/23, 5:48 pm - +263 78 591 8462: Alright I see
07/12/23, 5:49 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
07/12/23, 5:49 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

07/12/23, 5:58 pm - +263 78 591 8462: Alright thank you
07/12/23, 6:06 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
07/12/23, 6:06 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
07/12/23, 6:06 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

07/12/23, 6:06 pm - Harmehak: Dear Tanaka,

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. Tomorrow, on “07-12-23” at 10:30 P.M. CAT, I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, *Senior Career Counselor Mr Sahil would be getting in touch*, we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!

I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

Are we good to proceed with your application now?
