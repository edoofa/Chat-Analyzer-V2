04/12/23, 12:37 pm - +27 67 235 2935: Well as a student I did my research and found out that India is a country with a diverse cultural heritage with a history dating back thousands of years. As a student it made me realise that studying in India could provide an immersive experience of this rich cultural diversity, allowing an international student like me to learn and appreciate different traditions,customs and practices.

However one of the main reasons behind my desire to study in India is to pursue my career. As I had mentioned in my description about myself  that I want to become a Paediatrician doctor,my research shows that skilled and efficient Paediatricians are highly in demand in India as about 26 million children are born in India every year.

I also discovered that Pediatrics is a good profession in India as it works well in both rural as well as urban India which could give me an opportunity to explore a new environment while showcasing my skills 😌
Above all I believe that if given the opportunity to go study abroad,it would be a great opportunity that would allow me to develop new skills and techniques in a different environment
04/12/23, 12:41 pm - +27 67 235 2935: As I had mentioned in description about myself, I recently completed my grade 12 on the 29th of November 2023 and I am currently waiting for my final results which will be released in January 2024
04/12/23, 12:46 pm - +27 67 235 2935: I will send  the pictures shortly🙃
04/12/23, 1:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I truly admire your vision, Trish! Exposure to foreign tertiary education offers numerous advantages. It broadens students' horizons by introducing them to diverse cultures and perspectives, improving language skills, and providing a global outlook. They gain access to world-class academic institutions, form international networks, and develop invaluable personal and professional skills. This experience fosters personal growth, enhances career prospects, and cultivates global citizenship. In essence, studying abroad is a transformative journey that equips students with the knowledge, skills, and perspective needed to thrive in our interconnected world!
04/12/23, 1:19 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Trish. I will be waiting for your response.
04/12/23, 1:27 pm - +27 67 235 2935: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 1:29 pm - +27 67 235 2935: Absolutely true 😌🤝
04/12/23, 2:13 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Thank you for sharing, Trish. I truly appreciate your sincerity! Can you please brief me regarding your career aspirations more vividly?
04/12/23, 2:49 pm - +27 67 235 2935: Well as a student that desires to become a Paediatrician, I researched more about this career before I fell in love with it and to also acquire knowledge about it . A Paediatrician doctor is a medical  that provides a health care service for infants and young children.They specialise in many areas and they are trained to diagnose and treat common illnesses from minor health problems to serious diseases in children.
What inspired me to consider this career is the love I have for children. I have experience with babysitting children and I found infants, toddlers and children funny and filled with bright energy even though they can be a lot of work but I understood from the very moment I decided to pursue Pediatrics as a career that this job is meaningful and respected  .

In the year 2022,we had a career week at school and I happened to meet a Paediatrician who inspired me more. She explained to me that being a Paediatrician doctor is more than just treating illnesses. She mentioned that watching children grow, change and also ensuring that children are achieving milestones in their growth, behaviour and skills is a rewarding experience to every Paediatrician doctor.

I have researched characteristics and skills required to become a Paediatrician which includes
Good communication skills
Compassion
Problem solving skills
A way with working with kids and be very observant which I am confident that I portrait all of these skills.😌

From my perspective, pursuing this career will allow me to build relationships with families and see children grow over the years. This will give me an opportunity to share my expertise and also  allow me as a Paediatrician doctor to help the families resolve concerns that they have about their children and ensure that their children are healthy 😌
04/12/23, 3:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Your expressed desire to work in the healthcare sector is truly commendable and reflects a deep sense of compassion and dedication to making a positive impact on people's lives. Your commitment to contributing to the well-being of others through a career in healthcare showcases not only your professional aspirations but also a genuine concern for the welfare of the community. The healthcare field greatly benefits from individuals like you who bring a combination of empathy, resilience, and a strong sense of responsibility. Your decision to embark on this path indicates a noble intention to be part of a sector that plays a vital role in enhancing the quality of life for individuals and communities at large, Trish! However, could you please share why you didn't pursue Biology in your 12th Grade? I believe it is a very crucial science/medical subject, isn't it?
04/12/23, 3:44 pm - +27 67 235 2935: I did pursue biology but in South Africa they call it Life Sciences 😌
04/12/23, 3:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand, Trish. Could you kindly provide information on the specific subjects that fall under the category of "Physical Sciences"?
04/12/23, 4:00 pm - +27 67 235 2935: Physical sciences is divided into two parts here in South Africa
The first part is physics and the second part is Chemistry
04/12/23, 4:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, if you had researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India, he/she has to crack the entrance exam, NEET, which selects only a limited number of students from a vast pool of applicants. NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test) is challenging due to its comprehensive syllabus, fierce competition, and the need to excel in Biology, Physics, and Chemistry, making it a demanding examination for aspiring medical students.
04/12/23, 4:20 pm - +27 67 235 2935: If I may ask Mr Shashwat,does that mean I will be writing the entrance exam ?
04/12/23, 4:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Trish. Since the Medical Industry is humongous, there are a plethora of courses that are extremely intrinsic for the Medical Industry to function, and you will be glad to know that they align with your Grade 12 subjects as well! Shall I brief you regarding the courses?
04/12/23, 4:22 pm - +27 67 235 2935: Yes please 🙃
04/12/23, 4:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: The courses that you could pursue which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

04/12/23, 4:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Physiotherapy

Provided with physiotherapy as a career option, with determination to make my dream a reality  I  see myself in the next 5 years as a successful, hardworking physiotherapist  that  would have made a lot of positive impacts on the lives of people.

Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
04/12/23, 9:13 pm - +27 67 235 2935: No I'm not familiar with that
04/12/23, 9:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Trish! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
04/12/23, 9:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 9:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, If a student meets and exceeds our academic criteria with a high passing grade, he/she becomes eligible for an exclusive scholarship. With the exclusive Scholarship, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1600-$2300, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc!
04/12/23, 9:16 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
04/12/23, 9:24 pm - +27 67 235 2935: To be honest Mr Shashwat, I feel like my family won't be able to fully afford the fee even though it is reduced. As a student , looking at my parent's current professions ,it might be very difficult to afford the fee along the way of my journey
04/12/23, 9:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know what part of the fees is not affordable, please?
04/12/23, 9:28 pm - +27 67 235 2935: To be honest Mr Shashwat, everything accept the food and the accomodation I think
04/12/23, 9:31 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have read this message, please?
04/12/23, 9:35 pm - +27 67 235 2935: Oh I'm very sorry,I didn't understand the message but I understand now 😌🤝and I believe I can  meet and exceed your academic criteria  with a high passing grade😊 I'm very sorry for the misunderstanding
04/12/23, 9:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Trish. Our support doesn't stop there! Edoofa also offers an innovative *Earn While You Learn Program*. This program allows you to further reduce your remaining fees by gaining practical work experience while studying. It not only eases the financial burden but also provides you with valuable skills and industry exposure, enhancing your employability and ensuring a well-rounded education.

With *Edoofa's* exclusive Scholarship and the opportunity to earn while you learn, you can focus on your studies, explore your field of interest, and prepare for a successful career.

So do you want me to guide you about the *Earn while you learn* program in depth?
04/12/23, 9:38 pm - +27 67 235 2935: Yes please Mr Shashwat 🤗
04/12/23, 9:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Trish. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
04/12/23, 9:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
04/12/23, 9:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
04/12/23, 9:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
04/12/23, 9:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
04/12/23, 9:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
04/12/23, 9:48 pm - +27 67 235 2935: From my  view I think that this opportunity that the EWYL provides is great as it creates more platforms that allows students to develop and gain more knowledge and experience and creating an environment where students can showcase their skills. I think that this will be beneficial for me as I will be exposed to different environments with different people that teach and pass on new and creative skills and providing more experience
04/12/23, 9:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2000 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $60-$90 a month
04/12/23, 9:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
04/12/23, 9:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2000, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1000 in the first semester and $1000 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
04/12/23, 9:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

04/12/23, 9:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how you can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on your parents?
04/12/23, 9:58 pm - +27 67 235 2935: Yes Mr Shashwat I realise it and the opportunities that come along with the EWYL program
04/12/23, 9:58 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
04/12/23, 9:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
04/12/23, 9:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
04/12/23, 10:09 pm - +27 67 235 2935: Wow, To be honest I appreciate all the points 🤝😌 I honestly feel like the Edoofa program is doing an outstanding job
04/12/23, 10:10 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Trish! May I know which one is your favourite, please?
04/12/23, 10:12 pm - +27 67 235 2935: My favourite has to number 4.Higher Education Concierge 🤗
04/12/23, 10:14 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Trish. One of the most reassuring things about being an *Edoofian* is that we, here at *Edoofa*, always have your back!
04/12/23, 10:14 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
04/12/23, 10:14 pm - +27 67 235 2935: I'm glad to hear that 🤗
04/12/23, 10:21 pm - +27 67 235 2935: My family feels excited and they are very supportive but also curious, nervous and protective at the same time..
The reason behind these mixed emotions is because considering the distance and the fact that I will be in an environment that they are not familiar with  kind of contributes to those mixed emotions but certainly they are willing to be supportive with my journey as they realise that I will be studying in a country with great opportunities that will empower me to become successful and with incredible support from the Edoofa program 🤗
04/12/23, 10:23 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can conclude that you are diligent and possess extreme valor. You will surely prove your mettle if provided with the right path. Moreover, Edoofa is a big family, and I can assure you that you will never feel like an outcast or out of place! Furthermore, Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
04/12/23, 10:23 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Moreover, As *Edoofa* we also prioritize a student's security! That is the reason we are the most trusted organization in Africa with a community of more than 4000 students! Furthermore, after the session, I will connect you with a few of the students who are currently studying in India with us, so that you and your parents can connect with them!
04/12/23, 10:25 pm - +27 67 235 2935: I'm looking forward to that👌😌
04/12/23, 10:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
04/12/23, 10:29 pm - +27 67 235 2935: All of the above is absolutely true
04/12/23, 10:35 pm - +27 67 235 2935: If I may ask, is the application fees, language proficiency test score and an interview also required when applying for a university abroad?
04/12/23, 10:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 10:40 pm - +27 67 235 2935: Have a blessed night 🤗
05/12/23, 8:39 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"Success is not a destination; it's a journey of continuous improvement and self-discovery." - Brian Tracy*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
05/12/23, 8:56 am - +27 67 235 2935: Good morning 🤗Mr Shashwat, I'm ready
05/12/23, 9:28 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Trish!
05/12/23, 9:28 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
05/12/23, 9:28 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
05/12/23, 9:28 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 9:28 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
05/12/23, 9:38 am - +27 67 235 2935: Wow, This is exciting news Mr Shashwat 🤗
05/12/23, 10:00 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Grade 12 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their Grade 12 result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final Grade 12 results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
05/12/23, 10:00 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
05/12/23, 10:07 am - +27 67 235 2935: These are great offers and very affordable🤝
05/12/23, 10:13 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
05/12/23, 10:28 am - +27 67 235 2935: Well so far I understood that as the Edoofa program helps reduce the fees to an affordable price. I find it incredible how the enrollment fee of $350  covers all the educational facilities such as the Visa documentation, statement of purpose for multiple universities and etc which would have been more expensive if we had to do it alone.
One of the amazing things I have liked ,is phase 2 of the enrollment process. This will will prepare me as a student to work hard so I can earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before my grade 12 results are out. It's great that I would be doing something productive and gaining experience while waiting for my grade 12 results.
I appreciate how the Edoofa considers the African Nation's economic instability by providing solutions on how parents can access flexible fee payment options
05/12/23, 10:49 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc! If you are found eligible for a higher quantum of scholarship, the cost of education will be reduced  to $1600-$2300 per annum
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
05/12/23, 10:59 am - +27 67 235 2935: I understand Mr Shashwat 🤗These are good offers
05/12/23, 11:12 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 11:16 am - +27 67 235 2935: Phase I 😊
05/12/23, 11:19 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Bravo! We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
05/12/23, 11:24 am - +27 67 235 2935: You may explain Mr Shashwat 🤗
05/12/23, 11:26 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$1000) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
05/12/23, 11:36 am - +27 67 235 2935: I understand Mr Shashwat,can you plz explain step again, about the registration fee
05/12/23, 11:36 am - +27 67 235 2935: **step 6
05/12/23, 11:37 am - +27 67 235 2935: Eish I'm sorry,I meant step 5
05/12/23, 12:19 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Trish. This registration fee isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself!
05/12/23, 12:19 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
05/12/23, 12:19 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

05/12/23, 12:26 pm - +27 67 235 2935: I believe I have no questions

06/12/23, 9:49 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mrs. Patience!
06/12/23, 9:50 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Trish! Can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
06/12/23, 9:58 am - +27 67 235 2935: Yes I am clear about everything so 

1.Bachelor of Science in Physiotherapy

2.India

3.$6000-$8000

4.$2000-$3000

5.$350

6.seven days

7.yes, it's very clear
06/12/23, 10:00 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Are your parents ready for the same, please?
06/12/23, 10:01 am - +27 67 235 2935: I believe they are 🤗
06/12/23, 10:01 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can they please acknowledge this using voice notes?
06/12/23, 10:04 am - +27 62 499 0315: This message was deleted
06/12/23, 10:06 am - +27 62 499 0315: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 10:13 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
06/12/23, 10:13 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
06/12/23, 10:14 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.

06/12/23, 10:14 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 11th  or 12th December 2023 for $200 and the 11th  or 12th of January  for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 11th  or 12th December 2023. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
06/12/23, 10:26 am - +27 62 499 0315: Well Mr Shashwat i have read everything and we had discussed the financial aspects together as a family and we opt for number 1.   As Trish's parents we are willing to work hard so we can provide the required amount before the deadline

My family and I have discussed about the Time and we found out that the only available  time would be on Friday around 6pm  where me and both my parents would be present but we also figured that if the session of the video call needs to be done at the earliest then my mother and I will be available tomorrow and my father will not be present due to his working hours,I don't know if that is fine with you sir . And sir one last problem is that due to the phone problems that we have ,is it ok if we opt to voice calls?
I humbly apologize once again 🙏🏻
