23/11/23, 11:17 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
23/11/23, 11:17 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *EDOOFA has praised the new government for its strong commitment and positive reforms in the education sector.*

The elimination of school fees, increase in the number of teachers, and keeping vulnerable learners, especially adolescent girls, in school are some of the notable positive reforms.
After our successful visit to Zambia and meetings at the Ministries, we have already begun conducting Scholarship Tests and Counseling Sessions at eminent schools in Zambia. Also, *Edoofa is looking for deserving candidates who are meritorious and seek affordable education in the world’s second-largest higher education space.*

Our strong partnerships with educational institutions like *Penmal Connect Ltd.,* and *Trident College* from Zambia have paved the way for numerous success stories along with various institutions like Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, etc! We are also connected with the likes of Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among many others to offer, build and extend the opportunity of the Edoofa Scholarship Program to more and more deserving students across Zambia.

23/11/23, 8:10 pm - +260 96 6555901: That is well noted
23/11/23, 8:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Glad to hear that, I will be taking you through all the aspects of the Edoofa Program but just before that, I would like to know you better as a parent. 

Kindly share a bit about yourself, what you do, what is your highest qualification, and what motivates you to support your daughter ahead for education. Additionally, you can add more about your family like the number of children, details of your spouse, etc.

Could you shed some light on what kind of student do you feel your daughter is, what are her strengths and weaknesses and how would you describe your child as a person, please?
23/11/23, 8:20 pm - +260 96 6555901: Alright. I am a medical doctor specialised in Obstetrics and Gynecology. Currently am Medical Director for my hospital. My greatest motivation to support Ritah or any child or person in furthering their education is to see them be independent and productive members of society. I have four children 3 biological. Ritah is the first. My wife is a teacher currently employed as a wardress for correctional services.
I believe Ritah has lots of potential education wise and can achieve more under the right educational circumstances. She's focused and probably multitalented too but needs a push most times. Generally a child am proud to be a father to but sometimes she's a little lazy
23/11/23, 8:40 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Your distinguished career as a medical doctor, specializing in Obstetrics and Gynecology, is truly commendable. Serving as the Medical Director of your hospital reflects your dedication to the field of healthcare. Your commitment to supporting your children in their educational pursuits, with the goal of fostering independence and productivity, showcases your altruistic spirit and vision for a positively impacted society, Mr. Alexander! Mrs. Loveness's commitment to education as a teacher and her role as a wardress for correctional services exemplifies her dedication to both the academic and public service sectors. Her dual responsibilities showcase her versatility and passion for making a positive impact on individuals' lives, whether in the classroom or within the correctional system!
23/11/23, 8:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I have confidence that Ritah is an exceptionally diligent student, and she will undoubtedly demonstrate her capabilities if given the right guidance! I believe that she will act as a beacon of resilience to her peers if she capitalizes on the appropriate opportunities!
23/11/23, 8:59 pm - +260 96 6555901: Thank you for your comments
23/11/23, 9:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly shed light on the educational background of Ritah's siblings, please?
23/11/23, 9:03 pm - +260 96 6555901: One is in grade 8. The second one in grade 4 and the last one is graduating from pre-grade school
23/11/23, 9:04 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Thank you for sharing, Mr. Alexander. So, could you kindly tell me how much *Tarcisia Floriana* charges you every term, and who in your family financially supports Ritah's education?
23/11/23, 9:08 pm - +260 96 6555901: My wife and I have been paying. Roughly k8000 per term
23/11/23, 9:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please brief me regarding the fees in USD?
23/11/23, 9:11 pm - +260 96 6555901: That's about 35USD per term. Or 105Usd per year <This message was edited>
23/11/23, 9:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since pursuing higher education is a significant undertaking that demands both mental and financial support, may I know who will be financially supporting Ritah's education abroad?
23/11/23, 9:16 pm - +260 96 6555901: You are right. It will have to be us the parents. Is there any form of cost relief through EDOOFA?
23/11/23, 9:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Alexander. The quantum of scholarship depends totally on a student's performance during various stages of the evaluation including tests and interviews.
23/11/23, 9:26 pm - +260 96 6555901: Oh okay. I see
23/11/23, 9:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Alexander and Mrs. Loveness. You are extraordinary parents, consistently providing unwavering support, guidance, and encouragement, and your dedication to your children's well-being is truly admirable!

23/11/23, 9:38 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! Well, before we move ahead with the course discussion, can you please share your motivation behind sending your daughter abroad for higher studies? Moreover, please share pictures of her previous qualifications results for evaluation. Also, please mention the year of completion of Grade 12?
23/11/23, 9:45 pm - +260 96 6555901: Wow! She just completed her grade 12 and probably marking hasn't even started. Just the confidential we have that she will do Well given how she has been performing. So no pictures to share yet. The drive to have her trained abroad arises from the general decline in quality and standards of higher education locally
23/11/23, 10:23 pm - +260 97 8703485: Just to add on what my husband has stated.The motivation of sending our daughter to study abroad is that., we thought that studying abroad plays a significant role in not only broadening her horizons  but also making sure that she'll be fully equipped for her future as possible.  It will also help to learn new approaches to handle different situations, manage time between studies & part time jobs if there are any.

24/11/23, 11:31 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I truly admire your vision, Mrs. Loveness, and Mr. Alexander! Exposure to foreign tertiary education offers numerous advantages. It broadens students' horizons by introducing them to diverse cultures and perspectives, improving language skills, and providing a global outlook. They gain access to world-class academic institutions, form international networks, and develop invaluable personal and professional skills. This experience fosters personal growth, enhances career prospects, and cultivates global citizenship. In essence, studying abroad is a transformative journey that equips students with the knowledge, skills, and perspective needed to thrive in our interconnected world!
24/11/23, 11:37 am - +260 96 6555901: Indeed Mr Shashwat.
24/11/23, 11:40 am - +260 96 6555901: On the other side, it does bring in anxieties and uncertainties of letting go of your child to a far foreign country. I believe both on the parent and the child.
24/11/23, 1:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand your concern, Mr. Alexander. *Edoofa* recognizes the inherent anxieties parents and students face when sending a child to study abroad.

01/12/23, 8:38 pm - +260 96 6555901: Day has been busy but alright
01/12/23, 8:40 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, if you had researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India, he/she has to crack the entrance exam, NEET, which selects only a limited number of students from a vast pool of applicants. NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test) is challenging due to its comprehensive syllabus, fierce competition, and the need to excel in Biology, Physics, and Chemistry, making it a demanding examination for aspiring medical students.
01/12/23, 9:05 pm - +260 96 6555901: Indeed.
01/12/23, 9:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Mr. Alexander. Since the Medical Industry is humongous, there are a plethora of courses that are extremely intrinsic for the Medical Industry to function! Shall I brief you regarding the courses?
01/12/23, 9:14 pm - +260 96 6555901: Sure please do
01/12/23, 9:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: The courses that she could pursue which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of Science in Physiotherapy*

8. *Bachelor of Science in Optometry*

9. *Bachelor of Science in Nursing*

10.  *Bachelor in Pharmacy*

After going through the entire list, may I know which course are you intrigued by so that I can brief you about the same? <This message was edited>
