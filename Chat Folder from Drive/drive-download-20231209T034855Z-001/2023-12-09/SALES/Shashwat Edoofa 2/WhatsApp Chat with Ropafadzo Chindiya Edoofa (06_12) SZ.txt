So basically answering your question, l have received quite a number of motivations including better education facilities, l hear being offered abroad. I have also been motivated by a lot of relatives and friends who have studied abroad and have been prosperous in their lives. As evidence from my own cousin sister Ngakudzeishe Chindiya who studied in the UK is somewhere in life and l admire that. I also received a church testimony from a lady from Church on Sunday testifying that her daughter lately received her degree, after studying in India for her program. This motivated me behind studying abroad and also earning a degree abroad. 

I completed my A level this year November 2023

Being able to stand up for what is right, for social justice is indeed a dream l aspire to. This is also a very important part of my aspirations as l would like to also get the opportunity to express my feminism through my career , as l have mentioned before. Not only do l wish to stand up for women but also want to stand up for Children's rights and aspire to deal with the family Law. Furthermore I don't only wish to be a lawyer but l aspire to lead the court room as further as a Magistrate. I aspire to motivate other women through my career so that gender equality is promoted so that women can also be able to achieve their goals besides their status. I basically believe that in the event of achieving my goals and career, l am going to motivate more women and young people to fulfill their goals and dreams. Not only do l do this for motivating other people but to enjoy what l love doing and to fulfill my dreams as l believe it is my calling.
