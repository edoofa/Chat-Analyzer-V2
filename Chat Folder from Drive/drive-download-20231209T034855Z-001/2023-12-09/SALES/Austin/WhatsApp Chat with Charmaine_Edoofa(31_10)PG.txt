03/11/23, 11:33 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Charmaine, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
03/11/23, 11:34 am - Pallika Edoofa: Based on my evaluation, considering your subjects, interests, and passion, you are eligible to pursue

03/11/23, 5:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Charmaine, Thank you for sharing this, I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students can achieve their career goals and have a prosperous career ahead of them.

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
03/11/23, 5:06 pm - +263 71 839 0433: No we're not aware
03/11/23, 5:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
03/11/23, 5:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/11/23, 5:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.



*So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?*
03/11/23, 5:08 pm - +263 71 839 0433: No it's not affordable
03/11/23, 5:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's understandable!!!

let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
03/11/23, 5:09 pm - +263 71 839 0433: No
03/11/23, 5:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. <This message was edited>

So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
03/11/23, 5:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

03/11/23, 5:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion.

Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-

Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
03/11/23, 5:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/11/23, 5:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
03/11/23, 5:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
03/11/23, 5:13 pm - +263 71 839 0433: Yes
03/11/23, 5:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
03/11/23, 5:15 pm - +263 71 839 0433: Okay thank you so much
03/11/23, 5:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Charmaine, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
03/11/23, 5:20 pm - +263 71 839 0433: 3
03/11/23, 5:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on *Earn While You Learn*

Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

03/11/23, 5:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
03/11/23, 5:24 pm - +263 71 839 0433: Mom and dad
03/11/23, 5:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
03/11/23, 5:33 pm - +263 71 839 0433: That's a great question. I imagine that my family would be both proud and supportive of my decision to study abroad. On one hand, they would be happy that I'm pursuing my education and expanding my horizons. However, they might also be concerned about the cost of studying abroad and whether or not I would be able to afford it. If I were to receive a scholarship, I think they would be grateful and relieved, knowing that I would have the opportunity to get a world-class education without the financial burden. I imagine they would be proud of me for my accomplishments and would continue to support me in my studies.
03/11/23, 5:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Charmaine, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
03/11/23, 5:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
03/11/23, 5:41 pm - +263 71 839 0433: Honestly I don't know all the formalities but am hoping you would help me
03/11/23, 5:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Charmaine, These are the main requirements.
03/11/23, 5:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, 
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
03/11/23, 5:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
03/11/23, 5:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/11/23, 5:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
03/11/23, 5:45 pm - +263 71 839 0433: Okay thank you
03/11/23, 5:46 pm - +263 71 839 0433: That's amazing
03/11/23, 5:46 pm - +263 71 839 0433: Yes
03/11/23, 5:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
03/11/23, 5:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
03/11/23, 5:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
03/11/23, 5:56 pm - +263 71 839 0433: Okay thanks
03/11/23, 5:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/11/23, 5:57 pm - +263 71 839 0433: Okay thank you so much
03/11/23, 5:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me know the stage, Charmaine.
03/11/23, 6:00 pm - +263 71 839 0433: Stage 1
03/11/23, 6:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's right!!!!!
03/11/23, 6:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
03/11/23, 6:02 pm - +263 71 839 0433: Yes
03/11/23, 6:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Charmaine, Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.



*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*



This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
03/11/23, 6:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
03/11/23, 6:03 pm - +263 71 839 0433: Yes I am
03/11/23, 6:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's great!!!
03/11/23, 6:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*
 
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
03/11/23, 6:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*
*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*

04/11/23, 3:19 pm - Austin: Greetings Mr Eddington,. Mrs Gloria and Charmaine,

*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*
Congratulations on clearing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program I hope you had a great session with Ms Pallika and learned about the program better. Now, I will be guiding you ahead to the Eligibility check stage after addressing your questions. 

Are you ready for the same?
05/11/23, 6:50 am - +263 71 839 0433: Yes
06/11/23, 4:09 pm - Austin: It is good to connect with you today, Charmaine

I hope you are doing well
06/11/23, 4:09 pm - Austin: May I know did you managed to discuss the Edoofa Program with your family, please?
06/11/23, 4:13 pm - +263 71 839 0433: Greetings
06/11/23, 4:15 pm - +263 71 839 0433: appreciate you checking in on that! I discussed the Edoofa Program with my family, and they had some questions and concerns about it. I explained the benefits and features of the program to them, and I think they're open to the idea. They just want to be sure that it's a safe and secure platform, and that it's not going to put their data at risk.
06/11/23, 4:17 pm - Austin: I am glad that you had this discussion with your parents
06/11/23, 4:18 pm - Austin: Being a parent, the concern regarding the welfare and personal development of their child is absolutely understandable. 

To give a glimpse, we have a community of more than 2500 Zimbabweans with  300+ associate schools from Zimbabwe with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, and parents, who have been bringing success stories of Edoofians for the past 14+ years due to the kind of foster and care that we provide throughout their course!

With UGC-approved Universities whose degrees are Globally accredited, and which have all security and healthcare facilities including counselling departments, Edoofians are exposed to a conducive environment that motivates them to focus on their career and achieve their dreams. There are Zimbabwean Communities at Every University so no child will feel lonely. Moreover, our Admission Team, EWYL(Earn While You Learn) mentor and counsellor of a student will be available to him/her throughout the course. At any point, if the student or parent needs assistance we will be readily accessible. This is the reason why Edoofa is known as a *Higher Education Concierge!*

The Universities are strict in terms of the welfare of children. Being in Zimbabwe itself, your parents will be able to track the happenings, academic performance, and University details
06/11/23, 4:18 pm - +263 71 839 0433: Okay thank you so much
06/11/23, 4:19 pm - +263 71 839 0433: Thank you so much for the information
06/11/23, 4:20 pm - Austin: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 4:20 pm - Austin: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 4:21 pm - +263 71 839 0433: Okay thank you so much
06/11/23, 4:23 pm - Austin: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 4:26 pm - +263 71 839 0433: That's so great to hear! The Earn While You Learn Mentors program sounds like an amazing resource for Edoofians. It's really great that Edoofa is going above and beyond to support its users in achieving their goals. I'm really impressed with this aspect of the platform!
06/11/23, 4:27 pm - Austin: Glad to hear that, Charmaine
Our commitment to helping our users achieve their goals is at the core of what we do, and we're constantly striving to offer valuable resources and guidance.
06/11/23, 4:28 pm - Austin: Is your parents or you having other questions for me please?
06/11/23, 4:30 pm - +263 71 839 0433: No but if you have something to tell me l would like to know
06/11/23, 4:32 pm - Austin: That is fine, 

So may I know the thoughts and opinions of your family regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
06/11/23, 4:42 pm - +263 71 839 0433: I appreciate your concern for my family's financial situation. I understand that the enrollment fees and cost of education are important factors to consider. I want to assure you that we're doing our best to find a solution that will work for us. We're not trying to be difficult, but we do have some financial limitations that we're working to overcome.
06/11/23, 4:43 pm - Austin: I do understand Charmaine, Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months this year and Let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
06/11/23, 4:43 pm - Austin: @263718390433 At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self-sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program. We also ensure them develop employability skills so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate. I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?
06/11/23, 4:45 pm - +263 71 839 0433: Yes I am
06/11/23, 4:45 pm - Austin: That is great to know!
06/11/23, 4:45 pm - Austin: So, before we move  to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While you Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
06/11/23, 4:47 pm - +263 71 839 0433: Okay thank you so much let me answer

3 On average, the cost of studies in India without a scholarship for international students varies from 6,000 to 80000 per year 

4 2 000 dollars to 3,000 dollars 

5 time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*

6 In short , the Earn While you Learn program is a unique opportunity that allows you to gain valuable work experience while earning an income to offset the cost of your studies. During your program, you'll have the chance to work in a professional setting, gaining valuable skills and knowledge while earning an income. This income can then be used to help cover the cost of your studies, making your education more affordable and accessible.


7 Yes , I understand that the registration fee is a part of my first year's annual fee after the scholarship has been applied. This fee is required to secure my spot in the program and to ensure that all the necessary arrangements are made for my arrival. I appreciate the transparency and clarity of the process, and I'm excited to move forward with my studies.

10/11/23, 8:09 pm - Austin: Good Evening Mrs Gloria!
I hope you are doing well
10/11/23, 8:10 pm - Austin: I do understand the challenges and let me please help you with your first concern on the authenticity of the program. It would be easy for you to verify as you are from Harare
10/11/23, 8:10 pm - Austin: Harare is very familiar to us as our founders hosted Education summits last year as well as this year. We are associated with many schools in Harare, some of them are the Nation's best schools, including *St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent High, Christ Ministries, Mablereigh Girls High, St Ignatius, St John's, Harare High, Advent Hope Academy etc*

10/11/23, 8:11 pm - Austin: @263784587307 , Inorder to help you with the financial concern, may I know which financial aspect of the program do you feel is challenging to you?
10/11/23, 8:14 pm - +263 78 458 7307: <Media omitted>
10/11/23, 8:15 pm - Austin: *Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library fees etc. It is paid in two equal instalments, each instalment before a semester. 
This cost can be further reduced by Charmaine through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program
10/11/23, 8:16 pm - Austin: Even though, the cost of education through the Edoofa Scholarship ranges from $2000-$3000 per annum, based on the child's performance in the eligibility check stage, she can be considered for a higher quantum of scholarship which can reduce the costs even below $2000 inclusive of tuition and living bringing down the costs lesser than that of Zimbabwe

10/11/23, 8:28 pm - Austin: If you understand the concept of International Education, the finances that play a major role is not visa fee or flight ticket because visa fee is given once in the whole program and the flight ticket is taken a limited number of times,maybe twice or once,because international students don't often travel back to their country.

They look forward to settling down and making sure education is not hampered.So they learn and do internships at breaks.But still students can definitely visit their family during holidays and spend time with them.

But I personally have seen that students don't travel often,so considering these the traveling fee
(air fare :-around $450,Visa fee:-$83) *is to be borne by the student* which is mostly a one time investment.
10/11/23, 8:29 pm - Austin: The cost of education is supposed to be paid in two equal installments, but usually students open an Indian bank account and parents make monthly deposits reducing the financial stress. Charmaine can pay the cost of education after arrival in India
10/11/23, 8:29 pm - Austin: You don't have to pay the full amount together
10/11/23, 8:35 pm - Austin: Every Edoofian will have access to the Earn While you Learn Program and Charmaine will also be guided for the same if she qualifies
10/11/23, 8:35 pm - +263 78 458 7307: Alright thank you.am also learning here,as it is my first time looking for a scholarship for my child
10/11/23, 8:35 pm - Austin: I do understand, did you manage to connect to any of our beneficiaries or their parents to learn their experiences through the Edoofa program?

23/11/23, 8:39 pm - +263 71 839 0433: Greetings sorry for late reply
23/11/23, 8:41 pm - Austin: Charmaine, did your family managed to research about the Edoofa Scholarship and understand the aspects?
23/11/23, 8:41 pm - +263 71 839 0433: Yes they did
23/11/23, 8:42 pm - Austin: So what is the feedback after the researches?
23/11/23, 8:44 pm - +263 71 839 0433: discussed the Edoofa Program with my family, and they had some questions and concerns about it. I explained the benefits and features of the program to them, and I think they're open to the idea. They just want to be sure that it's a safe and secure platform
23/11/23, 8:45 pm - Austin: I understand, have they connected and met our beneficiaries and parents in Zimbabwe to discuss about the security through the program M
23/11/23, 8:46 pm - +263 71 839 0433: No
23/11/23, 8:46 pm - Austin: May I know, what happened please
23/11/23, 8:46 pm - Austin: I see some of the contacts have been shared already
23/11/23, 8:49 pm - +263 71 839 0433: We only talked to Valerie so far and she has been so helpful
23/11/23, 8:51 pm - Austin: That's great to know!
23/11/23, 8:51 pm - Austin: Are you having any questions for me as of now?
23/11/23, 8:52 pm - +263 71 839 0433: Like what points do you expect from a student
23/11/23, 8:55 pm - Austin: I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
23/11/23, 8:56 pm - +263 71 839 0433: Okay thank you so much
23/11/23, 8:58 pm - Austin: You are most welcome!
23/11/23, 8:59 pm - +263 71 839 0433: Any information l must know or provide
23/11/23, 8:59 pm - Austin: Is your family comfortable with the enrollment fee and timeframe if you qualify?
23/11/23, 9:03 pm - +263 71 839 0433: Yes they are but they other factors like financial crisis
23/11/23, 9:04 pm - Austin: I understand, If we begin your eligibility check stage today, it would be of 1-2 days after which the results will be out which means, if you qualify the due date for the first part of enrollment fees($200) will fall towards the monthend. Is your family comfortable with this timeframe?
23/11/23, 9:06 pm - +263 71 839 0433: I will discuss this with them but am sure they will try
23/11/23, 9:07 pm - Austin: I understand, since today is the last day to consider your application, by what time will you be able to give me the feedback?
23/11/23, 9:08 pm - +263 71 839 0433: Exactly Tommorrow but when I told them about the scholarship and told they they is some money that will be required they sayed they will try to find the money
23/11/23, 9:11 pm - Austin: I understand Charmaine but it is very important to confirm with them if they are comfortable with the mentioned timeframe
23/11/23, 9:14 pm - +263 71 839 0433: Okay will give you feedback as soon as possible

08/12/23, 2:42 pm - +263 71 839 0433: I wanted to understand something in this statement it says 200 dollars before the 14th and the remaining by 13th

Am writing my final exams next year in November like l said before shouldn't my enrolment be in the following year 2025
08/12/23, 2:51 pm - Austin: There are two important reasons why the 2025 intake has been open now!

1) Zimbabwean students receive the results very late compared to other African Nations. The WAEC results of Ghana, Nigeria and other Western African Nations are declared mid-year. Malawians receive around the same time, Zambians receive the results much earlier compared to Zimbabwe, and students from other nations will be occupying the majority of the scholarship seats. This is the reason, we evaluate the O level and term results, interests and passion, career goals, extracurriculars, achievements, roles of responsibilities etc to evaluate the form 6 students for the Edoofa scholarship program. We also give the opportunity to parents to take part in the sessions on behalf of applicants so that deserving applicants do not miss the golden opportunity.
08/12/23, 2:51 pm - Austin: 2) The other major aspect is a *proper financial preparation as higher Education abroad is an important decision*
08/12/23, 2:51 pm - Austin: Early financial planning for tertiary education is crucial for parents for several reasons:

*Cost of Education:* Tertiary education, including college or university, can be expensive. Tuition fees, books, accommodation, and other associated costs can add up significantly. Planning allows parents to save and budget for these expenses, reducing the financial burden when the time comes.

*Time Horizon:* Tertiary education typically takes several years to complete. By starting to save early, parents have a longer time horizon to accumulate the necessary funds.

*Financial Stability:* By planning early, parents can avoid financial stress and debt. Without proper planning, they may have to rely on loans or other high-cost financing options, which can lead to long-term financial challenges. SAVE YOURSELF FROM LOANS

*INTERNSHIPS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK:* Early planning can also involve students participating in projects that will be offered by the EWYL Department of Edoofa after Induction which can help offset the cost of education. These opportunities often have application deadlines, so planning allows parents to take advantage of them.

*Teach Financial Responsibility:* Involving children in the financial planning process can teach them valuable lessons about money management, savings, and responsibility. It helps instill good financial habits from an early age.

*Avoiding Last-Minute Rush:* Delaying financial planning until the last minute can lead to rushed decisions and inadequate savings. Early planning provides a more thoughtful and organized approach.

*Goal Setting:* Setting specific financial goals for education allows parents to track their progress and adjust their savings strategies as needed. It provides a clear roadmap for achieving the desired educational outcomes.

*Peace of Mind:* Knowing that you have a financial plan in place for your child's education can provide peace of mind. It reduces uncertainty and allows parents to focus on other aspects of their child's development without constant worry about funding education.


In conclusion, early financial planning for tertiary education is essential for parents to ensure that they can provide their children with quality education without compromising their own financial stability. It allows for more effective financial management and better opportunities for both parents and students.
08/12/23, 3:20 pm - +263 71 839 0433: Okay thank you so much
08/12/23, 3:21 pm - Austin: You are most welcome, Charmaine!
