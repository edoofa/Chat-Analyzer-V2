I am expecting to hear from you
May I know if you are available for the session?
15/11/23, 12:13 pm - +263 78 099 8001: Hello
15/11/23, 12:14 pm - +263 78 099 8001: I am available now
15/11/23, 12:17 pm - Kunal: Good Afternoon
May I know why you were not responding?
15/11/23, 1:06 pm - +44 7440 425346: Morning...I am Tayana's sister and would like to inquire exactly how much we are expected to pay should she;
15/11/23, 1:07 pm - +44 7440 425346: get a full scholarship...are there costs that we incure?
15/11/23, 1:07 pm - +44 7440 425346: and if its a half scholarship how much are we expected to pay
15/11/23, 1:08 pm - +44 7440 425346: will she be able to work and go to school whilst in University or we will have to foot all bells of her stay there.
15/11/23, 1:15 pm - Kunal: It is good to hear from you
15/11/23, 1:16 pm - Kunal: Let me share an FAQ document with you and I want you to go through it and have a discussion regarding the same with your family
15/11/23, 1:17 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 1:23 pm - +44 7440 425346: I have just skimmed through this, to be honest we can barely pay $500 school fees for where Tayana is, let alone pay for visa application, plane tickets and other expenses for the duration of her stay in India. The cost is overwhelming as the current economic situation is unfavourable. Even if she finishes this degree she is not guaranteed of good paying job anywhere in the world because we know Zimbabwe is a non starter
15/11/23, 1:24 pm - +44 7440 425346: In a nutshell we cannot afford this scholarship
15/11/23, 1:27 pm - Kunal: I can understand
So, how is she going to proceed with her Higher education, please?
15/11/23, 1:32 pm - +44 7440 425346: We are really still trying to contemplate this as we are trying to resource funds for her to proceed with higher education
15/11/23, 1:36 pm - Kunal: Alright please
Let me help you understand
15/11/23, 1:42 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 1:44 pm - Kunal: As you can see these students who came to India this year and let me tell you that not all of them are from great backgrounds and they all had their hardships but they chose to make their future better 

And I also see that students are spending more than 2200 USD while studying in Zimbabwe, now through the Edoofa program the cost is much lower and there are specific courses such as BBA, Bcom and etc, where a child can even receive a higher quantum of scholarship. 
Apart from this, we have the Earn While You Learn program where students can self-finance and reduce the cost of education even more based on their efforts and efficiency
15/11/23, 1:45 pm - Kunal: Also our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months this year and Let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1200-$1500 per annum with nearly 20% or more hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe
18/11/23, 11:06 am - Kunal: Good morning, everyone
How are you doing?
18/11/23, 7:13 pm - Kunal: I wanted to inform you all that I will be unavailable for a few days due to a workshop
