For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
08/12/23, 1:27 pm - Kunal: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than *200 schools in Zimbabwe*. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with *St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others*. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few *St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa.

08/12/23, 1:27 pm - Kunal: *I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?*
08/12/23, 1:28 pm - +263 78 588 4481: Yess
08/12/23, 1:29 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
Before we proceed ahead shall we add your father again to the group? <This message was edited>
08/12/23, 1:29 pm - +263 78 588 4481: My mom is in the group
08/12/23, 1:29 pm - +263 78 588 4481: We can work with her
08/12/23, 1:43 pm - Kunal: May I know why do you not wish to add your father?
08/12/23, 1:55 pm - +263 78 588 4481: Its not like tht
08/12/23, 1:56 pm - +263 78 588 4481: As you can see he left the group
08/12/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 588 4481: But will tell him of wat we have discussed here
08/12/23, 2:03 pm - Kunal: As per the protocols of the program, the representation of your parents who will be supporting your education is necessary in the group so that they can follow the sessions and I can address their thoughts and queries directly. As you know higher education is a big decision that requires the support of your family. *So shall we add them again to the group?*

In case they are not available right now, they can still be the part of a group and catch up with the conversations later
08/12/23, 2:04 pm - +263 78 588 4481: Okay then
08/12/23, 2:04 pm - +263 78 588 4481: Do add my father
08/12/23, 2:05 pm - Kunal: I am making you the group admin, please add them
08/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 588 4481: Okay
08/12/23, 2:16 pm - Kunal: Let me know once you add them <This message was edited>
08/12/23, 4:46 pm - +263 78 588 4481: Okay
08/12/23, 5:42 pm - +263 78 588 4481: If possible can we resume with the session
08/12/23, 5:44 pm - +263 78 588 4481: At this moment my father is unavailable
08/12/23, 5:45 pm - Kunal: Well
I would suggest that you can still add your father because they can go through our conversations once available and it would help them understand the different aspects of the program. It would be easier to explain to them and to address their thoughts
Is that fine?
08/12/23, 5:45 pm - +263 78 588 4481: Okay then
