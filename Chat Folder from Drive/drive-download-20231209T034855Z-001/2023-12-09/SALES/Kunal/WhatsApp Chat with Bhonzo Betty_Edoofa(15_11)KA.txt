16/11/23, 5:57 pm - Kunal: Thank you for sharing
I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it

As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education  which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
18/11/23, 1:10 pm - +263 71 805 3492: am not
18/11/23, 1:13 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
18/11/23, 1:14 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
18/11/23, 1:14 pm - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
18/11/23, 1:23 pm - +263 71 805 3492: okay you the fees is paid once for the whole year or for one semester
18/11/23, 1:25 pm - Kunal: *This cost is paid in two equal installments.Each installment is paid before a semester.There are two semesters in a year*
18/11/23, 1:25 pm - +263 71 805 3492: okay understood
18/11/23, 1:26 pm - Kunal: Let me help you understand more

*Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash.

18/11/23, 1:26 pm - Kunal: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
18/11/23, 1:49 pm - Kunal: Shall we proceed?
18/11/23, 7:21 pm - Kunal: ,Greetings to you all
I wanted to inform you all that I will be unavailable for a few days due to a workshop

During my absence *Mr. Austin, Senior career counselor* will be taking your application forward 
Please note that your next session is scheduled at *12:00 pm CAT Monday (20/11/23) to resume your session *(In case you have any challenges, please let me know the time you will be available, and we will schedule accordingly)*

Stay Blessed!
18/11/23, 9:27 pm - +263 71 805 3492: yes l think so..l think while you work while learning after completing the course it can be easy to get employment because of the past expirience
18/11/23, 9:32 pm - +263 71 805 3492: okay
20/11/23, 12:08 pm - Austin: Good Afternoon to you all!
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*

I will be guiding you further through the Edoofa Scholarship Program and aspects. Are you ready?
20/11/23, 12:37 pm - +263 71 805 3492: good afternoon am ready
20/11/23, 1:05 pm - Austin: Good to hear from you, Betty!
20/11/23, 1:05 pm - Austin: Indeed
If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
20/11/23, 1:06 pm - Austin: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 1:11 pm - +263 71 805 3492: okay
20/11/23, 1:12 pm - +263 71 805 3492: yes understand
20/11/23, 1:18 pm - Austin: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.
20/11/23, 1:23 pm - +263 71 805 3492: understood
20/11/23, 1:35 pm - Austin: So after going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4 you like the most.
20/11/23, 1:39 pm - +263 71 805 3492: 3
20/11/23, 1:44 pm - Austin: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and employability.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

20/11/23, 1:46 pm - +263 71 805 3492: yes because l want to help my parents to finance my higher education
20/11/23, 1:47 pm - Austin: I can understand, There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
However, may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
20/11/23, 1:48 pm - +263 71 805 3492: my father
20/11/23, 1:50 pm - +263 71 805 3492: l have seen the certificates and l want to be a worker like Persistance to earn better
20/11/23, 1:54 pm - Austin: That's completely understandable,
So I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
20/11/23, 1:56 pm - +263 71 805 3492: that's everyones' wish and they will be proud if l to study abroad
20/11/23, 2:00 pm - Austin: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
20/11/23, 2:02 pm - +263 71 805 3492: yea
20/11/23, 2:02 pm - +263 71 805 3492: yes
20/11/23, 2:03 pm - Austin: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
20/11/23, 2:09 pm - +263 71 805 3492: a passport
a statement of agreement from parents
20/11/23, 2:13 pm - +263 71 805 3492: that's it
20/11/23, 2:15 pm - Austin: Indeed, Betty!
20/11/23, 2:16 pm - Austin: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
20/11/23, 2:16 pm - Austin: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
20/11/23, 2:18 pm - Austin: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 2:21 pm - +263 71 805 3492: Okay
20/11/23, 2:24 pm - Austin: This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
20/11/23, 2:24 pm - Austin: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
20/11/23, 2:24 pm - Austin: *Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
20/11/23, 2:41 pm - +263 71 805 3492: helpful
20/11/23, 2:41 pm - +263 71 805 3492: okay well understood
20/11/23, 2:42 pm - +263 71 805 3492: how can someone attend the Earn While you learn program classes
20/11/23, 2:43 pm - Austin: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 2:43 pm - Austin: Basically, the Earn While You Learn program offers Edoofians the opportunity to Earn Scholarship Credits by doing online projects on different platforms. Our students will be given online projects related to Researching, Content writing, Managing and Leading People, Community Building, Digital Marketing and many more. Based on their performance students can Earn Scholarship credits and reduce their fees. This fee will not be physical cash rather it would be reduced from the cost of education directly

All these projects are performed on online platforms and our EWYL mentors will be guiding them. The working hours are flexible and students can invest their free time.
20/11/23, 2:45 pm - +263 71 805 3492: Okay understood
20/11/23, 2:47 pm - +263 71 805 3492: 2
20/11/23, 2:49 pm - Austin: Well Betty,
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1:Connect with a counsellor- As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
20/11/23, 3:20 pm - +263 71 805 3492: yes
20/11/23, 4:30 pm - Austin: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
20/11/23, 4:30 pm - Austin: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025). <This message was edited>
20/11/23, 4:30 pm - Austin: Step 6: Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
20/11/23, 5:38 pm - +263 71 805 3492: okay
20/11/23, 5:38 pm - +263 71 805 3492: yes am
20/11/23, 9:53 pm - Austin: Betty, we have come to the end of your counselling session, now before I guide you for Step 2 which is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
