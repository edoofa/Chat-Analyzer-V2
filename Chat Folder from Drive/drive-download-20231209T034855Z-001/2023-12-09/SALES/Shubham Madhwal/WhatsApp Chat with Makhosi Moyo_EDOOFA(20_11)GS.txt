20/11/23, 3:26 pm - +263 78 657 3409: Thank you.... nice to meet you Mr Singh...
20/11/23, 3:26 pm - +263 78 657 3409: I think we can start the process as soon as possible
20/11/23, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Makhosi, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Tatenda, is that correct?
20/11/23, 3:29 pm - +263 78 657 3409: Yahhh it's true
20/11/23, 3:31 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Tatenda, also do tell me whether you learnt about Tatenda’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
20/11/23, 4:27 pm - +263 78 657 3409: Okay he just introduced me to edoofa... and told me that edoofa is a scholarship program targeting africa students  with a vision of making higher learning to be affordable even to underprivileged students
20/11/23, 4:29 pm - Gurvinder: Yes that is absolutely correct.
20/11/23, 4:29 pm - Gurvinder: Now let me give you a brief about the program.
20/11/23, 4:29 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
20/11/23, 4:29 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
20/11/23, 4:30 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
20/11/23, 4:31 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
20/11/23, 4:41 pm - Gurvinder: Well Makhosi, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care and do read the brief and address my question.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
20/11/23, 5:46 pm - +263 78 657 3409: Enen, one of my friends, is an edoofian.... I have heard so many great things about the program...
20/11/23, 5:55 pm - +263 78 657 3409: Yah um definitely looking for something like edoofa... as for me coming from a middle-class family... It's been  three years since I passed my advanced level, and due to financial reasons, I have been  failing to upgrade my education up to tertiary standard. I only managed to acquire a  diploma in mineral processing and extractive metallurgy..... which still needs the support of a degree.... so this is actually a great opportunity for me..
20/11/23, 5:56 pm - +263 78 657 3409: Okay no problem we will definitely communicate....
May God bless you too..
21/11/23, 9:32 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone!
I hope this message finds you all in the best of your spirits.
21/11/23, 9:32 am - Gurvinder: So are you available for the session?
21/11/23, 1:48 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Makhosi, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
21/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 657 3409: Good day......sorry for late response I had a very busy day..... my main concern is on scholarship application and I want to know more about the procedure....
21/11/23, 3:03 pm - +263 78 657 3409: I also want to do it ASAP....
21/11/23, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: Yes Makhosi be patient, this a counselling session so just move ahead with me.
21/11/23, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Makhosi, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
21/11/23, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
21/11/23, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
21/11/23, 3:08 pm - +263 78 657 3409: Yes
21/11/23, 3:10 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so Makhosi, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
21/11/23, 3:51 pm - +263 78 657 3409: Okay, thank you  for giving me this opportunity to  introduce myself... my full name is Makhosi Moyo.... um currently 23 years old. I attended my primary school in an underdeveloped school where I stood out as a hardworking, disciplined, dedicated, and single-minded learner with big ambitions in spite  of the status of the school. I passed my grade seven national exams with flying colors. In spite  of my economically underprivileged background because I  grew up as an orphan, my primary school teacher saw  it infact befitting that I should proceed to secondary school  under her financial support, thus how I got admitted to one of the best schools in Zimbabwe MZINGWANE HIGH SCHOOL. During my secondary school years, I stood out as a meticulous learner with strong senses of purpose, it is infact  befitting and deserved that I attained second of the best O' Level results in th ZIMSEC public examinations for 2018 6Bs and 2Cs. Under the help of a German guy (well wisher) who was willing to offer me financial support , I proceeded to A level where I attained 10 points... Biology was actually my favorite subject, and my wish is to do any course that includes biology.
21/11/23, 3:54 pm - Gurvinder: And may I know, who is going to support you for higher education?
21/11/23, 3:57 pm - +263 78 657 3409: My uncle who is currently in Canada...
21/11/23, 3:58 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.

22/11/23, 1:35 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Makhosi, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
22/11/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 657 3409: I believe that perseverance and determination always pay off..... with hard work, you get befitting results... so um, 200% sure about that..

22/11/23, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
22/11/23, 2:44 pm - +263 78 657 3409: One of the ultimate reasons why I want to study abroad is to gain life experience. I believe that I will learn how to organize my life and condense it into one suitcase, handle unforeseen situations, and be independent and self-sufficient.  People  usually say that when you're thousands of miles away from home, spontaneity and adventure are your best friends.
22/11/23, 2:45 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
22/11/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 657 3409: Well! I believe that education is fundamental to the development and growth of any country. We learn in order  to bring change in our country, in our communities, so studying abroad will inspire other children in my country to Value education and have a strong zeal towards education.....
22/11/23, 3:00 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community NAME, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you.
22/11/23, 3:00 pm - Gurvinder: Don’t you agree?
22/11/23, 3:04 pm - +263 78 657 3409: I personally agree with you on that point.... you have to be a role model. You need to have what it takes to inspire someone...
22/11/23, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: Yes that is correct Makhosi.
22/11/23, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
22/11/23, 3:08 pm - +263 78 657 3409: I have been wondering... and you can clarify on that point.... you have given me the opportunity to ask that question....
22/11/23, 3:08 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

22/11/23, 4:10 pm - Gurvinder: Yes that is totally fine.
22/11/23, 4:14 pm - Gurvinder: Please address this.
22/11/23, 4:15 pm - +263 78 657 3409: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 4:18 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, It is good to know that you are cured now, and let me tell you that if any such situation arises, you will always have our assistance.
22/11/23, 4:21 pm - +263 78 657 3409: Thank you.... it's good to hear that... because I have been worried that what if the same problem arise....
22/11/23, 4:22 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
22/11/23, 4:24 pm - +263 78 657 3409: Yahh we heard that the average can be $2000 per year...

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
22/11/23, 4:25 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
22/11/23, 4:25 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 4:26 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
22/11/23, 4:30 pm - +263 78 657 3409: Okay so edoofa is giving.... people greater opportunities....
22/11/23, 4:34 pm - Gurvinder: Yes that is correct.
22/11/23, 4:35 pm - Gurvinder: In simple words Makhosi what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
22/11/23, 4:38 pm - +263 78 657 3409: Well understood.... this is a good program indeed...
22/11/23, 4:38 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
22/11/23, 4:39 pm - +263 78 657 3409: Yahhh I want to know more about the program...
22/11/23, 4:42 pm - Gurvinder: Makhosi, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
22/11/23, 4:42 pm - Gurvinder: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
22/11/23, 4:42 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
22/11/23, 4:42 pm - Gurvinder: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
22/11/23, 4:56 pm - +263 78 657 3409: Okay okay.... now it's clear....
22/11/23, 4:57 pm - Gurvinder: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
22/11/23, 4:57 pm - Gurvinder: *1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion.

22/11/23, 5:06 pm - Gurvinder: Well Makhosi, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care, address my question, and do watch the video I am sharing below.
https://youtu.be/R83JhMfNZfw

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
22/11/23, 5:08 pm - +263 78 657 3409: Thank you... stay blessed too
23/11/23, 8:20 am - Gurvinder: Greetings Everyone,

*"With a dream, comes the potential for achievement."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
23/11/23, 8:34 am - +263 78 657 3409: Yes we are in
23/11/23, 9:05 am - +263 78 657 3409: Good morning.... I Mr Singh... I watched the video above... and I still want to understand more about EWYL program.... when did it start? Just after the commencement of the program or second year going forward?
23/11/23, 9:21 am - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Makhosi, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.
23/11/23, 9:21 am - Gurvinder: _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
23/11/23, 10:04 am - +263 78 657 3409: Yahhh now I get it.. and it reduces the entire cost of my higher education...
23/11/23, 10:05 am - Gurvinder: Makhosi, by now, I hope you have understood that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is not merely a platform for students to gain admission to an internationally recognized university. It offers much more. Among various differentiators, the value provided by Edoofa to a particular student surpasses that offered by any admission agent or consultant.
23/11/23, 10:08 am - +263 78 657 3409: Surpasses those agencies by far... and it's a great opportunity t0 us....
23/11/23, 10:14 am - +263 78 657 3409: I wish I knew it long time...
23/11/23, 11:24 am - +263 78 657 3409: So Mr Singh.... provided that um eligible for this program.... will you also assist during visa application....
23/11/23, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: Yes Makhosi, you will be assisted in that.
23/11/23, 12:36 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Makhosi, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
23/11/23, 1:49 pm - +263 78 657 3409: Yes, there are the ones
23/11/23, 1:53 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
23/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 657 3409: I have discussed this with my mom, and she was very okay with it . She also approached my uncle, one of my father's siblings who is in canada, and he's was promising to lend a hand.... so what we have discussed so far is positive...
23/11/23, 2:08 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
23/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 78 657 3409: Yes um ready now
23/11/23, 2:37 pm - Gurvinder: Makhosi, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
23/11/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 657 3409: So it's around 1500USD
23/11/23, 2:48 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Makhosi, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
23/11/23, 2:48 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 2:51 pm - +263 78 657 3409: Okay, I get it.
23/11/23, 2:52 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students.
23/11/23, 2:52 pm - Gurvinder: Don’t you think so?
23/11/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 657 3409: Yahhhh is revolutionizing the admission process...
23/11/23, 3:00 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
23/11/23, 3:01 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
23/11/23, 3:01 pm - Gurvinder: However Makhosi, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
23/11/23, 3:05 pm - +263 78 657 3409: Yah now I understand why most people are admiring this edoofa program.... yahhh it's better that way..
23/11/23, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
23/11/23, 3:07 pm - +263 78 657 3409: No, I have never heard of it ..
23/11/23, 3:08 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 3:08 pm - Gurvinder: Alright NAME, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.
23/11/23, 3:08 pm - Gurvinder: Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
23/11/23, 3:08 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
23/11/23, 3:11 pm - +263 78 657 3409: Yahhhh it's very clear 👌
23/11/23, 3:12 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
23/11/23, 3:12 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
23/11/23, 3:12 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
23/11/23, 3:12 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
23/11/23, 3:14 pm - +263 78 657 3409: Everything is very clear
23/11/23, 3:14 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
23/11/23, 3:14 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent.

Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

I think it is safe to say the trauma of a genocide stays with the affected population for a long, long time, and I also agree  that 16 years after the genocide, the Rwandan society and Rwanda have changed so much. In Today’s Rwanda, there is no room for segregation and divisionism. There is absolutely zero tolerance with regards to genocide ideology, Rwanda has achieved more than many people envisioned in the past 16 years From having the cleanest capital city in Africa, to being one of the least corrupted countries in Africa, being one of the most well-organized government in Africa, a champion of gender equality and a paradise for women, and many more.Rwanda has gone from being a “ failed state” to what many have called an “ economic miracle”.It has not been a smooth ride, but despite the challenges, Rwanda has continued to push through, overcoming danger and adversity along the way. 16 years after genocide, Rwanda is a peaceful, developing country, with the ambition to change the course of its history for the better. According to the World Economic Forum, Rwanda is among the top 20 safest nations in the world.The key reason for Rwandan success ( after 1994 genocide) is attributed to promoting gender equality. Giving men and women equal opportunity to acquire skills and knowledge. Women have not only embraced the opportunities, they have taken it to another level in all sectors of the economy in both private and public sector.Rwandans are the most dedicated and most resilient people. They love their country, and they are determined to work hard together to build a peaceful and prosperous economy.Rwanda has made significant progress in recent years in areas such as education, healthcare, and technology, which can provide opportunities for foreign professionals and entrepreneurs. Rwanda has made significant progress in stabilizing and rehabilitating its economy.

"My Inspirational story"

piration: Higher Education and South Western Community
This is my first time posting my essay on here but i need help please. I have never written a narrative essay so i need to know if this is what it is supposed to look like?

My Inspiration

My father taught me lots of lessons in life since I was young, but the one that stood above them all was the subject of education. He always told me that if I wanted to be successful, I would have to go to university and make something out of myself. My family is not a wealthy family. Therefore, my dad saved every single penny he earned from work to buy anything that I needed. He always encouraged me, because he knew that the value of an education will determine a future for me. As a result, I admired him. My dad had a huge impact on how I am today. He has influenced my life by teaching me lessons and showing me the rights and wrongs.
My dad taught me the most important lesson: how to be an independent male. I still remember the day that my father sat next to me and said, "Hey buddy", the most important thing to help you become successful is to have an education, it won’t be a walk in the park dude, but in the end it will be more then worth it. Of course, I already knew he was going to say that, for it was nothing new.

My father was a very smart man. He did not finish high school for he had my brother and had to drop out to work. He then had my sister and eight years later my mother and my father had me! My sister only accomplished one year of  high as for my brother, the straight A student, finished with our dad’s support and became an electrician. My dad always reminded me of how my sister and my brother’s life style were different. He thought (and might be right) that they have different life styles because my brother had a higher education was now satisfied and happy; unlike my sister whom wasn't ’t as happy and satisfied with her. 
The reflected appraisal that he made clear to me before he passed away, almost 7 years ago, was that I needed to further my education and finally do something with my life. he always told me that I was a lot smarter than I let people see. My father didn't let an opportunity pass to teach his children. My dad has taught me lots of things there is to know about many different subjects. Because of him I have learned to change tires on a car, because of him I have learned how to respect my siblings, because of him I have learned to cherish the moments in everyday life, because of him I have learned to have more confidence in myself. He was really a role model. Rest easy, man.
