*2) What is your understanding of the program as per your discussions with Precious?*
08/12/23, 4:51 pm - +263 78 016 6548: Firstly l would like to say that l was motivated to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship by my other school mates who had the scholarship and did the program l wanted so l wanted to do my degree out of the country because in Zimbabwe my degree is less likely to be approved thus was motivated by the advertisements of Edoofa
08/12/23, 4:53 pm - +263 78 016 6548: My understanding of the program as per my discussions with Precious  is that the program l want to do which is International Law is more likely to be successful if l get the scholarship and it may last 4-5years
