This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

15/11/23, 3:31 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Wilbert, now that we have finished with our training on the $300 plan, you act as a student ambassador for the Edoofa student community. With this empowerment and power, I want to notify you that as a part of your acknowledgment, the Department of Student Welfare will share an undertaking with you that you have to sign denoting that you have understood it.

And post your signature on the understanding that will happen in the coming days, you will be given the certificate stating that you are our *Edoofa Certified Student Leader*🏆
15/11/23, 3:33 pm - +263 77 720 7388: Ok mam
15/11/23, 3:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So Wilbert, yesterday you were not present in the session completely. May I know why?

15/11/23, 4:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

25/11/23, 6:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello my Proud Edoofian, 

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,
Ms. Saloni

27/11/23, 8:17 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Wilbert!
How are you?

Exciting news – the eagerly awaited discussion on the *Grant 2023* guidelines to discuss your performance and eligibility, is finally here! *Today*, we invite you and your parents to join the session from *06:00 - 07:00 PM Indian Time or 02:30 - 03:30 PM CAT.* Your presence will be precious 🤝
27/11/23, 2:33 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May we begin with our session?
27/11/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 720 7388: Hello mam
27/11/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 720 7388: Yes
27/11/23, 2:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am so excited to finally bring out the much-awaited opportunity that you have been waiting for! This is a wonderful time for me as a mentor as a lot of my students are in the process of making use of the Edoofa Grant that was allocated before the start of this academic year and I am sure that you would be curious too.
27/11/23, 2:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge (or the moment when the Grant was allocated to you by the founders of Edoofa - Mr. Angad & Mr. Avreen Singh); that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $200 annually. 

Do you remember this?
27/11/23, 2:41 pm - +263 77 720 7388: Yes I remember
27/11/23, 2:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Excellent Wilbert, on the same lines, do you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? I hope you recall that to make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy a few guidelines that were stated obediently and thoroughly. 
Can you recall what they were?
27/11/23, 2:43 pm - +263 77 720 7388: I cant remember man its been a while
27/11/23, 2:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Don’t worry, let me help you out on this,
27/11/23, 2:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: 1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University only if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
27/11/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 720 7388: I now remember
27/11/23, 2:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Note: You can redeem either one of the two - Grant or Scholarship Credits, whichever is higher.
27/11/23, 2:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
27/11/23, 2:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
27/11/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 720 7388: Ok understood mam
27/11/23, 2:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
27/11/23, 2:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
27/11/23, 2:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 3:03 pm - +263 77 720 7388: I attended 3 webinar of which know I was late one of the webinars
27/11/23, 3:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Attendance for the webinar is recorded based on the allocated time associated with the ID used for registration. We've established a specific time threshold; attendance is marked only if the student participates up to that designated time. This ensures accurate tracking and verification of attendance, promoting fairness and consistency in the process. If a student attends the webinar beyond this designated period, their attendance will be recorded.
27/11/23, 3:06 pm - +263 77 720 7388: Ok
27/11/23, 3:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Also, I can completely understand that you would have been occupied in University classes, assignments, and exams but let me highlight the story of of our student Nicassio Simbarashe, who was given the grant opportunity and without compromising any call, any day, he worked on the projects with his utmost attention, attended all the webinars and session with his mentor without fail. For him, it was not an added responsibility, but he considered Edoofa and the time given by his mentor crucial for his personal and professional growth. Making him one of our top earners and best performers.
27/11/23, 3:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: My aim is not to compare you with any other student but to help build a benchmark for you that we have a big scope of improvement and to showcase our best performance.
27/11/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 720 7388: Ok mam
27/11/23, 3:18 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
27/11/23, 3:18 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 3:23 pm - +263 77 720 7388: Ok
27/11/23, 3:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that, I believe, if you do perform, as per the above, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can surely confirm that you will surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. There is no limit to how much you can earn via the scholarship credits and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits. In our aim to do so, let us break the process into steps by first setting a desirable goal that you can achieve in this timeline. The primary requirement for us to achieve the goal of earning more than the Grant amount is your regular connection with me as a mentor and your dedication to working on the project. I hope that you are ready to take on this challenge with me.
27/11/23, 3:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would like you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.
27/11/23, 3:35 pm - +263 77 720 7388: Its mam I will do as required
27/11/23, 3:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: We will continue our discussion tomorrow from 06:00 - 07:00 PM, please make sure you come on time for the session.
27/11/23, 3:35 pm - +263 77 720 7388: Ok
28/11/23, 9:21 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon Wilbert,

I trust this message finds you well. I wanted to inform you that there has been a slight change in our schedule. Since I have a family event tomorrow, I need to reschedule our *EWYL Group session* for *Thursday from 07:00 PM to 07:45 PM*. I hope this adjustment is convenient for you. Your participation is highly valued, and I look forward to our session later. If you have any concerns or conflicts, please feel free to let me know🚀
28/11/23, 9:25 am - +263 77 720 7388: Ok mam thanks
28/11/23, 10:02 am - Saloni Edoofa: We will have our session on the *GRANT* that you received, where we will talk about your performance and eligibility *today* from *06:00 - 07:00 PM* in the *EWYL Group only*.
It is necessary that the parents are there in the sesion.
28/11/23, 11:11 am - +263 77 720 7388: Ok
28/11/23, 2:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May we begin with our session?
28/11/23, 2:41 pm - +263 77 720 7388: Yes mam
28/11/23, 2:43 pm - Saloni Edoofa: What I believe is very simple, you have to be consistent in all the calls and EWYL Group sessions, and in these sessions only I will be sharing ideas that can help you to level up your performance in the project exponentially. Another thing that you have to keep in mind is attending all the webinars without fail because they teach us skills beyond the four walls of the classroom and it directly caters to the idea of you becoming job-ready.
28/11/23, 2:44 pm - +263 77 720 7388: Ok mam
28/11/23, 2:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I have full faith in you and you to realize that this opportunity is not yet lost. We can do our level best and seize the opportunity to self-finance ourselves. Just remember one thing, consistency and dedication are definitely the keys to excel and I believe that you have the potential to do it.
28/11/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 720 7388: Yes mam
28/11/23, 2:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share now how have you planned your performance for every week?

28/11/23, 3:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Then how are you planning to do things then?
28/11/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 720 7388: I have to have a phone working  properly
28/11/23, 3:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May I know by what time will you phone start working well?
28/11/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 720 7388: I don't know because  I don't  have money to repair it
28/11/23, 3:26 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Have you talked to your parents about it?
28/11/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 720 7388: Yes they don't have money now
28/11/23, 3:30 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Then how do you believe you can connect with students?
28/11/23, 3:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: We will end the session today and will resume on Thursday since I won't be available tomorrow due to some personal commitments. I will let you know the time of the session tomorrow only.

30/11/23, 4:18 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So concluding the session with some awesome news!

In this opportunity you will be able to grasp live and practical knowledge of so many revolutionary things happening around us.🎉
But one thing that I want to share with you personally, something that really made me think hard is that since there will be a lot of students that we have to choose from for this one-in-a-lifetime opportunity and experience, will you be able to fall in that top student's category?
30/11/23, 4:18 pm - Saloni Edoofa: 🤔Do ponder upon it and honestly evaluate that should you be eligible for it,  have you been consistent throughout?
30/11/23, 4:28 pm - +263 77 720 7388: Ok mam understood
02/12/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello, my Proud Edoofian!

I hope this message finds you well. As part of our ongoing commitment to your personal and academic growth, we have scheduled a special activity for this Saturday that involves reflecting on your EWYL (Explore, Wonder, Yearn, Learn) projects.

During this activity, we kindly request each of you to make a small analysis of the input and output of the work you have done in your respective EWYL projects. This analysis should include insights into the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of your efforts. Feel free to share your successes and any unexpected discoveries you made along the way.

Additionally, we encourage you to think about ways in which you can improve upon your results in future projects. This is an excellent opportunity to set goals for personal and academic development.

Remember, growth is a continuous process, and each project offers a valuable opportunity for improvement. We look forward to hearing about your experiences and aspirations.

08/12/23, 4:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Well, since you have now seen your performance table, I would appreciate it if you answer the following questions so that we can discuss our plan of action for December accordingly:

1. I believe that if you perform well, you can definitely become eligible for the grant, but I want to know the points where you believe you are left behind and still are not eligible for the grant?
2. What do you think are the areas you would have to work harder to cross that line and get you to be eligible for the grant?
3. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?
08/12/23, 4:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would request you to share your thoughts on the same before 9 PM today so that we can discuss accordingly🚀
