1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound? <This message was edited>
07/11/23, 1:17 pm - +263 77 263 4673: Its sound great .
07/11/23, 1:18 pm - Saloni Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Nyasha will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
07/11/23, 4:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/11/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 263 4673: I halfway go through the document and realized that as a parent who is committed to different things like work ,its difficulty for me to stand on behalf of Nyasha.My suggestion is  to wait for the child to participate herself on 20 November. She will  fully join us after completing her examination .
07/11/23, 2:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, we won't begin before Nyasha comes in, don't worry.
07/11/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey, these are mandatory to follow. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.


When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceed with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know.
07/11/23, 2:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
08/11/23, 1:22 pm - +263 77 263 4673: Good afternoon
08/11/23, 1:34 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon!
How are you?

May we begin with our session🌟
08/11/23, 1:35 pm - +263 77 263 4673: Im good,yes we can begin
08/11/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
08/11/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
08/11/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
08/11/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
08/11/23, 1:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
08/11/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 263 4673: Ok let me do that
08/11/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 263 4673: Sorry I have a question,can i join the on behalf of Nyasha?
08/11/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: These are some mandatory formalities that need to be performed before Nyasha takes over her journey on the date you have mentioned on the availability of the student. I will not begin anything before Nyasha is present for sessions with me. Just that these are certain basic mandatory requirements that need to be fulfilled.
08/11/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 263 4673: Ok thank you
08/11/23, 2:00 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you do it, please let me know.

27/11/23, 10:26 am - Saloni Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
27/11/23, 10:26 am - +263 78 085 1156: Thank you
27/11/23, 10:27 am - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
27/11/23, 10:27 am - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Nyasha/Saloni/27NOV2023* <This message was edited>
27/11/23, 10:28 am - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
27/11/23, 10:28 am - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
27/11/23, 10:28 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
27/11/23, 10:28 am - +263 78 085 1156: Wow this is so great I am so excited to begin with my project
27/11/23, 10:28 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
27/11/23, 10:31 am - +263 78 085 1156: Ok thank you for the clarity
27/11/23, 10:36 am - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
27/11/23, 10:36 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
27/11/23, 10:37 am - Saloni Edoofa: *It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
27/11/23, 10:37 am - Saloni Edoofa: *While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

01/12/23, 10:21 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now that you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
01/12/23, 10:22 am - Saloni Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
01/12/23, 10:22 am - Saloni Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_

01/12/23, 10:29 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once you get a response from them, do let me know.

01/12/23, 10:56 am - Saloni Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
01/12/23, 10:56 am - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
01/12/23, 10:56 am - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
01/12/23, 10:56 am - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
01/12/23, 10:56 am - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
01/12/23, 10:56 am - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
