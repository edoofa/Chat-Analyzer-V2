We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
18/08/23, 2:26 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
18/08/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 854 7550: Thank you , l have understood
18/08/23, 2:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Your sessions will be held from next week, Monday onwards from 01:30-02:30 PM.

23/08/23, 1:44 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

May we begin with our session🫱🏻‍🫲🏼

23/08/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you,
23/08/23, 1:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am so happy to hear that how you think a student and mentor should be to be able to maintain that balance.
23/08/23, 1:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
23/08/23, 1:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/08/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 854 7550: 1. I agree with Henry Ford that a service must be offered first before being given rewards . l say so because in life people expect to be given a reward for something they have not worked for and it is a misnomer , which is an unacceptable action.
2. Achievement of goals is easier with proper guidance which is a result of applying proper rules and principles of life . Rewards should come only after a service has been provided . Proper application of principles brings with it satisfaction and better results . lf one does his/her work well , the prize would be great .
23/08/23, 2:46 pm - +263 77 854 7550: Am sorry  l am having network issues
24/08/23, 1:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

25/08/23, 2:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Your response demonstrates a strong alignment with the principles of hard work, service, and the importance of earning rewards through effort and dedication. Your agreement with Henry Ford's perspective highlights your understanding of the value of providing a service before expecting rewards. Your emphasis on proper guidance, adherence to principles, and the satisfaction derived from good work ethic further solidifies your commitment to a well-rounded and principled approach to life. This perspective is not only commendable but also motivational for others. It encourages individuals to strive for excellence and understand that rewards are a byproduct of dedicated service and adherence to principles. Overall, your response showcases a commendable attitude and understanding of these important life principles.
25/08/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 854 7550: Thank you very much
25/08/23, 2:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:

31/08/23, 1:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: _Greetings of the day!_
How are you?

So, I would like to share a piece of happiness that I experienced and received from my family yesterday. As I informed you yesterday we were celebrating Raksha Bandhan, let me share a glimpse of how I celebrated at my side👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🫱🏻‍🫲🏼
31/08/23, 1:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/08/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 854 7550: I am fine how are you
31/08/23, 2:18 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing good, thank you.
31/08/23, 2:18 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am glad to see how you have answered this Praise, it is amazing and you have put all your emphasis on the first project so let me begin with that.
31/08/23, 2:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
31/08/23, 2:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/08/23, 3:18 pm - +263 77 854 7550: I have finished listening to the audio
31/08/23, 3:18 pm - +263 77 854 7550: Am sorry for the late reply my network is down this side
31/08/23, 3:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
31/08/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 854 7550: Thank you and have a nice day
01/09/23, 2:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Your sessions will be held from next week, Monday onwards from 01:30-02:30 PM.
No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.
Till then, have a great weekend🌺
01/09/23, 4:42 pm - +263 77 312 5117: Praise is going back to school this weekend until the 15 th of November when she finishes writing her final 'A' level examinations. She will be having access to her fone as cellphones are not allowed at school and this is going to make her unable to access your communication. You may advise us on how we can go about her programme, we really need her to progress with EWYL programme.
01/09/23, 4:42 pm - +263 77 312 5117: * she will not be having access to her cellphone*
04/09/23, 1:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How was your weekend?

This week we will have our sessions on Thursday and Friday since the entire EWYL Team will be visiting our partner Universities to see our students who have come to India.
Let me share a glimpse of my last visits with you💫

04/09/23, 1:26 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/09/23, 1:35 pm - +263 77 312 5117: Good day to you too. Praise has gone back to school. She is in boarding & has no access to her fone now until the 16th of  Nov 2023. You can appraise us on how we can assist during her absence
04/09/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 312 5117: Beautiful pictures indeed
04/09/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since I want you to have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your exams. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
04/09/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Deepali, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till ___ (date) because I am having my exams from __ to ___ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Saloni as soon as I get over with my exams.
(Attach your date sheet along with this.)
Send it to - deepali@edoofa.com, and saloni.edoofa@gmail.com, ewyl@edoofa.com


Once done, please let me know.
04/09/23, 2:05 pm - +263 77 312 5117: Will definitely do so by day end tomorrow after getting a copy of her exam timetable. Thank you once again
05/09/23, 5:01 pm - +263 77 312 5117: Good day, I have sent the emails on behalf of Praise, as communicated yesterday. I hope the document will reach you soon.
Regards
Memory
16/09/23, 10:15 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
16/09/23, 10:15 am - Saloni Edoofa: If you are not available as a student, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Wednesday* from *09:30 AM - 11:00 AM* every week⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.
16/09/23, 5:28 pm - +263 77 312 5117: Good day, Praise is already at school now. We can take up her position to ensure continuity of the programme until she finishes her exams
19/09/23, 12:20 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How did your weekend go?
This is just a reminder that our scheduled session will be happening on *Wednesday* from *09:30 AM - 11:00 AM*⏳ this week.
_Please make sure that either you or your parents are present in the session_🚨
19/09/23, 12:21 pm - +263 77 312 5117: Noted, thank you. Good day
19/09/23, 12:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That will be great!
20/09/23, 12:30 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I hope you're having a good day.

I sincerely apologize for not being able to conduct the session at the originally scheduled time due to unforeseen circumstances. Please rest _assured that there is no need to worry_. I will be conducting the session *today, 20 September 2023* from *02:30 to 03:30 PM*⏳ as planned. _It's essential that either the child or a parent is present during the session._

Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to our session later today.
20/09/23, 12:33 pm - +263 77 312 5117: Noted with thanks. I will take up  Praise's session as she is at school right now
20/09/23, 12:33 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Sure!
20/09/23, 2:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let's begin with our session @263773125117 @263773194371
20/09/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 312 5117: It's ok, we can start
20/09/23, 2:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Praise can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
20/09/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 312 5117: Yes, we are
20/09/23, 2:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.

When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceeding with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know.
20/09/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 312 5117: Praise is willing to continue with the programme but she is currently unavailable due to her school calendar. She is already at school for her final examinations until the 16th of November 2023 as earlier indicated. You can guide us as to what to do now until she finishes her exams
20/09/23, 2:53 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Sure!
20/09/23, 2:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now we are ready to begin a new journey!
20/09/23, 2:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please note a few things:
FIRST- Please choose your batch for your sessions. Either it has to be 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
or 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
20/09/23, 2:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days you will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
20/09/23, 2:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
20/09/23, 2:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
20/09/23, 2:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
20/09/23, 2:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

20/09/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 312 5117: Tuesday & Friday

20/09/23, 2:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you do this, do let me know.
16/10/23, 1:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I hope you are doing well.

It's been a while since we started our EWYL Journey, and I must say, I am thrilled to be on this journey with you, aiming to reach new heights together and provide you with valuable earning and learning opportunities🍂. My goal is to lead you toward achieving remarkable milestones and make this journey truly fulfilling for you. While we are currently in a phase before resuming our EWYL Projects and regular sessions, I want to ensure that both you and your parents stay engaged and excited by sharing weekly updates.
16/10/23, 1:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To begin, I would like to share our *weekly newsletter* with you. In this newsletter, Mr. Angad shares his experiences, thoughtful insights, and motivational quotes, and even highlights a student in our Hall of Fame. I encourage you to *read through it and let me know your thoughts and takeaways from the newsletter*. If, for any reason, you are unable to provide feedback, I kindly request that *your parents share their thoughts instead💭*

16/10/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 312 5117: I have learnt that goal setting is vital for all success to happen. Focus should not be on money but hard work, consistence and diligence. Once one has established clear goals and pursue them consistently, he/ she is bound to succeed in life. Sweet comes after sweat.
17/10/23, 8:16 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good day!

These stories exemplify the strong bond we've formed and the support we provide.
