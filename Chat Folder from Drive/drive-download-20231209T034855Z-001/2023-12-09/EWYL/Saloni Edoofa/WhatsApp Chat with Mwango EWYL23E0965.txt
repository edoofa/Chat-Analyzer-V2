04/12/23, 2:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would also wish for their school to be connected with Edoofa in order to strengthen the partnership and to make sure that the benefits and perks of being a part of this community get to others as well.

04/12/23, 2:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: No worries, do let them know to share their ideas on this!
04/12/23, 2:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So Mwango, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
04/12/23, 2:13 pm - +260 95 3411232: In the long run, my goal as a biochemistry student is to play a pivotal role in advancing scientific knowledge, particularly in the realm of healthcare. I aspire to contribute to groundbreaking research, with a focus on developing new drugs or therapies that can address prevalent health challenges. Beyond that, I see myself taking on leadership roles in research projects, collaborating with experts, and striving to make tangible contributions to the field.

Furthermore, my passion extends to the realm of education. I envision a future where I can share my acquired knowledge and experiences with aspiring individuals. Whether through teaching at the university level or engaging in research institutions, I aim to inspire and guide the next generation of scientists. Overall, my long-term goals revolve around making meaningful contributions to biochemistry, both in terms of scientific advancements and the mentorship of future professionals in the field.
04/12/23, 2:14 pm - +260 95 3411232: The Edoofa "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) program aligns with my long-term goals by providing a practical avenue to support my education financially. As I engage in the program, earning credits that can be applied toward my annual university fees, it significantly reduces the financial burden associated with my studies. This financial flexibility, facilitated by the EWYL program, allows me to focus more on my biochemistry studies and research aspirations.

Moreover, the program offers a unique opportunity to gain hands-on experience and practical skills, which can complement my academic knowledge. The exposure to real-world applications of biochemistry through the EWYL program could enhance my readiness to contribute meaningfully to scientific research and drug development in the long run. Overall, the financial support and experiential learning provided by EWYL create a supportive environment for me to pursue and achieve my ambitious goals in the field of biochemistry.
04/12/23, 2:26 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This is amazing, you have shared in-depth information about your goals really well, and I am super delighted to go through it!
04/12/23, 2:26 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
04/12/23, 2:27 pm - +260 95 3411232: No
04/12/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
04/12/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
04/12/23, 2:31 pm - +260 95 3411232: I understand
04/12/23, 2:32 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
04/12/23, 2:34 pm - +260 95 3411232: . I'll be there with the same zeal and enthusiasm at my given slot (01:30-02:30 PM) in the EWYL Group. Thank you for the reminder!

How are you?

May we begin with our session🌟
06/12/23, 1:34 pm - +260 95 3411232: I'm alright thank you and how are you?
06/12/23, 1:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you!
06/12/23, 1:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Thank you so much for this acknowledgement!
06/12/23, 1:39 pm - +260 95 3411232: I'm glad and excited for today's session
06/12/23, 1:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
06/12/23, 1:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *Sounds interesting, right?*
06/12/23, 1:52 pm - +260 95 3411232: Yes it does
06/12/23, 1:53 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
06/12/23, 1:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 1:54 pm - +260 95 3411232: Indeed it will . Let me read through it I'll tell you when I'm done

06/12/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
06/12/23, 2:12 pm - +260 95 3411232: Each section keep getting better and better
06/12/23, 2:12 pm - +260 95 3411232: I also love how he came out on the quotes <This message was edited>

06/12/23, 2:20 pm - Saloni Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
06/12/23, 2:20 pm - Saloni Edoofa: How does that sound, Mwango?
06/12/23, 2:22 pm - +260 95 3411232: Your three goals for the EWYL journey are clear and commendable. I'm on board

06/12/23, 2:29 pm - +260 95 3411232: Indeed
06/12/23, 2:31 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.

Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
07/12/23, 1:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 1:40 pm - +260 95 3411232: Yes it is
