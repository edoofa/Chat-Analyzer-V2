09/08/23, 12:41 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I understand your concern, Wasikananka. To address this issue, you might consider requesting assistance from your other family members to obtain a computerized birth certificate on your behalf. Once you have it, they can send you a scanned copy. If feasible, you could then have it printed, which could significantly streamline the process and save both time and effort.
09/08/23, 12:42 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Further, you can consult your admissions team regarding this and they will be able to guide you better on this.
09/08/23, 1:13 pm - +263 71 259 4208: I tried this yesterday but was told that the system is down nationwide,so l could not go further than this.
09/08/23, 1:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Ohh Okay. I understand your concern. Maybe you can wait for a day or say to get this done.

📍 Please ask your *parents to confirm in this group that you've discussed the $300 plan with them*.
📍 *Share a screenshot* of the *Google review* you write for Edoofa.
📍 *share a screenshot* of the *Facebook review* you write for Edoofa.

03/10/23, 8:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: _*Attention*_

It's quite disheartening to observe that you haven't managed to spare *enough time to share your Facebook and Google reviews* with me. I see only two conceivable explanations for this:

1. You don't deem this as important or *valuable.*
2. You're *postponing it*, intending to do it at your leisure.

If there is any other reason, I am happy to understand that. If neither of these reasons applies, I expect you to submit them by *12 PM tomorrow!*

18/10/23, 4:02 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now allow me to recap this project quickly for you in 2 steps:

STEP 1 - As a proud Edoofian and as a student who is going to go for international higher education, you will connect with various principals or headmasters on this project. You will introduce yourself, and share with them how you got the scholarship and what your future aspirations are.​
​​
STEP 2 - ​After that, you will share details about the program with the principals and ask them if you can schedule a call with the Edoofa program Director so that the students of their school can also achieve the same.
18/10/23, 4:02 pm - Sharda Edoofa: After the school authorities respond to your message and you set up our meeting with them, you can ask them to fill up the form that will be shared by me in a while. Once you get that information, you can send me the school details via this form.

18/10/23, 4:06 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Not only former school but any school that is not connected with Edoofa.
18/10/23, 4:06 pm - +91 73031 04460: Ouky understood
18/10/23, 4:06 pm - Sharda Edoofa: And #2  The *Scholarship Credits* earning opportunity for this project!

18/10/23, 4:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *If the School is not connected with Edoofa:*
18/10/23, 4:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
18/10/23, 4:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *If the School is connected with Edoofa:*
18/10/23, 4:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
18/10/23, 4:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?

I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this further with you. Could you please let me know when it would be convenient for you to connect via WhatsApp?
