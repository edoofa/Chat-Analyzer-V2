09/12/23, 12:35 am - +260 97 8133366: 1. Edoofa offers internships and industry oriented training that is enshrined into the university's curriculum... the program also provides an opportunity to earn scholarship credits through an EWYL program ... this reduces fees of higher education and gives us the students work experience making us more employable 

2. The Earn While You Learn program is a program designed to provide us the students with internship opportunities from influential organizations to work on projects part time and gain valuable skills all whilst still studying... this in turn provides scholarship credits that will help lower the cost of learning 

3. Firstly is the application stage... following this is when one gets in touch with career counselors through one on one sessions... after this... one is expected to pass the eligiblity check interview at by the edoofa program directors and academic board... once cleared one will receive an acceptance letter... after receiving the acceptance letter the student gets in touch with the admissions team and a statement of purpose is drawn out and University admission is finalized all while working with the EWYL mentors to earn credits... lastly is the preparation to travel which can be assisted by the admissions team

4. The testimonial I'll be writing about is from Prince Dhilawayo a Zimbabwean who's been in India for two months (as per the video)... he strongly appreciates the edoofa team for taking him thus far and also appreciates the country and it's education system
