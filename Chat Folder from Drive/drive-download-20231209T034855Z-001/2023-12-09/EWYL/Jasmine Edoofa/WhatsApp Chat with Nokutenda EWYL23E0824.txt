30/10/23, 8:42 pm - +263 77 709 4369: *Dear Mentor, my name is Mr Madziwa, and I am the father of Nokutenda. My son's EWYL group name is Nokutenda EWYL23E0824.

31/10/23, 4:12 pm - +263 78 078 0828: Umm can explain further on the objectives
31/10/23, 7:03 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Waiting for this message
01/11/23, 8:22 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good Morning Nokutenda and Parents_*
"Happy new month! May this month bring you new beginnings, new adventures, and new opportunities. Let's make it a month to remember."

*_This is to remind you that you have your session today from 8:30 am_* 
Are you ready?
01/11/23, 8:37 am - +263 77 292 6729: Thank you
Good morning Jasmine
01/11/23, 8:38 am - +263 77 292 6729: Ok ready
01/11/23, 8:43 am - Jasmine Edoofa: May I know were you able to go through this message?
01/11/23, 8:43 am - +263 77 292 6729: Yes and it made things clear
01/11/23, 8:45 am - Jasmine Edoofa: The second goal is to help all our edoofians self-finance their education, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
01/11/23, 9:13 am - +263 77 292 6729: Understood
01/11/23, 9:16 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the EWYL team. 
Ms.Sanjana is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.

Yes, Now she is not online, but she will definitely get back to you once she is online.
01/11/23, 9:21 am - +263 77 292 6729: Nice to be connected to you ma'am
01/11/23, 9:21 am - Jasmine Edoofa: We also have Ms. Davi, the Head coach with us, and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 

Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
01/11/23, 9:36 am - +263 77 292 6729: Ok welcome Ms Davi
01/11/23, 9:43 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates Nokutenda to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.e. The student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
01/11/23, 10:01 am - +263 77 292 6729: It's fine will make sure Nokutenda is available on the times he is needed
01/11/23, 10:25 am - Jasmine Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for Nokutenda’s  EWYL journey:

1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Nokutenda? <This message was edited>
01/11/23, 10:28 am - +263 77 292 6729: Excellent
01/11/23, 10:29 am - Jasmine Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work on three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. You can take today’s time and go through the document and answer these questions for me. 
Will that be okay?
01/11/23, 10:30 am - +263 77 292 6729: It's ok
01/11/23, 10:31 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 10:32 am - Jasmine Edoofa: So now we have completed our introduction of the Earn While You Learn Program.
Now there are two options. First of all, I would like to know if is Nokutenda available for the sessions that will be held twice a week? <This message was edited>
01/11/23, 10:32 am - +263 77 292 6729: Yes he will be available
01/11/23, 6:24 pm - +263 78 078 0828: Hie

03/11/23, 9:22 am - Jasmine Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say "I am a proud EDOOFIAN' on the EWYL line.
03/11/23, 9:22 am - Jasmine Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. It fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
03/11/23, 9:31 am - +263 77 292 6729: Great we are proud for sure
03/11/23, 9:32 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now may I know can I expect a message from Nokutenda by today?
03/11/23, 9:34 am - +263 77 292 6729: He will do that after exam
03/11/23, 9:36 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Then, As per our Academic Board terms, you are required to draft a mail on behalf of Nokutenda to me stating that:

Greetings of the day,

Hope this message finds you in high spirits! 🌟 As an Indian, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings🕯️

_*Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.*_

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨
