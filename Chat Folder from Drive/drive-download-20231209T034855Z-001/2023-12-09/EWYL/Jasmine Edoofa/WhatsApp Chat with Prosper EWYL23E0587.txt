My name is Jasmine, and you can refer to me as *Ms. Jasmine.* As your EWYL mentor, I am committed to helping you make the most of our journey together in the EWYL program.

I would like to schedule a session with you today i.e. 14-09-2023 from *1:30 pm to 02:30 pm*, during which we can have a productive discussion.
May I know if you are comfortable with the timings?
14/09/23, 9:11 pm - +263 78 346 6852: Hello Ms.Jasmine , I think we could change the Scheduling time because by 7:30 am to 5:00 pm I will be at school
15/09/23, 8:11 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, I can understand but since you have begun your Earn While You Learn Journey I would want to utilize the initial few days to let you know about the program's vision and mission. This will not take longer than 3 days. 

So, May I know that will you be able to come for the session from 8:30 am to 9:30 for the first three days?
15/09/23, 8:12 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Also, I would like you to know that we have a 3:30 hrs of time difference, and till the time it is 5:00 pm in Africa, it will be 8:30 pm here in India, which is very late for me.

I hope you are doing well. I wanted to reach out to you regarding an important matter related to Prosper, where I have been serving as a mentor for a very long time. Moreover, there have been instances where Prosper has missed several sessions. <This message was edited>
19/09/23, 10:46 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I truly believe in Prosper's potential, and I am committed to providing guidance and support. *However, I would like to kindly request your involvement and cooperation as well*. I believe that your input and encouragement would greatly benefit Prosper's progress and development. I expect acknowledgment and cooperation.
19/09/23, 7:01 pm - +263 78 346 6852: Hello , I'm sorry for missing some of the session , it was all due to poor electricity supply in my area , but I am available now

20/09/23, 1:30 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I hope you know that we have a 3:30-hour time difference. Till the time you texted it was 10:31 pm in India.
20/09/23, 8:37 pm - +263 78 346 6852: Hello by 1:30 pm I will be at school, so i can't attend a session on that time . Is there any problem if we could some changes on our session time

25/09/23, 12:19 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon. I can two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
25/09/23, 7:32 pm - +263 78 346 6852: Greetings 🤝 ,, I am comfortable with the idea of attending Saturday sessions because during the week , I will be busy , as we are about to go for our final examinations

10/10/23, 2:00 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Allow me to paint a picture of myself, not just in words, but in actions. Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program, I will be connected even when you are here in India. 

I am a seasoned professional with extensive experience in mentoring students, and I possess a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities that arise when studying overseas.
10/10/23, 2:00 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 479 5160: Thank you ma'am iam happy to hear that you will be my son's mentor throughout his journey in India
10/10/23, 2:11 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I hope you did get an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with you.
Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
10/10/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 479 5160: No can you please help
10/10/23, 2:14 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the first goal is to ensure that all Edoofians have an equal opportunity to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a systematic program/curriculum in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Prosper is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his professional goals.
10/10/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 479 5160: Yes I understand
10/10/23, 2:17 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the EWYL team. 
Ms.Sanjana is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
10/10/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 479 5160: Ok it's clear
10/10/23, 2:21 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: We also have Ms. Davi, the Head coach with us, and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 

Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
10/10/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 479 5160: That is great
10/10/23, 2:22 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates Prosper to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.e. The student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
10/10/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 479 5160: Ok Iam  clear
10/10/23, 2:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for Prosper’s  EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
10/10/23, 2:43 pm - +263 77 479 5160: Very welcome thank you so much
10/10/23, 2:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work on three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. You can take today’s time and go through the document and answer these questions for me. 
Will that be okay?
10/10/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 479 5160: Yes ma'am you may send it so that I will go though it
10/10/23, 3:03 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 3:03 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here are the questions
1. Name all three projects.
2. What do you understand from Project 1?
3. What do you understand from Project 2?
4. What do you understand from Project 3?
You can read the document and answer the questions before our session tomorrow. May I know if is it clear?
10/10/23, 3:08 pm - +263 77 479 5160: Yes it is clear
10/10/23, 3:15 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Prosper can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-

1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc., and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page.
10/10/23, 8:25 pm - +263 77 479 5160: Yes Iam unerstanding
11/10/23, 4:35 am - +263 78 346 6852: *Question 1*:: 1) Corporate Alliances
2) Community Buildings
3) African Schools Education
11/10/23, 4:35 am - +263 78 346 6852: I got to understand that *project 1* has something to do with creating some links between Edoofa and other Organizations in my are , therefore Edoofians must be capable of doing the following-:

Identify local Organizations/ Companies in their countries and regions secondly ,Identify the decision-makers who work in these Companies Moreso , Reaching out to these Individuals to share Edoofa’s vision, mission and
the work we do Furthermore ,  Arranging for a call/video call meeting between Edoofa and these
Organizations ,  Finally facilitating the signing of Contract
11/10/23, 4:35 am - +263 78 346 6852: *Project 2* has something to do with the creation of community and it also addresses one on how to go through the enrolling process as well as giving emphasis on payout fee
11/10/23, 4:36 am - +263 78 346 6852: *Project 3* is talking of linking up African Schools and Indian schools , interms of customs through the Edoofian support. In this case one will give a list of higher level schools in his/her area  hence give some relevant information about Edoofa to the students of that certain school
11/10/23, 1:31 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon,
I hope you are doing well. 

It is time for the session. Are you ready?
11/10/23, 1:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Well, Done Prosper,
It clearly shows that you have read the document in detail. 
Keep it Up!
11/10/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 479 5160: Good afternoon  I am ready to represent Prosper as he is still at school
11/10/23, 6:21 pm - +263 78 346 6852: Thank you

I trust you're doing well. I'd like to inform you that I understand that you have a lot on your plate with school, but I'd like to extend an invitation to the parents for a session where we will delve into the vision and mission of the EWYL PROGRAM. After this discussion, I'll officially suspend sessions so that the child can concentrate on the upcoming exams. 

I'm wondering if you agree with this plan and if you're available for the sessions today?
18/10/23, 10:52 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Morning @263783466852 @263774795160*

I would like to tell you that I understand your child is currently immersed in exam preparations, and I fully appreciate your concerns about avoiding distractions for *Prosper*.  I hope you recall our previous discussion where we intended to conduct an initial orientation session for parents. Unfortunately, due to time contraints, you were unable to follow that.
18/10/23, 10:52 am - Jasmine Edoofa: In light of the circumstances, I am eager to go the extra mile to ensure that *Prosper* remains on par with fellow students. *I'd like to propose scheduling a session with you on Saturday, running from 5:30 pm to 7:30 pm.*
