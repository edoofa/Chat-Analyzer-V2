I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but I assure you that we will cover all the necessary topics during our session today. Please submit your Understanding of the Lesson before the session. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to me.

Thank you for your understanding, and I'm looking forward to our session today.

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details. I would like to offer you the opportunity to have a focused discussion about the grant and its implications. Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 10:00am CAT AND 1:30PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

16/08/23, 12:53 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now let me start this session by telling you the importance of the Grant. So are you ready?
16/08/23, 12:54 pm - +263 71 924 2804: Yes
16/08/23, 12:55 pm - +91 78273 08969: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments

They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
16/08/23, 12:57 pm - +263 71 924 2804: I really appreciate the opportunity to be seen as a role model by other students
16/08/23, 12:57 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
16/08/23, 12:58 pm - +263 71 924 2804: Yes
16/08/23, 12:58 pm - +263 71 924 2804: It also motivates me to work even harder to earn more credits
16/08/23, 12:59 pm - +91 78273 08969: Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
16/08/23, 1:01 pm - +263 71 924 2804: I truly appreciate you and the whole EWYL team for acknowledging my efforts
16/08/23, 1:04 pm - +91 78273 08969: Also, I want to emphasise that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
16/08/23, 1:30 pm - +263 71 924 2804: Yes ma'am, thank you
16/08/23, 1:36 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now, I'm providing you with a comprehensive FAQ document that addresses all potential queries. It's advisable for both you and your parents to review it thoroughly. If any additional questions arise, please make a note of them so that we can address them in our future discussions.
16/08/23, 1:37 pm - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
16/08/23, 2:27 pm - +263 71 924 2804: Yes ma'am
16/08/23, 2:29 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now, I assume you've had the chance to review the Grant Letter. Now, I would really appreciate it if you proceed with signing the undertaking of the Grant Letter, which will serve as the formal acceptance of your grant.

Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride. It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.
16/08/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 292 4338: Hello Ma'am truly I'm filled with pride and joy for my child's success and achievement. I am so grateful to you the EWYL team  for giving my child the chance to go for the Grant Challenge  I forever remain grateful

16/08/23, 4:07 pm - +91 78273 08969: As we wrap up our discussion, I wish to celebrate your extraordinary achievement. Among so many dedicated and hardworking students, it was your unbeatable determination and added skills that set you apart and earned you this prestigious grant. This is not just a mere stroke of luck, but a testament to your relentless pursuit of excellence🚀

I wholeheartedly urge you to channel your efforts diligently every single day and unburden yourself from financial concerns by earning as many scholarship credits as possible.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Aditi your new mentor will contact you on Tuesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Aditi's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

I hope this message finds you well. As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We will now hold our mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.

21/10/23, 1:17 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here are the pointers for your help for your new task to creat a 1-2 min video of yourself.

You should share entirely about your journey, starting from the counseling stage till their arrival. You should share with the student that you paid your enrollment fee after getting eligible for the program and are informed about the cost of education in India before and after the Edoofa Scholarship which is far more affordable as compared to their home country.

) Student's journey so far with the program,
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) Highlighting the importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with your counselor and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Their initial feedback of how life is different in India how the basic amenities are cheaper as compared to your homeland (you may use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by themselves and struggling with the process. (you may refer to DSW's Help in explaining the normal process as compared to Edoofa's Process)
f) Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.
21/10/23, 1:21 pm - +263 71 924 2804: Okay ma'am ,sorry l had network issues before
21/10/23, 1:22 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I understand, Lisa!

01/11/23, 12:12 pm - +91 74284 45625: Greetings! I'm Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, EWYL, and I hope this message finds you and your parents in good health.

04/11/23, 11:04 am - +263 71 924 2804: The students l share with about Edoofa drop out after a few counseling sessions or face other challenges then drop out before coming to India so is there any alternative way for me to earn scholarship credits that involves me working individually not depending on other people like in this case l have to depend on students' willingness and seriousness to come to study here for me to earn scholarship credits
04/11/23, 11:05 am - +263 71 924 2804: Then how many credits are the to my name as of now if any
04/11/23, 12:35 pm - +263 71 924 2804: ...link?
04/11/23, 12:44 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, Lisa regarding this as you know Mr. Mukund is there every week, so you also might have noticed that he wasn't there last week as he himself wasn't well and as under the communications with the University we were under the impression until yesterday that she was back from the hospital. Yesterday we were in the orientation as you must be aware.
04/11/23, 1:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That is correct Lisa, currently your the application forms you submitted those students haven't enrolled yet, so you haven't earned much credits but don't worry try harder you will earn.

08/11/23, 3:32 pm - Aditi Edoofa: However, a lot of you struggle at performing these projects and in pursuit of your success, here I am sharing a few key points that will help you excel at your projects.
08/11/23, 3:33 pm - +263 71 924 2804: Waiting
08/11/23, 3:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: A big part of our journey as an Institution has been our community of students. I believe that we exist only because of our students. I am able to create opportunities because of our students and hence the Community Building Project is utterly crucial to us and our institution.
08/11/23, 3:37 pm - +263 71 924 2804: Noted
08/11/23, 3:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Today we’ll be focusing on training you to ace this project. As all of you are aware the rewards/credits for this project have been revised and increased to 300$, which calls for better performance, increased effort, and a better approach to the project. Let’s learn more!
08/11/23, 3:44 pm - +263 71 924 2804: Following
08/11/23, 3:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I have observed that honesty, transparency, and authentic conversations with people lead to the best results. Since you are here in India, and I am aware that a lot of you are grateful for it, the objective is to share that feeling with the things that you love in your new life. The sheer convenience of having a nonstop supply of electricity, and availability of internet that is almost as good as free- resources that were way more difficult to achieve back home, All of your brothers and sisters deserve those same opportunities.
08/11/23, 3:51 pm - +263 71 924 2804: That is true but nowadays Edoofa has become so well known that a person can just apply on their own from an online application form
08/11/23, 4:04 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So you should convince them, there must be somebody back there who must be convincing them.
Sharing a story, even if it’s your own, is an art. It builds confidence, creative expression, empathy, and perspective and improves presentation skills. With this project, we are going to train you on all of these skills and also help you by sharing what you can actually tell them when you talk to them. I will also empower you to select students who you want to be a part of the community which will be based on your criteria of whether they are ready for this opportunity. After your training, you will be involved deeply in shortlisting the applicants before they submit their applications.
08/11/23, 4:34 pm - +263 71 924 2804: Noted ma'am
08/11/23, 4:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So I am sharing this week's lesson with you.

Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Celebrate Diwali by lighting Diya's🪔, and capture the moment by snapping a photo of your lit and amazing celebration.🤩 Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.❤️

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

15/11/23, 6:28 pm - Aditi Edoofa: WEDNESDAY LESSON OF THE WEEK

Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

18/11/23, 1:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now your task is to answer these questions then I will share the answers of the same.I hope it's clear.
18/11/23, 1:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: 1) How to apply and fast-track your application process in the Edoofa Scholarship
Program?
2) Why did I choose the Edoofa Program over other agents and consultants?
3) Before you ask me what the Earn While You Learn Program (EWYL) is, let me explain
to you the uniqueness of the Edoofa Program.
4) Why INDIA is a dream destination for Education for Africans?
18/11/23, 1:54 pm - +263 71 924 2804: Okay maam
19/11/23, 1:47 pm - +263 71 924 2804: 1.The best way to fast track your application process in the Edoofa Scholarship Program is to avoid the online application rather get someone like a student who already enrolled with Edoofa and could be currently learning in India itself they have a first hand connection with the Edoofa people and can connect you directly there by fast tracking your application.

2.I chose Edoofa over other agencies and consultancy because for them it's not just about the money they actually care about our welfare as students , they do not leave us to fend for ourselves after arriving in India , they continue checking on us trying to be there every step of the way and being there to solve any problems if ever we encount them

3.What makes the Edoofa Scholarship Program more unique is probably the EWYL program.This is when small tasks or projects are allocated for us as students by our mentors .In doing these projects we  actually stand a chance to earn scholarship credits .And the good thing about this is they are not limited but you can earn as much as possible depending on the amount of effort you put in. These are not given as hard cash but are directly deposited into the school account there by lessening the burden of fees on your parents.

4.I think the most remarkable thing about India is the affordability of quality education .Unlike the education back home ,here our learning process is not just theoretical but very practical as well .We get to do a lot of experiments depending on your faculty.Then through Edoofa we are assured of job opportunities once we finish so this is basically everyone's dream since there are a lot of educated people back home who are jobless .
20/11/23, 8:39 am - Aditi Edoofa: Wishing you a marvelous Monday and a week ahead filled with exciting opportunities.✨
20/11/23, 8:39 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 8:39 am - Aditi Edoofa: You can refer to this document's Training Resources for the correct answers.
20/11/23, 8:57 am - +263 71 924 2804: Okay
20/11/23, 9:00 am - Aditi Edoofa: Lisa, now that we have finished with our training on the $300 plan, you act as a student ambassador for the Edoofa student community. With this empowerment and power, I want to notify you that as a part of your acknowledgment, the Department of Student Welfare will share an undertaking with you that you have to sign denoting that you have understood it.


And post your signature on the understanding that will happen in the coming days, you will be given the certificate stating that you are our Edoofa Certified Student Leader🏆
21/11/23, 10:16 am - +263 71 924 2804: I have gone through the document
21/11/23, 12:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings @263719242804 
Hope you are well.

Amazing, I hope that now you are well aware of the steps.
21/11/23, 12:57 pm - +263 71 924 2804: Yes ma'am

25/11/23, 1:59 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Hello @263719242804 , 

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."✅

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.💡

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.💥

Best regards,
Team EWYL
27/11/23, 1:35 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263719242804 , 
I hope you are doing well. _*Grant Discussion: Your Performance and Eligibility*_

Do you remember the Grant Challenge you participated in? Well, of course, you do, and the time has arrived when we will understand the outcome of the competition you were in!

Your performance has been critically observed, which will determine your eligibility for the grant. I am sure we will have a lot to discuss. Therefore, I have scheduled a discussion with you today.

*Date: 27/11/2023*
*Time: 7:00 PM*
27/11/23, 1:41 pm - +263 71 924 2804: Okay ma'am
27/11/23, 1:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
27/11/23, 2:16 pm - +263 71 924 2804: *Spirit of competition*

Spirit of competition can be defined as having the desire to succeed, winning and also being the best in what you do.
For me it's not just about being rated the best amongst others but rather competing with my former self. Being better ,fighting the bad habits of yesterday.

Basically my whole life cab serve as a testimony. I grew up in a camp since my mom is a prison officer and it has become a norm that a child brought up in this facility goes to school until high school and fails or earns at least 5 subjects which are the average requirement for a job back home. Then after their ordinary level exams they come and join the judiciary service along with their parents.But l wanted to be different ,to excel and explore the outside world.So l was always determined to be the first to differ and break the myths. When I graduated from primary school l was among they  best performers. And l continued to high school and here last l am.l am the first person in my immediate qfamily who passed through high school successfully and not only that but  learning abroad.

Now I'm here and lve set a target for me to always be among the best students in my class
27/11/23, 2:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Your journey is truly inspiring, embracing the spirit of competition not just with others but with your own past. Breaking barriers in a challenging environment shows incredible resilience. As your mentor, I commend your determination to excel and explore beyond expectations. Your success from primary school to learning abroad is a testament to your hard work. I'll support your goal of consistently being among the best in your class, recognizing the value of personal growth and achievement. Keep pushing boundaries and aiming high!
27/11/23, 3:33 pm - +263 71 924 2804: Thank you
27/11/23, 3:39 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am so excited to finally bring out the much-awaited opportunity that you have been waiting for! This is a wonderful time for me as a mentor as a lot of my students are in the process of making use of the Edoofa Grant that was allocated before the start of this academic year and I am sure that you would be curious too.
27/11/23, 3:40 pm - +263 71 924 2804: Indeed
27/11/23, 3:41 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge (or the moment when the Grant was allocated to you by the founders of Edoofa - Mr. Angad & Mr. Avreen Singh); that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $200 annually. 
Do you remember this?
27/11/23, 3:49 pm - +263 71 924 2804: Yes ma'am l remember well , l earned $800 and since I had admission at GGI then and had my course was for 4 years the grant had been divided equally between the 4 years giving $200 annually
27/11/23, 3:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great, let me also help you out on this, 

1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University only if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
27/11/23, 3:53 pm - +263 71 924 2804: Noted
27/11/23, 3:54 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
27/11/23, 3:56 pm - +263 71 924 2804: Yes indeed
27/11/23, 4:05 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
27/11/23, 4:13 pm - +263 71 924 2804: Okay
27/11/23, 4:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
27/11/23, 4:16 pm - +263 71 924 2804: So where am l standing
27/11/23, 4:20 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To make it simple for you to understand - considering a total of 6 sessions have taken place with me (2 in September & 4 in October), 6 webinars (4 in September & 2 in October), and positive attendance in the orientation session that took place at your University, you currently stand at:
27/11/23, 4:21 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Criteria	September + October
Webinar	        2/6
Attendance	4/6
Orientation	Absent
Fee status	CLEAR
27/11/23, 4:22 pm - +263 71 924 2804: Okay
27/11/23, 4:26 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To avoid being confused, we have not included your performance in the month of November as it is still ongoing.
27/11/23, 4:27 pm - +263 71 924 2804: Okay ma'am
27/11/23, 4:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
27/11/23, 4:30 pm - +263 71 924 2804: Yes sure
27/11/23, 4:35 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So now we are wrapping up this session and we will continue this exactly from where we left.
So we will meet for this chat session *tomorrow at 7 PM*.🚀
27/11/23, 4:36 pm - +263 71 924 2804: Okay ma'am

Hope you are well.

Good work Lisa!
28/11/23, 3:31 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Good Evening 🌟
Are you ready for your grant Session? <This message was edited>
28/11/23, 3:42 pm - +263 71 924 2804: Yes
28/11/23, 3:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Also, I can completely understand that you would have been occupied in University classes, assignments, and exams but let me highlight the story of our student Nicassio Simbarashe, who was given the grant opportunity and without compromising any call, any day, he worked on the projects with his utmost attention, attended all the webinars and session with his mentor without fail. For him, it was not an added responsibility, but he considered Edoofa and the time given by his mentor crucial for his personal and professional growth. Making him one of our top earners and best performers.

My aim is not to compare you with any other student but to help build a benchmark for you that we have a big scope for improvement and to showcase our best performance.
28/11/23, 4:18 pm - +263 71 924 2804: Indeed ma'am , l understand
28/11/23, 4:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: We're concluding this session now, and we'll pick up right where we left off. Let's reconvene for our chat session tomorrow at *5 PM.* 🚀
28/11/23, 4:39 pm - +263 71 924 2804: Okay ma'am
29/11/23, 1:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Good evening!
Hope you are well,

Let's begin with today's session🚀
29/11/23, 1:36 pm - +263 71 924 2804: Okay
29/11/23, 1:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
29/11/23, 1:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 1:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Have a look at this so that we can discuss how you can achieve it
29/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 71 924 2804: Done
29/11/23, 1:47 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So do you think it's achievable?
29/11/23, 1:48 pm - +263 71 924 2804: Can you explain more on this
29/11/23, 1:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, sure.

29/11/23, 2:02 pm - +263 71 924 2804: Thank you
29/11/23, 2:06 pm - Aditi Edoofa: What I believe is very simple, you have to be consistent in all the calls and EWYL Group sessions, and in these sessions only I will be sharing ideas that can help you to level up your performance in the project exponentially. Another thing that you have to keep in mind is attending all the webinars without fail because they teach us skills beyond the four walls of the classroom and it directly caters to the idea of you becoming job-ready.
29/11/23, 2:07 pm - +263 71 924 2804: Yes ma'am

 As part of our ongoing commitment to your personal and academic growth, we have scheduled a special activity for this Saturday that involves reflecting on your EWYL (Explore, Wonder, Yearn, Learn) projects.

During this activity, we kindly request each of you to make a small analysis of the input and output of the work you have done in your respective EWYL projects. This analysis should include insights into the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of your efforts. Feel free to share your successes and any unexpected discoveries you made along the way.

Additionally, we encourage you to think about ways in which you can improve upon your results in future projects. This is an excellent opportunity to set goals for personal and academic development.

Remember, growth is a continuous process, and each project offers a valuable opportunity for improvement. We look forward to hearing about your experiences and aspirations.

Best Regards
TEAM EWYL!

Keep engaging with them and highlighting the value of the program to encourage their participation.
