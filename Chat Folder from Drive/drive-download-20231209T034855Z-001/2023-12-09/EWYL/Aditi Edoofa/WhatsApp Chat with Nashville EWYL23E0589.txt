Let me share a short clip about myself.
Please let me know if you face any problems while viewing the video.
31/08/23, 7:51 am - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
31/08/23, 9:25 am - +27 84 339 0698: No problem  faced mam
31/08/23, 9:29 am - +27 84 339 0698: We can move on
31/08/23, 9:37 am - +91 78273 08969: Before we begin understanding the projects and what we will be doing in the EWYL program, I would like to inform you that we will be meeting every weekday, Monday to Friday, from 1:30 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. (Zimbabwe time).
Feel free to express if you have problems regarding the timings so that I can reschedule it so that you can be present and maximize your learning opportunities. Let's have a productive and successful journey.
31/08/23, 9:38 am - +27 84 339 0698: I can adjust to those times , they are perfect... we will have a wonderful  journey together
31/08/23, 2:03 pm - +91 78273 08969: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Nashville?
31/08/23, 2:04 pm - +27 84 339 0698: It sounds very great
31/08/23, 2:07 pm - +91 78273 08969: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
31/08/23, 2:08 pm - +27 84 339 0698: Very interesting 😁😁
31/08/23, 2:08 pm - +91 78273 08969: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
31/08/23, 2:09 pm - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
31/08/23, 2:09 pm - +27 84 339 0698: It should be

31/08/23, 2:23 pm - +91 78273 08969: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
31/08/23, 2:30 pm - +27 84 339 0698: Wow its really hard to render one from the rest cause all the sections are really intriguing,  but haa  the ' two questions  for you' part . This is because   its advice that not only benefits an individual  in particiculr but touches the whole society .Most people tend to believe in the whole Go big or go home triology but in actual facts its just a misconception  of history its self as no big landers or mongrels started it big but had to take all those little steps so they use fully iutilise and make a bigger impact in future
31/08/23, 2:33 pm - +91 78273 08969: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
31/08/23, 2:34 pm - +27 84 339 0698: Wow its truly a remarkable  section and it really motivates a student not only to work hard but also to help the community around them
31/08/23, 2:35 pm - +91 78273 08969: I enjoyed our conversation, I am certain, you would have a better understanding of what your EWYL journey is going to look like, full of knowledge and opportunities to grow and develop yourself. This will be all for today, let us connect tomorrow as I have more in store for you. I would like to focus tomorrow's discussion on making you familiar with our schedule once again and also share what is expected from a dedicated Edoofian. Before we end our discussion for the day, I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from today’s discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.

The company must be in between meaning it should not be too big or too small, also the company should  have sustainable  finances , also the company should have aqequate information  on its humble beginnings. Also after checking all this you have to begin your project by researching through various companies that have started in the referred  dates that 2019 .. Then head to linkedIn to get some few samples of entrepreneurship companies.  AFTER that the start doing research on the company by browsing through its website compling all required details and then u have to check various social media platforms of the company to see which activities they venture  into.

05/09/23, 4:12 pm - +91 78273 08969: There won't be a session tomorrow as I'll be at the airport to receive the students. It's going to be a great experience. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
05/09/23, 5:32 pm - +27 84 339 0698: I understood  that....  community  building  is a project  that focuses on a students networking skills as he or she has to intruduce various students to the Edoofa programme , and also it makes a students  more persuasive through trying  to convince the other students who have finished their high school or are about to .. This project  links to give students from africa , an opportunity  to have a higher learning education which they wont have in their continent and this would help them build up their countries

07/09/23, 2:06 pm - +91 78273 08969: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about
 Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
07/09/23, 2:16 pm - +27 84 339 0698: Okay mam , notted
07/09/23, 2:16 pm - +91 78273 08969: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

07/09/23, 2:46 pm - +91 78273 08969: So Nashville now comes the interesting part where you will be rewarded with scholarship credits for networking with your connection. 
After the student shares their referral and once they have a personalized counseling session with one of our career counselors just like how you have experienced, the counselor will ask some points of the student regarding how they got to know about Edoofa and if they understand our program structure. I hope you will explain to the student as we have discussed right?
07/09/23, 2:49 pm - +27 84 339 0698: Yes we have wena
07/09/23, 2:56 pm - +91 78273 08969: May I know if you have any questions that I can help with?

08/09/23, 6:29 pm - +27 84 339 0698: Okay from what i have gathered . This project aims at introducing the Edoofa programme to various schools , hence the student is required to make a list of secondary to high schools that are in ones locality, make contact with the Head or principal of that school and share with them a remedy of how the Edoofa programme works and how is has benefitted you as well as the experience  you have had with it while highlighting a few details of Edoofa to them , then the student must then share contact details of the director of the Edoofa programme with the principal so they can have a meeting
08/09/23, 6:30 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have- so, congratulations. However, I’d still like to ask- are there any questions you have about this project?
08/09/23, 6:31 pm - +27 84 339 0698: For now its all clear
08/09/23, 6:34 pm - +91 78273 08969: Okay great, now allow me to recap this project quickly for you in 2 steps:

 Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - *EDOOFA -Education For All*

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *a lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as a mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉

Edoofa is a *social-for-profit organization* that aims to help deserving students with life-changing opportunities to further their careers through affordable higher education as well as internship opportunities✨.

In short, Edoofa is an embedded higher education program. They stay with the student throughout their academic life as mentors and caretakers, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge being a Proud Edoofian!

_Over the past 5 years, after counseling tens of thousands of students, Edoofa has gone in-depth in understanding the problems that students face. The Edoofa Program removes every obstacle standing between your student and his/her higher education dreams. Edoofa as an organization wants to make higher education affordable for every student studying in your school. Coupled with the Earn While You Learn Program, Edoofa wants to make your students employable who are equipped with all the skills that today’s industry needs, so that when a student from your school would return to your country, he/she has got more opportunities to chase him/her as compared to peers and so that you can add value to your school as well as country’s development/growth._



Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, they have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. Edoofa has been associated with more than *100 schools*. This includes collaboration with more than _250 Headmasters, Chairman SDC, and Educationists_ who have been part of our long partnership benefitting the students to accomplish their international dream of studying in India.

Their associate partner, *Mr. Shorwi Kawadza* is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of *Hartzell High School*. Hartzell High School, Mutare has collaborated with them for the past *Four Years* from which more than _80 students_ have enrolled and arrived in India already.

08/09/23, 6:58 pm - +91 78273 08969: Along with this, schools can be benefited in the following way:

08/09/23, 7:00 pm - +27 84 339 0698: Okay
08/09/23, 7:00 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now, Nashville- we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
08/09/23, 7:05 pm - +27 84 339 0698: Haa i dont have any , but will update if i cone across sone difficulty
08/09/23, 7:06 pm - +91 78273 08969: It’s amazing to be your partner in this EWYL journey. Till now, we’ve spoken to each other about our goals for this year, the promise of earning and learning well through this program, we went over 3 of the projects specially curated for Edoofians to get started with earning scholarship credits and their journey of learning relevant skills like communication, networking, and leadership to name a few.

However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!

*So, are you excited to find out what this is?*
08/09/23, 7:07 pm - +27 84 339 0698: Yes i am
08/09/23, 7:08 pm - +91 78273 08969: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!
 Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.
08/09/23, 7:08 pm - +27 84 339 0698: I understand
08/09/23, 7:15 pm - +91 78273 08969: *SEO* - Search engine optimization is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic rather than direct traffic or paid traffic.

*Influencer marketing* - Influencer marketing is a form of social media marketing involving endorsements and product placement from influencers, people, and organizations who have a purported expert level of knowledge or social influence in their field.

*Blog writing*- Blogging refers to writing, photography, and other media that are self-published online. Blogging started as an opportunity for individuals to write diary-style entries, but it has since been incorporated into websites for many businesses.
08/09/23, 7:17 pm - +27 84 339 0698: Pkay
08/09/23, 7:19 pm - +91 78273 08969: So, Nashville, since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
08/09/23, 7:20 pm - +27 84 339 0698: Okay mam
08/09/23, 7:21 pm - +91 78273 08969: There are a few additional things that are required for you to be selected for a project. I want you to share the following with me

12/09/23, 1:51 pm - +91 78273 08969: To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that you will be having. I would like to brief you about the roles of your Counselor, your Admission Officer, and your EWYL Mentor. 
During your journey with Edoofa, you majorly go through 3 stages! Do you have any idea what might be the three stages?

Your *counselor* is your _first point of contact_. Your counselor has been guiding you during your _onboarding process_ where you learned about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same. 
After that, you are contacted by your _Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with your admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all your admissions-related queries like your _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._

Finally, you will be starting your _EWYL journey with your EWYL Mentor,_ where you get a chance to learn *21st-century job skills* and *earn scholarship credits* which will ultimately help you fund your higher education. Your Mentor will be involved with you at every step and will be guiding your way throughout your journey. Your mentor will be your closest point of contact who will help you build your personality along with your skill set. All your queries related to your EWYL program will be addressed by your mentor.
Note: Your EWYL mentor will not be addressing your admission queries
I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries.
12/09/23, 1:52 pm - +27 84 339 0698: L am agreed
12/09/23, 1:54 pm - +91 78273 08969: I hope you have received the Newsletter, From now on we will have our session as per the schedule we discussed and on Wednesday you will receive your lesson and activity on Saturday. But any queries after your session time in EWYL should be addressed here in the EWYL group. And do not forget to perform the Proud Edoofian Ritual daily in your dedicated EWYL line.

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Aditi your new mentor will contact you on Tuesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Aditi's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.

18/10/23, 4:24 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here's a new assignment for you: create a video where you share your journey as an Edoofian. This video will not only save you time and energy when explaining the program but will also improve communication and boost your confidence.
And I have already done 50% of the work as I took out some time and jotted some points to help you out.
18/10/23, 4:24 pm - +91 73038 57260: Thats wonderful
18/10/23, 4:35 pm - Aditi Edoofa: You have to create a 2-3 min video about your journey in Edoofa.

And in order to help you out, I'm providing some guidelines to simplify the process. You can discuss these key points in your video to ensure it is informative and adds value.

a) Your journey so far with the program
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) Highlighting the importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with your counselor and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Your initial feedback on how life is different in India how the basic amenities are cheaper as compared to your homeland (you may use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by yourself and struggling with the process. (you may ask for DSW's Help in explaining the normal process as compared to Edoofa's Process)
f) Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.
18/10/23, 4:35 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, we're wrapping up our session. There were some crucial discussions we couldn't cover; I encourage your active participation and respond timely because I believe you understand the significance of the EWYL session.

This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

15/11/23, 4:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: WEDNESDAY LESSON OF THE WEEK

Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL
