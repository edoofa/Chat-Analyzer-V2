02/11/23, 3:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Edoofa is an organization that fosters careers and empowers students to progress in a more positive direction, achieving the right balance of exposure and opportunities, alongside education, is essential for a student's overall growth.

With this principle in mind, I am thrilled to share how our students are balancing correctly between exposure and experience with their academics:
⭕A group of our students recently participated in a football tournament, and we are immensely proud to announce that they reached the competition's semifinals.

⭕Another group of students participated in a debate competition, and I am delighted to add that two of our students emerged as winners.

⭕Furthermore, our students regularly come together for interactive sessions with their fellow Edoofians, building stronger relationships and providing mutual support.
