Let us begin our session with a fun fact: Do you know that butterflies taste with their feet! They have special sensors on their tiny footpads that help them 'taste' their surroundings. It's like having a built-in flavor detector on their feet! 🦋👣
27/11/23, 1:14 pm - +263 77 727 1107: Hie Ms Ananya how are you today?
27/11/23, 1:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Trish!

Did you know that India and Africa share a rich history of diplomatic and trade relations that dates back centuries? The strong bond between these two regions has been further strengthened in recent years through collaborative efforts in various sectors, including trade, infrastructure, and technology.

Let us cherish this amazing bond, and start our session !
27/11/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 727 1107: Yes i know this mam
27/11/23, 1:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
27/11/23, 1:43 pm - +263 77 727 1107: No i don't understand which two objectives?
27/11/23, 1:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
27/11/23, 1:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
27/11/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 727 1107: Ok i understand mam
27/11/23, 1:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
27/11/23, 1:48 pm - +263 77 727 1107: Thanks for introducing them to me
27/11/23, 1:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
27/11/23, 1:50 pm - +263 77 727 1107: Yes interesting mam
27/11/23, 1:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
27/11/23, 1:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 727 1107: Yes I'm done reading the newsletter so interesting
27/11/23, 1:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
27/11/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 727 1107: I liked section B in which we exchange cultures
27/11/23, 2:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
27/11/23, 2:05 pm - +263 77 727 1107: Yes is it and i also noticed the Edoofa Hall inspiration
27/11/23, 2:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
27/11/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 727 1107: Sounds good mam

Did you know there's a big word, 'paraskavedekatriaphobia,' which means being afraid of Friday the 13th? Some folks get spooked on this day and avoid doing important stuff. 😵‍💫

But you know what's funny? Statistically, it's not more accident-prone than any other day. So, if someone tells you they're scared of Friday the 13th, you can just say it's all in their head! <This message was edited>
07/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 727 1107: How are you mam
07/12/23, 1:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Trish, It has been observed that you are quite inconsistent with your sessions. May I ask the reason behind your inconsistency?
07/12/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 727 1107: Yes mam it is true that is because during the day i might be busy and sometimes network misbehave  thus wy i wasn't able to catch up with you some past days
07/12/23, 1:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Trish, you could have informed me as well, no?
07/12/23, 7:34 pm - +263 77 727 1107: I informed you mam i even request for a favour of change our session time
07/12/23, 7:34 pm - +263 77 727 1107: On this message
08/12/23, 8:29 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Trish!

Due to some personal reasons, I won't be able to connect for our session today. However, I had a plan for our session, which I am stating now.

With years of experience, I want you to accumulate some credits before you come here to India. Students who have already earned some credits are living much better lives as they can help their parents with travel costs and even semester fees. I am sure you have also signed up for EWYL, so that you can do the same. As your mentor, I want to ensure that you utilize our services and earn for yourself. Now, have some faith in me and start working.

As a starting point, I have a small target for you for the day! Connect with at least *2 students* today under your community building project and submit the application forms to me by tomorrow. By tomorrow, you will either be successful with the two students or may face some challenges, on which we will work together!

All the best!
08/12/23, 9:35 am - +263 77 727 1107: Hie morning how are you mam i don't understand which students the one's which are still at high School or those who accomplished
