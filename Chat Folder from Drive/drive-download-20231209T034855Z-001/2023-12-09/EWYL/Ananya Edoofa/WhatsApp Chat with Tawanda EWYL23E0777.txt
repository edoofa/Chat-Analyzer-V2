Soccer and chess are such cool hobbies, and then you've got this artistic side too. Do you ever combine your love for art with journalism, like through visual storytelling or editorial illustrations?

20/10/23, 1:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
21/10/23, 8:56 am - +263 71 606 1410: Good morning Ms Ananya ,how are you? 
Yes I have understood the two objectives. Thank you
21/10/23, 9:47 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Tawanda!

Kindly excuse me for the delay, I was attending an important meeting with the head of our department.
21/10/23, 9:50 am - +263 71 606 1410: I am fine and how are you?
21/10/23, 10:02 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am doing good, Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
21/10/23, 10:02 am - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
21/10/23, 10:04 am - +263 71 606 1410: It's duly noted.
21/10/23, 10:10 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 10:10 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
21/10/23, 10:16 am - +263 71 606 1410: Wow this is amazing, I have finished reading it,  thank you.
21/10/23, 10:18 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
21/10/23, 10:23 am - +263 71 606 1410: Good morning EWYL team.
23/10/23, 9:55 am - +263 71 606 1410: Good morning
23/10/23, 9:56 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Tawanda!

How are you doing today?
23/10/23, 9:57 am - +263 71 606 1410: I am doing great and how are you?
23/10/23, 9:58 am - Ananya Edoofa: Thank you for asking, Tawanda! I am doing good!
23/10/23, 9:58 am - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.

23/10/23, 3:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Tawanda, I hope you understand that these sessions are very important. I want you to arrange a hotspot device. I'm worried that if this doesn't happen, you may fall behind.

23/10/23, 3:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

23/10/23, 4:10 pm - +263 71 606 1410: I have gone through it. Thank you
25/10/23, 9:48 am - +263 71 606 1410: Good morning
25/10/23, 9:51 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Tawanda!

25/10/23, 1:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/10/23, 2:44 pm - +264 81 336 4203: Good afternoon Ms Ananya.I am Tawanda's mother and I see that you are trying to engage him for his sessions.I have been trying to get hold of him and the rest of the people at home but they seem to be unavailable some since yesterday and this morning respectively.Of late there is an ongoing electricity crisis in Zimbabwe and like that it greatly affects the efficiency of mobile networks.I would like to presume that that could be the reason they are not available.I have experienced these episodes of bad network systems during my vacational leave and sometimes it can be very bad.I shall continue trying to get hold of him and the family.I understand the importance of these sessions and I would like to believe that him being unavailable is just beyond his control.
27/10/23, 12:25 pm - +263 71 606 1410: Good afternoon Ms Ananya, I am sorry for missing yesterday's session, it was because there was  a blackout. We had 2 straight days without electricity. I am sorry I wasn't able to inform you beforehand as it happened unexpectedly. I am truly sorry.
27/10/23, 1:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tawanda!

30/10/23, 2:29 pm - +263 71 606 1410: And for the 3rd one, it is a technology company.
30/10/23, 2:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, The first and second companies are student-centric companies which means that if they partner with us, this will help our students as they can provide our students with projects and in some cases, even employment opportunities.

August 2024 or August 2025
01/11/23, 1:59 pm - +263 71 606 1410: It's duly noted. Thank you very much
01/11/23, 2:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
01/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 71 606 1410: It's duly noted.
01/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 71 606 1410: I have a  question.
01/11/23, 2:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
01/11/23, 2:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
01/11/23, 2:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
01/11/23, 2:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
01/11/23, 2:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
01/11/23, 2:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
01/11/23, 2:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

I will be appearing for my Advance Level Examination in (Year):-

August 2023 or August 2024 or August 2025
01/11/23, 2:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 2:13 pm - +263 71 606 1410: It's duly noted,  thank you .
01/11/23, 2:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
01/11/23, 2:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*

Best of Luck!

Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
07/11/23, 1:56 pm - +263 71 606 1410: Right now I don't have.

07/11/23, 2:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉
