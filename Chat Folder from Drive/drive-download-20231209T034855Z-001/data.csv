150 - 08 Dec 2023 02:06PM - Aditi Edoofa: That’s awesome, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.   1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!
151 - 08 Dec 2023 02:06PM - Aditi Edoofa: Offline Application Form  Student Name: Date Of Birth: Gender: Email Address: Student's WhatsApp Number:  Father's Name : Father's Contact Number/WhatsApp Number (With Country Code): Father's Profession/Nature of employment:  Mother’s Name: Guardian/Mother's Contact Number (With Country Code): Mother's Profession/Nature of employment:  Country: School Name : Schools Province :  Which course would you like to study?  Subject Combination in A Level:- Current Class ( L6/ U6/ A Level Appeared):  I will be appearing for my A Level (Year):-  Preferred year of Admission:- (August 2024 or August 2025)
152 - 08 Dec 2023 02:06PM - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here- 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*. 2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*. 3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!

154 - 08 Dec 2023 02:33PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
155 - 08 Dec 2023 02:34PM - Aditi Edoofa: *-A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*  STEP 1: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them- STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME For eg: In your case, it will be- *ANOTIDA/ADITI*
156 - 08 Dec 2023 02:34PM - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.  The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
157 - 08 Dec 2023 02:34PM - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination). Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6. Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)  Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
158 - 08 Dec 2023 02:34PM - Aditi Edoofa: ADD MENTOR:  Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.  The purpose of doing this is that: - I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill - I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly. - I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students",No,Yes

180 - 08 Dec 2023 02:30PM - Aditi Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:  Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
181 - 08 Dec 2023 02:30PM - Aditi Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
182 - 08 Dec 2023 02:31PM - Aditi Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍  Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
183 - 08 Dec 2023 02:31PM - Aditi Edoofa: You know, Edoofa is also working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr. G.M Chipare. We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Herewith I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.",No,Yes

As a college student, mastering the basics of Excel can significantly enhance productivity and efficiency in handling data. Excel provides a structured and customizable platform for organizing large amounts of data, such as class schedules, assignment deadlines, and grades. It also allows for the creation of visually appealing charts and graphs for presentations, enhancing communication and critical thinking.  The Excel interface is a grid of cells arranged in columns and rows, where data is entered and manipulated. Basic formulas include the SUM function, AVERAGE function, MAX and MIN functions, IF function, and VLOOKUP function. Excel offers a vast array of functions and features that can be explored as users become more comfortable with the software. By mastering the basics of Excel, college students can enhance their analytical abilities, which are valuable in various academic disciplines and future professional endeavors.

I believe that if you perform well, you can definitely become eligible for the grant, but I want to know the points where you believe you are left behind and still are not eligible for the grant? 2. What do you think are the areas you would have to work harder to cross that line and get you to be eligible for the grant? 3. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?

299 - 08 Dec 2023 03:39PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, since you have now seen your performance table, I would appreciate it if you answer the following questions so that we can discuss our plan of action *tomorrow* for December accordingly:  1. I believe that if you perform well, you can definitely become eligible for the grant, but I want to know the points where you believe you are left behind and still are not eligible for the grant? 2. What do you think are the areas you would have to work harder to cross that line and get you to be eligible for the grant? 3. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?

216 - 08 Dec 2023 08:02AM - +263 78 580 0065: SATURDAY 'S ACTIVITY  When doing my projects I am getting to know about each them, Paying much attention to my 2nd project ( Community building) I learnt a lot when trying to connect with students from different regions.  The skills i ensure should be mastered inorder to produce positive results: communication skills, persuasion skills etc. These skills are the most significant when connecting with students, in the event that you're somebody who's ignorant, you don't reply messages from other peers in time, you would not get it right you miss them students. They would be applying for other organizations. Students require someone who encourage them to take opportunities as they are, use them wisely and also frame ways to help their parents understand the same.Parents play a crucial role when it comes to the ongoing process of studying abroad, if they find this costy they would request their children to study locally.  The other thing regarding the 2nd project is competition, there are many organizations outhere which are claiming to help students with opportunities to study Abroad in the same way as Edoofa do. So our students might end up having the idea that Edoofa is way  more expensive than others so as an individual I'm facing great challenges to persuade and cancel those with such point of view. For my 3rd project ( African Shoools Reform Mission) I'm eager to learn more when connecting with Headmasters.  I'm glad to sail through this project I will be learning ways on how to touch them professionally.  It is better if I develop this professional touch inside myself. However, even if some Headmasters aren't responding earlier, I learnt that Persistence is very important.  So to improve on my respective projects, I am thinking of consistently connecting with each and every individual who has got interests to study Abroad alongside a scholarship.  More importantly, I'm planning reaching out  to students informing them about our EWYL program to factor out the the idea that higher education from is not affordable.
217 - 08 Dec 2023 09:19AM - Ananya Edoofa: _*Session Postponed*_  Due to some personal reasons, I won't be able to connect for our session today. Kindly submit your wednesday lesson on your EWYL Line so that I can assess it later in the day.  While we are not connecting today I want you to invest 1.5 hours more on your project. Looking at your progress I think you can submit two student application forms to me by tomorrow! So all the very best!🚀

236 - 08 Dec 2023 08:51AM - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.* You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa. Best of Luck!
237 - 08 Dec 2023 08:58AM - +263 78 412 2571: Ok

359 - 08 Dec 2023 04:02PM - Saloni Edoofa: Well, since you have now seen your performance table, I would appreciate it if you answer the following questions so that we can discuss our plan of action for December accordingly:  1. I believe that if you perform well, you can definitely become eligible for the grant, but I want to know the points where you believe you are left behind and still are not eligible for the grant? 2. What do you think are the areas you would have to work harder to cross that line and get you to be eligible for the grant? 3. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?

393 - 04 Dec 2023 02:13PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon Kirsty, How are you?  Today, I would want you to frame 3-4 messages explaining your journey so far from the counseling process to the admission team and then starting your EWYL Program. You also have to add how you can financially support yourself through the EWYL Program, projects that are available and a message that calls for patience, progress, and growth.
394 - 08 Dec 2023 06:53AM - +263 78 667 6332: 1. The Earn While You Learn Program has been an incredible journey so far. The counseling process was so eye-opening, and I gained so much self-awareness. I'm excited to begin my studies, and I know that the financial support I'll receive will make all the difference. I'm also looking forward to all the opportunities that will come my way through this program. <This message was edited>

I also know that growth is an important part of this journey, and I'm committed to growing both personally and professionally.

Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6. Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
155 - 08 Dec 2023 09:28AM - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
156 - 08 Dec 2023 09:28AM - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120

Edoofa offers internships and industry oriented training that is enshrined into the university's curriculum... the program also provides an opportunity to earn scholarship credits through an EWYL program ... this reduces fees of higher education and gives us the students work experience making us more employable  2. The Earn While You Learn program is a program designed to provide us the students with internship opportunities from influential organizations to work on projects part time and gain valuable skills all whilst still studying... this in turn provides scholarship credits that will help lower the cost of learning  3. Firstly is the application stage... following this is when one gets in touch with career counselors through one on one sessions... after this... one is expected to pass the eligiblity check interview at by the edoofa program directors and academic board... once cleared one will receive an acceptance letter... after receiving the acceptance letter the student gets in touch with the admissions team and a statement of purpose is drawn out and University admission is finalized all while working with the EWYL mentors to earn credits... lastly is the preparation to travel which can be assisted by the admissions team  4. The testimonial I'll be writing about is from Prince Dhilawayo a Zimbabwean who's been in India for two months (as per the video)... he strongly appreciates the edoofa team for taking him thus far and also appreciates the country and it's education system",No,No

Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. It fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *""I am a proud Edoofian*.

I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?""  Before we unravel the answer, let's ponder on a quote from the legendary Steve Jobs: ""Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work.""

257 - 08 Dec 2023 08:41AM - Sharda Edoofa: Now, the riddle's answer is an echo. Just like an echo, our actions reverberate in the world, shaping the narrative of our lives. Steve Jobs' quote underscores the importance of finding passion and purpose in our endeavors. It's not just about going through the motions; it's about doing work that resonates with your inner self.

116 - 07 Dec 2023 01:38PM - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon Tanaka You are most welcome.  As we embark on today's session, let's kick-start our journey with a dose of inspiration from Jeff Bezos, the visionary founder of Amazon:  Your brand is what other people say about you when you're not in the room Now, what does this mean to you? Imagine you're creating your personal brand every day. It's not just about how you see yourself; it's about the impression you leave on others. Whether you're in the classroom, chatting with friends, or pursuing your hobbies, you're shaping your brand—the way people perceive you.  So, let's dive into today's session with the mindset of crafting a brand that reflects your strengths, values, and aspirations. Together, we'll explore ways to amplify your unique qualities and set the stage for success, not just academically, but in every aspect of your lives.  Remember, each interaction, each achievement, contributes to your brand. Let's make it a story of growth, resilience, and positive impact!

I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?"" Before we unravel the answer, let's ponder on a quote from the legendary Steve Jobs: ""Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work.""

133 - 08 Dec 2023 02:22PM - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.  *NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*",No,Yes

But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*  Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship.  I hope you are confident about achieving it.",No,Yes

183 - 08 Dec 2023 12:39PM - Arshita: As per your understanding how much is the cost of education and by when do you need to pay if found eligible?
184 - 08 Dec 2023 12:44PM - +263 78 079 3505: Registration fee is too expensive and program fee is also expensive. I will pay when my mother has  adequate funds if I am eligible.
185 - 08 Dec 2023 12:50PM - Arshita: Nicole, I do understand the financial challenges but then I was asking as per your understanding how much is the registration fee and enrollment fee and what is the timeframe in which you have to pay if found eligible.
186 - 08 Dec 2023 12:53PM - +263 78 079 3505: As per my understanding, registration fee is $500 to $1000 and enrollment is $350. First part of registration will be in August 2024  and remaining in January 2025 Enrollment is paid in 7days and the remaining $150 in the next 30 days.
187 - 08 Dec 2023 01:49PM - Arshita: Let me help you gain a better understanding of the registration fee. The registration fee($500-$1000) is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter.  *The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived off from the cost of education.*  For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $2200 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $2200-600= $1600

78 - 08 Dec 2023 02:09PM - Arshita: *2. Its Universities Are Well-Ranked and Climbing*- From politics/law to philosophy and biology to business and media/journalism there’s something for everyone in India’s massive higher education system.

309 - 08 Dec 2023 02:51PM - Austin: There are two important reasons why the 2025 intake has been open now!  1) Zimbabwean students receive the results very late compared to other African Nations. The WAEC results of Ghana, Nigeria and other Western African Nations are declared mid-year. Malawians receive around the same time, Zambians receive the results much earlier compared to Zimbabwe, and students from other nations will be occupying the majority of the scholarship seats. This is the reason, we evaluate the O level and term results, interests and passion, career goals, extracurriculars, achievements, roles of responsibilities etc to evaluate the form 6 students for the Edoofa scholarship program. We also give the opportunity to parents to take part in the sessions on behalf of applicants so that deserving applicants do not miss the golden opportunity.",No,No

Without a schoolarship the average cost of studying in India is 6000 to 8000  4. With  the help  of Edoofa the anual fee is reduced  to 2000 to 3000  5. The enrolment fee is $500-700  some is paid in August 2024 after coming to India and the remaining can  be paid in 2025  6. From  my  understanding the Earn While You  Learn Program  are some small  jobs that are done after  school  where the student is directly  involved in the field for instance Digitalisation of Industry like Miss Arshita said you learn how to become an all-rounder in the ever changing professional. how to network like a boss .I think  the student gains the basic working principles before graduating. Ultimately the earn while you  learn  Program  offers scholarship credits which  reduces one's tuition. The credit amount depends on  the work  rate of the student and one can earn about $1800  annually which will  reduce yhe tuition fee by about %40  . It helps to mobilize students to work professionally as they are directly involved in the field  7. Yes i knoe that as clearly elaborated by Miss Arshita

Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

157 - 08 Dec 2023 09:13AM - +260 772038434: Good morning yes today active participation will be involved
158 - 08 Dec 2023 10:05AM - Gurvinder: So let us continue the session.
159 - 08 Dec 2023 10:05AM - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
160 - 08 Dec 2023 10:05AM - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
161 - 08 Dec 2023 10:06AM - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

163 - 08 Dec 2023 10:06AM - +260 772038434: Ok
164 - 08 Dec 2023 10:07AM - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:  *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*
165 - 08 Dec 2023 10:13AM - +260 772038434: This provisions will run until the student is done with the course
166 - 08 Dec 2023 10:35AM - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct, In simple words Berthel what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
167 - 08 Dec 2023 10:39AM - +260 772038434: I now understand Mr Gurvinder
168 - 08 Dec 2023 10:55AM - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
169 - 08 Dec 2023 10:56AM - +260 772038434: Yes
170 - 08 Dec 2023 11:19AM - Gurvinder: Berthel, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

171 - 08 Dec 2023 11:23AM - +260 772038434: It's a very interesting program it helps the students develop more skills
172 - 08 Dec 2023 12:28PM - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.  *1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*  The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:  -_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market.

218 - 08 Dec 2023 01:18PM - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.
219 - 08 Dec 2023 01:18PM - Gurvinder: I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
220 - 08 Dec 2023 01:20PM - +260 772038434: Yes I would be glad to know
221 - 08 Dec 2023 01:23PM - Gurvinder: Berthel, by now, I hope you have understood that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is not merely a platform for students to gain admission to an internationally recognized university. It offers much more. Among various differentiators, the value provided by Edoofa to a particular student surpasses that offered by any admission agent or consultant.
222 - 08 Dec 2023 01:29PM - +260 772038434: Yes I have understood that Edoofa Scholarship program is not merely a platform for students to gain administration but it offers more than scholarships for it's students
223 - 08 Dec 2023 01:58PM - Gurvinder: Alright Berthel, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.

227 - 08 Dec 2023 02:23PM - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.  Are you ready?

229 - 08 Dec 2023 02:26PM - Gurvinder: Berthel, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*",No,Yes

Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*.
58 - 08 Dec 2023 09:50AM - Gurvinder: But I realize that you want to do a course that makes your parent proud and also align with your passion.

18 - 08 Dec 2023 11:20AM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
19 - 08 Dec 2023 11:20AM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*

We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already.

21 - 08 Dec 2023 11:21AM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_

201 - 08 Dec 2023 01:20PM - Gurvinder: Exactly Prominent, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
202 - 08 Dec 2023 01:20PM - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
203 - 08 Dec 2023 01:22PM - +263 77 895 0480: I got you
204 - 08 Dec 2023 01:24PM - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students.  Don’t you think so?
205 - 08 Dec 2023 01:26PM - +263 77 895 0480: I think so
206 - 08 Dec 2023 01:55PM - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
207 - 08 Dec 2023 01:55PM - Gurvinder: Prominent basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation  If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.  *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).  *Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.  *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
208 - 08 Dec 2023 01:55PM - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
209 - 08 Dec 2023 02:00PM - +263 77 895 0480: Clear sir
210 - 08 Dec 2023 02:14PM - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.  Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?",No,Yes

164 - 08 Dec 2023 10:44AM - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
165 - 08 Dec 2023 10:44AM - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
166 - 08 Dec 2023 10:44AM - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

161 - 08 Dec 2023 09:51AM - +263 77 350 7141: No not yet
162 - 08 Dec 2023 10:19AM - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
163 - 08 Dec 2023 10:22AM - +263 77 350 7141: No we are not
164 - 08 Dec 2023 10:44AM - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
165 - 08 Dec 2023 10:44AM - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
166 - 08 Dec 2023 10:44AM - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
167 - 08 Dec 2023 10:44AM - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
168 - 08 Dec 2023 10:44AM - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:  *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*

169 - 08 Dec 2023 12:28PM - +263 77 350 7141: Okay
170 - 08 Dec 2023 12:28PM - +263 77 350 7141: It's affordable
171 - 08 Dec 2023 12:52PM - Gurvinder: In simple words Heather what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
172 - 08 Dec 2023 12:52PM - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
173 - 08 Dec 2023 12:54PM - +263 77 350 7141: Okay
174 - 08 Dec 2023 01:04PM - Gurvinder: Heather, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
175 - 08 Dec 2023 04:15PM - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.  Have a good day ahead. God Bless You!",No,No

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.  I hope to get a positive response from you soon.

Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
21 - 08 Dec 2023 12:09PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
22 - 08 Dec 2023 12:09PM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.

23 - 08 Dec 2023 12:09PM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
24 - 08 Dec 2023 01:35PM - +263 71 443 3551: Yes you are right sir
25 - 08 Dec 2023 01:47PM - +263 71 443 3551: Thank you sir I understand now
26 - 08 Dec 2023 02:06PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Last, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
27 - 08 Dec 2023 02:06PM - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
28 - 08 Dec 2023 07:03PM - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.  Have a good day ahead. God Bless You!

241 - 07 Dec 2023 02:00PM - Gurvinder: Liberty as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
242 - 07 Dec 2023 07:58PM - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

27 - 08 Dec 2023 12:27PM - Gurvinder: Yes Sibongile, that is all I want.
28 - 08 Dec 2023 12:27PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Sibongile, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
29 - 08 Dec 2023 12:27PM - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

110 - 08 Dec 2023 10:17AM - Gurvinder: So let us continue the session now.
111 - 08 Dec 2023 10:17AM - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
112 - 08 Dec 2023 10:17AM - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
113 - 08 Dec 2023 10:17AM - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

115 - 08 Dec 2023 10:18AM - Gurvinder: In simple words Ropafadzo what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.  However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
116 - 08 Dec 2023 10:50AM - +263 77 583 1671: Ok

119 - 08 Dec 2023 12:34PM - Gurvinder: Ropafadzo, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

121 - 08 Dec 2023 02:06PM - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.  *1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*  The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:  -_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market.

86 - 08 Dec 2023 02:14PM - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Mashura, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you.  Don’t you agree?

D 11. A 12. B 13.C 14. B 15. D 16. B  Section 5:  Title:Life In Rwanda  16  Years After The Genocide  The genocide that took place in Rwanda is still greatly remembered by many residents of Rwanda. the effects of that genocide led to women suffering the consequences of rape and sexual abuse  .Many children were orphaned and had to survive on their own , Alot of survivors  developed long-term psychological problems .However, overtime Rwanda rebuilt itself and many people played an important role in its development. During the five years of civil war that culminated in the 1994 genocide,GDP declined in three out of five posting a rapid decline at more than fourty percent in 1994.  Residents of Rwanda enjoy a low corruption rate and high quality of life making the country an ideal location for innovative ideas ,research and exploration.  Rwanda has made significant progress in rebuilding and developing since 1994 genocide . However, the small and landlocked country of nearly fourteen million people face many challenges today including inflation and high unemployment rates. Therefore the Rwanda genocide brought about a great impact to Rwanda's history and current upbringing .  Section 6: "" My Inspirational Story""  My name is Namwaka Mubonda , my long life story begins from childhood of which was favourable and one cannot complain.So , my journey began at Njase Girls Secondary school where i learnt alot of things and my moral life was more improved , at first in the beginning of my journey at Njase Girls i faced alot of challenges with adapting to a new place , new learning set up but as time went on I learnt to understand alot .Ofcourse friends were part of my journey but some friends are there only in good times while others are there all the time .Well, school was quite an adventure because i learnt alot of practical skills through the field trips that were available at that time , there was a point in life where i felt like nothing was going well so as my grades were put on the line but all thanks to God almighty i was able to overcome that storm and because of that storm i faced in the third term of my grade eleven year i got to understand things in a different way and see people in a different way.Because of that storm i learnt that not everyone who claims to be your friend is actually your friend but i also got to  meet real friends and very helpful when it came to giving advise  . In my twelfth grade i buckled up myself and concentrated on my studies and duties of being a prefect though i spent alot of days and nights studying for the exam that was going to determine my future i still didn't lose focus of what i wanted in life . Being an opthamologist was and has always been my dream to achieve so that i can assist many lives out there and improve many people's way of life at large . Through my senior friends Juliet Mwenda and Francine Chilabi i got to learn about the Edoofa program and knowing this program and taking part in it has really helped me and brightened me for the future out there. So if i was given a chance to advise anyone out there who at some point felt like things were not going well for them , i would say when things look as though  there is no way of things getting well, God always has a way to fix things and can make one's life a living testimony  .Therefore faith,courage ,hardwork ,honesty and determination are one of the keys to succeed in life and overcome many obstacles. <This message was edited>

156 - 08 Dec 2023 08:03AM - +263 78 590 4287: Morning how are you sir
157 - 08 Dec 2023 09:46AM - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?

159 - 08 Dec 2023 10:53AM - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
160 - 08 Dec 2023 10:53AM - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
161 - 08 Dec 2023 10:53AM - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

159 - 08 Dec 2023 10:53AM - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

161 - 08 Dec 2023 10:53AM - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
162 - 08 Dec 2023 10:53AM - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
163 - 08 Dec 2023 10:53AM - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:  *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*

It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional.

Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!

28 - 08 Dec 2023 12:03PM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
29 - 08 Dec 2023 12:07PM - +263 77 437 5439: Yes,  sir that my dream too since l was young
30 - 08 Dec 2023 12:36PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Prig A, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
31 - 08 Dec 2023 12:36PM - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
32 - 08 Dec 2023 12:51PM - +263 77 437 5439: Yes,  sir l am ready to go

35 - 08 Dec 2023 01:07PM - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of responsibility towards your child @263773443262 @263774066067 .

54 - 08 Dec 2023 02:03PM - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
55 - 08 Dec 2023 02:03PM - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.

62 - 08 Dec 2023 02:38PM - Gurvinder: *Bachelor of Arts - Bachelor of Legislative Law* calls for the candidates with attention to detail, reasoning and critical judgment skills. The students having an ability to draft formal documents with precision are perfect for this course. This course is made for the students who are able to formulate sound arguments, can think laterally and possess problem solving skills.
63 - 08 Dec 2023 02:39PM - Gurvinder: A course in BA LLB is an exciting one that offers multiple career opportunities. The 5 key positions associated with this course are:  *1) Legal Advisor* The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.  The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.  *2) Lawyer* As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law. Their main job role is to represent their clients in jurisdiction matters. Their work involves a lot of research, including that on the subject and their client’s perspective. They then go on to represent and defend their clients in the court.  *3) Public Prosecutor* A Public Prosecutor is a criminal lawyer who is hired by the government. He may either be hired by the central or the state government to represent the interests of the state in any criminal trial. Their role starts once the police have investigated and filed the charge sheet in court. The expectation from the Public Prosecutor is that he acts in the interests of the general public and is fair and ethical. The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor.  *4) Judge* This role is considered to be very prestigious by any law student. Immediately after the completion of graduation, an individual can appear for a lower judiciary exam. The age group depending on different states varies between 21 to 35 years. The qualities of righteousness, good ethics and a passion for justice are some of the key qualities needed for this job.  *5) Company Secretary* This job is for students who want to work in the corporate sector. This job requires a degree from ICSI or the Institute of Company secretaries of India. A lot of dedication and hard work is required to complete this course with your law degree, but on successful completion, this career can be extremely rewarding.  A career in law is considered to be much sought after, satisfying and lucrative.

Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_

199 - 08 Dec 2023 11:22AM - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.  I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
200 - 08 Dec 2023 11:24AM - +263 77 776 6715: It is what i am looking for
201 - 08 Dec 2023 11:28AM - +263 77 776 6715: Im inspired
202 - 08 Dec 2023 11:39AM - +263 77 776 6715: I have a question sir.Is there any possibility of working to get admission lets say one has had the scholarship
203 - 08 Dec 2023 12:34PM - Gurvinder: Please elaborate your question, Samathar.
204 - 08 Dec 2023 01:11PM - +263 77 776 6715: I mean since Edoofa  helps the reduction of fees and Accommodation..Is there  a possibility for a prospective candidate to start the Learn while you earn program to cover the needed amount
205 - 08 Dec 2023 01:16PM - Gurvinder: The EWYL program starts when you enroll with the Edoofa Program before even you get the admission acceptance letter, I will address this concern elaborately ahead in the counselling session too.
206 - 08 Dec 2023 01:16PM - +263 77 776 6715: Ok sir
207 - 08 Dec 2023 01:20PM - Gurvinder: Samathar, by now, I hope you have understood that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is not merely a platform for students to gain admission to an internationally recognized university. It offers much more. Among various differentiators, the value provided by Edoofa to a particular student surpasses that offered by any admission agent or consultant.
206 - 08 Dec 2023 01:16PM - +263 77 776 6715: Ok sir

209 - 08 Dec 2023 01:23PM - Gurvinder: Alright Samathar, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
210 - 08 Dec 2023 01:25PM - +263 77 776 6715: I believe so
211 - 08 Dec 2023 01:55PM - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
212 - 08 Dec 2023 02:47PM - +263 77 776 6715: I have sir
213 - 08 Dec 2023 02:56PM - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.  Are you ready?
214 - 08 Dec 2023 02:56PM - +263 77 776 6715: Yes i am ready
215 - 08 Dec 2023 03:04PM - Gurvinder: Samathar, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*",No,Yes

90 - 08 Dec 2023 01:08PM - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
91 - 08 Dec 2023 01:13PM - +263 77 706 9620: I want to study abroad because I believe it will provide me with an opportunity to learn about other cultures, experience different perspectives, and broaden my horizons.

Additionally, I believe that studying abroad will challenge me in new ways and help me grow as a person.  I'm excited about the opportunity to learn and grow in a different environment. Yes, you could also mention something about the advantages of studying optometry in a different country.  Studying optometry in a different country will give me the opportunity to learn from different optometrists and gain exposure to different technologies and techniques.  This will help me become a more well-rounded optometrist and give me a competitive edge in the field.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
93 - 08 Dec 2023 01:20PM - +263 77 706 9620: If given the opportunity to study abroad, I would be honored to take what I learn and apply it to my own country's education system.  I want to help improve the quality of education in my country by bringing back new ideas and approaches that I learn while studying abroad.  I believe that by doing so, I can make a positive impact on the lives of future generations of students in my country.
94 - 08 Dec 2023 01:22PM - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Seline, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you.  Don’t you agree?
95 - 08 Dec 2023 01:31PM - +263 77 706 9620: I believe that the environment in which we study plays a crucial role in shaping our success and ability to have a positive impact on the world around us.  A supportive and encouraging environment is necessary to foster creativity, innovation, and drive.  It's not enough to simply have access to education - it must be accompanied by an environment that allows students to flourish and reach their full potential.  I think that the two go hand-in-hand, and without both, it would be difficult to achieve true success.Yes I agree which is why I would be honoured to be part of your program which provides necessary knowledge and skills to become a successful optometrist and I believe that'll be a conducive environment for me

97 - 08 Dec 2023 01:58PM - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

98 - 08 Dec 2023 02:09PM - +263 77 706 9620: Yes
99 - 08 Dec 2023 02:22PM - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
22 - 08 Dec 2023 12:42PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
23 - 08 Dec 2023 12:42PM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.

24 - 08 Dec 2023 12:42PM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
25 - 08 Dec 2023 04:53PM - +263 78 014 8716: That's correct
26 - 08 Dec 2023 07:03PM - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.  Have a good day ahead. God Bless You!

By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.  I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?

165 - 08 Dec 2023 09:33AM - Gurvinder: Shamiso, by now, I hope you have understood that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is not merely a platform for students to gain admission to an internationally recognized university. It offers much more. Among various differentiators, the value provided by Edoofa to a particular student surpasses that offered by any admission agent or consultant.
166 - 08 Dec 2023 09:39AM - +263 78 883 0814: Yes l have understood sir
167 - 08 Dec 2023 10:13AM - Gurvinder: Alright Shamiso, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.

171 - 08 Dec 2023 10:56AM - Gurvinder: Shamiso as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
164 - 08 Dec 2023 07:48AM - +263 78 883 0814: Okay sir

173 - 08 Dec 2023 12:04PM - Gurvinder: Exactly Shamiso, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.

177 - 08 Dec 2023 12:40PM - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students.  Don’t you think so?

179 - 08 Dec 2023 01:02PM - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
180 - 08 Dec 2023 01:03PM - Gurvinder: Shamiso basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation  If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.  *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).  *Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.  *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
181 - 08 Dec 2023 01:03PM - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
178 - 08 Dec 2023 12:53PM - +263 78 883 0814: Yes

183 - 08 Dec 2023 01:58PM - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.  Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
184 - 08 Dec 2023 01:59PM - +263 78 883 0814: No l'm not
185 - 08 Dec 2023 02:12PM - Gurvinder: Let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
186 - 08 Dec 2023 02:12PM - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
187 - 08 Dec 2023 02:13PM - Gurvinder: Alright Shamiso, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.  Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself. <This message was edited>",No,Yes

Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!

Many such graduates secure jobs as researchers working in universities, pharmaceutical and bioscience companies and institutes.  Successful graduates of the course also progress into laboratory-based careers in clinical or technical roles which do not involve research. The transferable skills one develops also equip one well for a wide range of careers outside the lab.  There are several job opportunities for those who want to pursue a career in microbiology. Microbiologists can find job opportunities in sectors such as government and private hospitals, food industries, research and development organizations, chemical industries and pharmaceutical industries.
75 - 07 Dec 2023 03:43PM - Gurvinder: They can also choose a career as science writer, writing articles for professional microbiologists.  *Some of the popular professional avenues open to such graduates are:* *Bacteriologist* A Bacteriologist is responsible for studying various kinds of bacteria, which are constantly changing and evolving. They typically perform research in a laboratory, mostly for government or pharmaceutical agencies.  *Virologist* A Virologist is a professional who studies the growth, development, structure and characteristics of different viruses. He isolates and makes cultures of significant viruses in a standard inhibitory medium, controlling certain factors, like, aeration, moisture, temperature, and nutrition.  *Mycologist* A Mycologist is a scientist who studies fungi that is known to be an independent organism similar to animals, algae, plants and bacteria. Mycologists study operations of organism- based processes of poisonous, edible and parasitic fungi in order to discover organisms useful in medicine, industry and agriculture.  *Cell biologist* Cell biologists research and study the properties, interactions and structure of cellular molecules from which they can extrapolate basic principles or generalizations about the effects of cell behaviour on an organism. For example, looking at how certain cell behaviours contribute to the progression of cancer in the body.  *Biochemist* Biochemists work with the chemical composition of living organisms and perform studies of the chemical processes involved in all basic life functions. Through research, experimentation and study, these professionals provide us with much of the background knowledge on topics like genetics and heredity.

208 - 08 Dec 2023 11:36AM - Harmehak: Mr. Michael, What is the country finalized for your child's higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship?
209 - 08 Dec 2023 11:37AM - +27 78 040 2691: India
210 - 08 Dec 2023 11:37AM - Harmehak: Very correct!  So far do you have any queries for me?
211 - 08 Dec 2023 11:37AM - +27 78 040 2691: No
212 - 08 Dec 2023 11:54AM - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.  I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
213 - 08 Dec 2023 11:54AM - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-  1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.  2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program.  Or  A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
214 - 08 Dec 2023 11:54AM - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India  I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
215 - 08 Dec 2023 11:54AM - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
216 - 08 Dec 2023 12:01PM - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates: 1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 14th  or 15th December 2023 for $200 and the  14th  or 15th of January for the remaining $150. 2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 14th  or 15th December 2023.  Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?",No,No

34 - 08 Dec 2023 09:07AM - Harmehak: Perfect, I can see you got to know about the program from your friend Nostalgia!  So now can you please tell me, what is your understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and what all did you happen to learn from your friend?
35 - 08 Dec 2023 09:14AM - +263 71 483 0935: It is a program that cater for students who are hardworking and are willing to progress with their education and development to a greater level at low costs
80 - 08 Dec 2023 11:33AM - Harmehak: Perfect, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.  *1. Scholarships* *2. Sponsorships*  Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.  Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
81 - 08 Dec 2023 11:36AM - +263 71 483 0935: So do you provide both the programs
82 - 08 Dec 2023 11:37AM - Harmehak: Edoofa is a scholarship program please.
83 - 08 Dec 2023 11:39AM - +263 71 483 0935: Okay
84 - 08 Dec 2023 11:39AM - +263 71 483 0935: So what's the average cost of living as a student in India while u are a foreigner
85 - 08 Dec 2023 11:57AM - Harmehak: I would discuss everything in detail.
86 - 08 Dec 2023 11:57AM - Harmehak: Perfect, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,  While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time.  This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year.  Wouldn't you agree to the same?
87 - 08 Dec 2023 12:53PM - Harmehak: Are we connected?
88 - 08 Dec 2023 02:33PM - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, however, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as I would be heading for an urgent board meeting, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.  *Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*",No,No

179 - 08 Dec 2023 08:13PM - Kunal: Let me help you understand <This message was edited>
180 - 08 Dec 2023 08:14PM - Kunal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation  If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.  Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).  Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.  The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
181 - 08 Dec 2023 08:14PM - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes Anele's  -Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team -Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities -Earn While You Learn Program and training -University sessions and interactions -A guaranteed scholarship seat -Visa Documentation Assistance The Foster and Care throughout your course
182 - 08 Dec 2023 08:14PM - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*

140 - 08 Dec 2023 06:35PM - Kunal: Indeed If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  *NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.

75 - 08 Dec 2023 04:40PM - +263 77 109 9889: According to the document the fees is 6 000 to 8000 dollars per year.Tution fee 50-100 percent or 2 000-3 000dollas per year after scholarship as for the Visa the student pays for herself and also pays for transport with the help of Edoofa.
76 - 08 Dec 2023 05:04PM - Kunal: That is right So, are you comfortable with the aspects to proceed ahead?
77 - 08 Dec 2023 05:37PM - +263 77 109 9889: Sorry we can't afford it
78 - 08 Dec 2023 05:51PM - Kunal: I understand So, how are you planning to support Kudakwashe ahead for higher education?
79 - 08 Dec 2023 05:54PM - +263 77 109 9889: She will attend a local university which I will afford to pay.
80 - 08 Dec 2023 05:58PM - Kunal: Are you aware of the cost of education at your local university?
84 - 08 Dec 2023 06:50PM - +263 77 109 9889: No passport no Visa no plane ticket therefore it's less expensive
85 - 08 Dec 2023 07:00PM - Kunal: I see the student is spending more than 2200 USD while studying in Zimbabwe, now through the Edoofa program the cost is much lower and there are specific courses such as BBA etc, where a child can even receive a higher quantum of scholarship.
86 - 08 Dec 2023 07:00PM - Kunal: Let me also tell you that our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months this year and Let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1200-$1500 per annum with nearly 20% or more hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum. At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program!

88 - 08 Dec 2023 07:16PM - +263 77 109 9889: What about WiFi in India isn't it expensive

95 - 08 Dec 2023 07:44PM - +263 77 585 5103: I am glad that India can let students choose from a wide range of  courses which shows that it considers student's choice The fact that there are a variety of cultural activities is an important part in that they get to choose . It will be beneficial for my child tin that she will be provided with quality guidance and academic growth as well as practical skills
96 - 08 Dec 2023 08:07PM - Kunal: Indeed, I believe your child would learn a lot from the exposures offered if found eligible and works hard to achieve the dreams. Moving ahead, by any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?

Let me know once you are available!
99 - 08 Dec 2023 07:46PM - Kunal: That's completely understandable, So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.  So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
100 - 08 Dec 2023 07:48PM - +263 77 636 1519: They are comfortable with me learning abroad they dont have a problem
101 - 08 Dec 2023 07:48PM - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at even a greater pace, as you will be transformed to a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family thereby yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle free life to your parents.
102 - 08 Dec 2023 07:48PM - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be  1) Application Form  2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.  3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
103 - 08 Dec 2023 07:50PM - +263 77 636 1519: I think thats all and a clearance letter from the Ministry of Higher and tertiary education
104 - 08 Dec 2023 08:07PM - Kunal: Indeed *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.  Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
105 - 08 Dec 2023 08:07PM - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.  So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.

107 - 08 Dec 2023 08:09PM - +263 77 636 1519: Thats great then
108 - 08 Dec 2023 08:10PM - Kunal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation  If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.  Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).  Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.  The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.",No,Yes

168 - 08 Dec 2023 06:08PM - Kunal: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
169 - 08 Dec 2023 06:08PM - Kunal: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
170 - 08 Dec 2023 06:08PM - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.  I hope you are clear with the process.
171 - 08 Dec 2023 06:11PM - +263 77 221 3657: Clear
172 - 08 Dec 2023 06:51PM - Kunal: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check. I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
173 - 08 Dec 2023 06:51PM - Kunal: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*  *2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*  *3. Also, the financial aspects involved*  *4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*
174 - 08 Dec 2023 06:52PM - Kunal: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experience  Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com  Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many. With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process. This reduced cost includes: *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*

105 - 08 Dec 2023 12:50PM - +263 78 302 9317: No as a family we can not afford
106 - 08 Dec 2023 12:51PM - Kunal: I can understand So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further. And do you know how that is done?
107 - 08 Dec 2023 12:52PM - +263 78 302 9317: By that way
108 - 08 Dec 2023 01:08PM - Kunal: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the  *Earn While You Learn Program*  The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
109 - 08 Dec 2023 01:08PM - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.   The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
110 - 08 Dec 2023 01:08PM - Kunal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
111 - 08 Dec 2023 01:08PM - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -* The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are: Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0 Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
112 - 08 Dec 2023 01:08PM - Kunal: *Recruitment Partners: -* Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program.

But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*    Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
136 - 08 Dec 2023 08:43AM - Pallika Edoofa: As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?

135 - 08 Dec 2023 08:42AM - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, Mr. Farai, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*    Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship.

(The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

325 - 08 Dec 2023 11:08AM - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning How are you doing today?
326 - 08 Dec 2023 01:30PM - +263 77 979 3491: We are all fine thank you
327 - 08 Dec 2023 01:30PM - +263 77 979 3491: <Media omitted>
328 - 08 Dec 2023 02:16PM - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.  I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
329 - 08 Dec 2023 02:16PM - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-  1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.  2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program.  Or  A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
330 - 08 Dec 2023 02:16PM - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India  I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.

332 - 08 Dec 2023 02:17PM - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates: 1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 14th  or 15th December 2023 for $200 and the 14th  or 15th of January  for the remaining $150. 2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 14th  or 15th December 2023. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?

Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.  2.     *Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
211 - 06 Dec 2023 03:23PM - Sahil Edoofa: 3.     *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.   4.     *Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education. --  So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
212 - 06 Dec 2023 04:03PM - +263 78 143 5949: I prefer employability through practical training, because will be applying what are learning,  in a real life situation which happens to be maybe difficult but will make it easier for us in the long run

227 - 08 Dec 2023 12:16PM - +263 78 081 5279: Yes I want to know more about the payment mode
228 - 08 Dec 2023 12:18PM - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.  So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
229 - 08 Dec 2023 12:18PM - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-  BANK NAME: FBC  SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA  ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA  ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828  CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854

367 - 07 Dec 2023 02:21PM - Sahil Edoofa: you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $35 to $50 which is quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zambia itself. Due to this not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $35 to $50 just as transfer charge.  The second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in our associate Mr. Hammond and Mrs. Penelope's organization Penmal Connect's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 5% at the end.  So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Penmal Connect's account as you see he is our Associate in Zambia, His contribution has been immense because of which students like Muchimba are able to pursue their education in India.  The fee payment can also be made through them. Since they have two accounts one is a USD account and the other is the Zambian Kwacha Account, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $368 ($350 + $18 transfer charges) or equivalent Zambian Kwacha, and the same details are as below:-  US Dollar Account Bank Name: FNB Branch: Acacia Branch Account Name: Penmal Connect Ltd Account Number: 62878003806 Swift Code: FIRNZMLX Sort Code: 2600001 Contact Number: +260972651616, +260978789429 Address: 8 Chibote Avenue, Parklands, Kitwe, Copperbelt Province, Zambia  Zambian Kwacha Account Bank Name: FNB Branch: Acacia Branch Account Name: Penmal Connect Ltd Account Number: 62878003731 Swift Code: FIRNZMLX Sort Code: 2600001 Contact Number: +260972651616, +260978789429 Address: 8 Chibote Avenue, Parklands, Kitwe, Copperbelt Province, Zambia

214 - 08 Dec 2023 04:38PM - Sahil Edoofa: let me share with you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly .  In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc.It is still beyond the reach of many. So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process. This cost includes: *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,gym,Laundry,etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*

325 - 08 Dec 2023 03:08PM - Sahil Edoofa: Michelle's admission is for August 2025 Intake. Let me share with you for all the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake. Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways  *1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:-* Having a head start that too of more than 20 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.  Giving you an example, *Persistance Muza* the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself.  This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.  *2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:-* Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels.  *3,  Having the benefit of the Community:-* This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.

432 - 08 Dec 2023 02:12PM - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.  So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
433 - 08 Dec 2023 02:12PM - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-  BANK NAME: FBC  SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA  ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA  ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828  CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854

334 - 08 Dec 2023 02:20PM - Sahil Edoofa: you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $35 to $50 which is quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zambia itself. Due to this not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $35 to $50 just as transfer charge.  The second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in our associate Mr. Hammond and Mrs. Penelope's organization Penmal Connect's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 5% at the end.  So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Penmal Connect's account as you see he is our Associate in Zambia, His contribution has been immense because of which students like Muchimba are able to pursue their education in India.  The fee payment can also be made through them. Since they have two accounts one is a USD account and the other is the Zambian Kwacha Account, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $368 ($350 + $18 transfer charges) or equivalent Zambian Kwacha, and the same details are as below:-  US Dollar Account Bank Name: FNB Branch: Acacia Branch Account Name: Penmal Connect Ltd Account Number: 62878003806 Swift Code: FIRNZMLX Sort Code: 2600001 Contact Number: +260972651616, +260978789429 Address: 8 Chibote Avenue, Parklands, Kitwe, Copperbelt Province, Zambia  Zambian Kwacha Account Bank Name: FNB Branch: Acacia Branch Account Name: Penmal Connect Ltd Account Number: 62878003731 Swift Code: FIRNZMLX Sort Code: 2600001 Contact Number: +260972651616, +260978789429 Address: 8 Chibote Avenue, Parklands, Kitwe, Copperbelt Province, Zambia

431 - 08 Dec 2023 03:15PM - +263 77 280 2690: *My Assessment of Edoofa*  There is absolutely no doubt now that your organisation is legit and assists a lot of students to access affordable tertiary education and I commend you for that.You are really bridging an important gap and making university education affordable especially for students coming from troubled economies like ours. My assessment on the whole recruitment process that we recently underwent is...Please kindly tone it down on over referring us to local people.Whilst it is a noble initiative I found it overbearing to a large extent. The reason I slowed down on initiating my payment was when I received a local call from a local woman whom you referred to talk to me about depositing money into your account.I raised my concerns about such 'red flags' typically used by some scammers who use such modus operandi where they connive with local accomplices to convince. 2)While appreciating the effort to assist us in avoiding exorbitant bank transfer charges.I also found it as a 'red flag' your referring us to deposit funds in a someone's personal Nostro Account domiciled here.Nomatter how authentic he may be..for some people like us who have been victims of scams before..it triggers wrong signals. 3)Finally would appreciate if you could send me a list of the Universities that you recruit on behalf of so that I make an informed decision based on their location,quality and rankings.  Otherwise apart from my above comments,I have no doubt that you guys are legit and have assisted lots of people.These are my humble submissions
432 - 08 Dec 2023 03:26PM - Sahil Edoofa: We acknowledge that not everyone has access to international bank accounts, and our intention in providing local payment options is to facilitate a smoother process for those facing such constraints.
433 - 08 Dec 2023 03:27PM - Sahil Edoofa: In response to your concerns:  Referring to Local Contacts: The reason behind connecting you with local individuals, such as Mr. Charles, a retired education officer, is to offer trustworthy options for payment. We understand the sensitivity around financial transactions, especially in the context of past scams. However, please be assured that these individuals are trusted associates, often with affiliations to reputable schools, and are part of our effort to make the payment process more accessible.

Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!  *Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.  We are left with 5 and 6.

248 - 08 Dec 2023 01:14PM - Sahil Edoofa: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.  *August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*  This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.  Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.  I hope you are clear with the process?

251 - 08 Dec 2023 09:48PM - Sahil Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-  *1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*  *2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*  *3.

248 - 08 Dec 2023 01:14PM - Sahil Edoofa: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.  *August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*  This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.  Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.  I hope you are clear with the process?

172 - 08 Dec 2023 01:55PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month
173 - 08 Dec 2023 01:55PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._  Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
167 - 08 Dec 2023 11:02AM - +27 65 301 0118: Good morning sir

174 - 08 Dec 2023 01:55PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.  Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
175 - 08 Dec 2023 01:55PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.  In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.  A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

197 - 08 Dec 2023 04:57PM - +27 65 301 0118: Yes .I can now realize how Piet can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on us
198 - 08 Dec 2023 04:58PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!  Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.  2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
199 - 08 Dec 2023 04:58PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.  4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.

I took a gap year in 2023 to find out the program that I could be in to make a huge impact by bringing out my potential. So during that gap year I would read some books and take online courses that took a short time to complete. Moreover go to more workshops.. I got more involved in the church in singing and organising events . I have been advocating for the girl child in ending child marriages. My main achievement on this one was creating a petition for Memory Machaya which later on got recognised by the UN and there are still some changes to be made so I am working on it by using my social media to research and use it as an advantage to reach out to people about this so that we can change the system together at large <This message was edited>

Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.  Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
168 - 08 Dec 2023 03:07PM - +263 71 433 2297: You can advise
169 - 08 Dec 2023 03:29PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Mrs. Runyararo! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.  In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many. So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process. This cost includes: 1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any) 2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.) 3. Food 4. Accommodation

It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

So do you want me to guide you about the *Earn while you learn* program in depth?
139 - 08 Dec 2023 02:12PM - +263 77 678 6824: Yes sir that will be good for me
142 - 08 Dec 2023 02:27PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: - The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are: Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0 Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
143 - 08 Dec 2023 02:27PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: - Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:- Nigenuis Skooqs Success Magazine TIA Organics
144 - 08 Dec 2023 02:27PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: - We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: - Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade. How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
145 - 08 Dec 2023 02:27PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.  These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.  What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
146 - 08 Dec 2023 02:40PM - +263 77 678 6824: This is very nice and it will be a benefit to me sir I will be happy if l study at the same time getting experience in the working process.
147 - 08 Dec 2023 03:21PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1600 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $400 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $40-$60 a month
148 - 08 Dec 2023 03:21PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._  Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
149 - 08 Dec 2023 03:21PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $1600, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $800 in the first semester and $800 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.  Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
150 - 08 Dec 2023 03:21PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.  In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.  A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

172 - 08 Dec 2023 03:33PM - +263 77 678 6824: I wanted to be one of the best  if l get the chance to study in India also I can't wait to be one of them .
173 - 08 Dec 2023 03:43PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!  Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.  2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
174 - 08 Dec 2023 03:43PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.  4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
175 - 08 Dec 2023 03:43PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
176 - 08 Dec 2023 03:52PM - +263 77 678 6824: Point number 3 is the one which l mostly appreciate since it helps in many ways

Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.

182 - 08 Dec 2023 06:58PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be  1) *Application Form*  2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.  3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
183 - 08 Dec 2023 07:08PM - +263 77 678 6824: That's very true sir . Those are the most important stages taken in the process of applying to study at any university.
184 - 08 Dec 2023 07:13PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.  Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not* And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
195 - 08 Dec 2023 07:49PM - +263 77 678 6824: Is the enrollment fee paid now or later after l receive the acceptance letter.
196 - 08 Dec 2023 07:51PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Nesbert. If you are found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship and receive the Acceptance Letter from The Academic Board, then only you have to commence the financial process, please.
197 - 08 Dec 2023 07:51PM - +263 77 678 6824: Oky sir I get you

199 - 08 Dec 2023 08:04PM - +263 77 678 6824: We were on the stage number 1 and and number 2
200 - 08 Dec 2023 08:21PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, we are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.  *Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.  *Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.  *Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!  *Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.  We are left with 5 and 6. So shall I explain it to you?
201 - 08 Dec 2023 08:29PM - +263 77 678 6824: Yes sir you can but I think that the stage when you give the statement which acknowledge the the truth and benefits of the Edoofa scholarship
202 - 08 Dec 2023 08:47PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.  This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).  Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$1000) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.  I hope you are clear with the process?

204 - 08 Dec 2023 09:04PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.  Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

140 - 08 Dec 2023 12:14PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Ruvarashe. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
141 - 08 Dec 2023 12:14PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.  The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

143 - 08 Dec 2023 12:14PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: - Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion.

Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:- Nigenuis Skooqs Success Magazine TIA Organics
144 - 08 Dec 2023 12:14PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: - We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.

145 - 08 Dec 2023 12:14PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.  These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.  What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
146 - 08 Dec 2023 09:30PM - +263 71 359 6160: I think the EWYL program will be beneficial for me

157 - 08 Dec 2023 11:59AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $140-$160 a month
158 - 08 Dec 2023 11:59AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._  Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
159 - 08 Dec 2023 12:00PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $3000, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1500 in the first semester and $1500 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.  Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
160 - 08 Dec 2023 12:00PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.  In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.  A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

183 - 08 Dec 2023 12:42PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!  Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.  2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
184 - 08 Dec 2023 12:42PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.  4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.

193 - 08 Dec 2023 04:10PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be  1) *Application Form*  2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.  3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
194 - 08 Dec 2023 04:12PM - +263 71 808 3483: I only know about the application form and letter of recommendation, Can you explain more about the others?",No,Yes

Furthermore I don't only wish to be a lawyer but l aspire to lead the court room as further as a Magistrate. I aspire to motivate other women through my career so that gender equality is promoted so that women can also be able to achieve their goals besides their status. I basically believe that in the event of achieving my goals and career, l am going to motivate more women and young people to fulfill their goals and dreams. Not only do l do this for motivating other people but to enjoy what l love doing and to fulfill my dreams as l believe it is my calling.

This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

113 - 08 Dec 2023 10:43AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Tanaka! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.  In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many. So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process. This cost includes: 1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any) 2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.) 3. Food 4. Accommodation

127 - 08 Dec 2023 03:45PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Now considering that your home country is Zimbabwe. The average tuition fees of a decent university in Zimbabwe is 1200-1500$ a year which roughly means 750$ per term. On top of that the cost of food averages around 1$ per meal. Plus the miscellaneous charges including internet and accommodation are around 2000-2500$ per annum. Therefore, resulting in 3000-4000$ a year. Will you be able to afford this type of education which barely leads to employment? Many of our students who are already in India with us have mentioned that students who are studying in Zimbabwe are barely getting any jobs after completing their respective courses.  Will you be content with the fact that you are spending money and time on a degree like that?
128 - 08 Dec 2023 03:46PM - +263 77 549 9556: No l want to come study in lndia with ur help sir
129 - 08 Dec 2023 03:49PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tanaka. You will be glad to know that we have familiarized ourselves with the economic condition of African nations and we offer something special and extremely valuable to our *Edoofians*. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.  Sounds impressive? Do you have any idea how that's done?
130 - 08 Dec 2023 03:50PM - +263 77 549 9556: No l have no idea Sir
131 - 08 Dec 2023 03:50PM - +263 77 549 9556: Sir can l ask do l have a scholarship know or not yet

169 - 08 Dec 2023 04:29PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how you can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on your parents?
170 - 08 Dec 2023 04:36PM - +263 77 549 9556: Yaaa l understand it
171 - 08 Dec 2023 04:54PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!  Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.  2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
172 - 08 Dec 2023 04:55PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.  4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
173 - 08 Dec 2023 04:55PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
174 - 08 Dec 2023 05:02PM - +263 77 549 9556: Number 3
175 - 08 Dec 2023 05:03PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand that your emphasis is on affordability and employability. So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
176 - 08 Dec 2023 05:04PM - +263 77 549 9556: Yes they want me to go study abroad and they are good with it
177 - 08 Dec 2023 05:05PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
178 - 08 Dec 2023 05:05PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be  1) *Application Form*  2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.  3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
179 - 08 Dec 2023 05:10PM - +263 77 549 9556: A passport , national id to these are required
180 - 08 Dec 2023 05:10PM - +263 77 549 9556: And also the once u listed
181 - 08 Dec 2023 06:51PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Correct! Moving on, *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.  Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not* And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
182 - 08 Dec 2023 06:51PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
183 - 08 Dec 2023 06:52PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
184 - 08 Dec 2023 06:52PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your  - *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team* - *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities* - *Earn While You Learn Program and training* - *University sessions and interactions* - *A guaranteed scholarship seat* - *Visa Documentation Assistance* - *The Foster and Care throughout your course*

You must have gone through the counselling session so far along with your family members  So shall we continue with your process?

101 - 08 Dec 2023 02:58PM - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time,  However, as your concierge, I would like to share with you that the career path which you have chosen ahead, will require a lot of hard work and dedication.  So are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career?
102 - 08 Dec 2023 02:59PM - +263 71 371 5731: Yes, I'm more than willing
103 - 08 Dec 2023 03:02PM - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it

4 - 08 Dec 2023 01:12PM - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
5 - 08 Dec 2023 01:25PM - +260 97 7773007: Alright thanks, that is wounderful and great , what are the qualifications for the best deserving student to be at your institution for scholarship ?
6 - 08 Dec 2023 01:40PM - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.  Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.
7 - 08 Dec 2023 01:52PM - +260 97 7773007: Alright I've understood,if a student for example have been offered scholarship at your school do you provide food and accommodation

2 - 08 Dec 2023 12:04PM - Shubham Madhwal: Greetings Getrude and Ms Sharon!  I am Mr Shubham, The Senior Acadmecian at Edoofa.  I am here to discuss the application of Getrude  Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session  Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program

4 - 08 Dec 2023 12:24PM - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
5 - 08 Dec 2023 12:24PM - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.  Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.

179 - 08 Dec 2023 01:15PM - Shubham Madhwal: Let me explain why Edoofa recommends India as a destination for higher study. You see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:  1. *Robust Education System:* India boasts the world's third-largest education system, comprising 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges. This extensive infrastructure provides students with a diverse range of educational opportunities.  2. *Renowned Institutions:* India is home to highly rated institutions known for their academic excellence and quality of education. Students can choose from a wide range of disciplines, including politics, philosophy, engineering, medical sciences, biology, business, and media/journalism.  3. *Quality Education and Research:* Indian universities emphasize a rigorous academic curriculum that combines theoretical knowledge with practical skill development. Students have opportunities for cutting-edge research projects and collaboration with experts.  4. *Faculty Expertise:* The faculty members in Indian institutions are highly qualified and bring industry expertise to the classroom. They provide quality instruction, mentorship, and guidance to nurture students' academic and professional growth.  5. *Global Recognition and Career Prospects:* Indian degrees are globally recognized, opening doors to a wide range of career opportunities worldwide. Graduates from Indian institutions have achieved success in various fields globally.  6. *Cultural Diversity and Vibrant Campus Life:* India's educational institutions celebrate cultural diversity, providing students with a multicultural environment. Additionally, students can engage in vibrant campus life, participate in cultural festivals, and experience the rich heritage of India.  7. *Affordability and Scholarships:* Studying in India is more affordable compared to many renowned institutions worldwide. The cost of education is lower, and various scholarships, loans, and financial assistance programs are available to support students.  8. *English Medium of Instruction:* English is widely used as a medium of instruction in Indian universities, ensuring a comfortable learning experience for international students.  9. *Research and Innovation Opportunities:* Indian institutions offer opportunities for students to engage in cutting-edge research and innovation. They can collaborate with experts, contribute to advancements in their fields, and develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.  Let me also show you some facts about India and several global leaders who are Indian graduates.

If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.  1. The title that best suits the passage would be: a) The Change of Nature b) The Will to Fight c) Courage and Panic d) The Miracle of Confronting Danger  2.A man may react to sudden danger in three different ways . What are they? a) He may be paralyzed with fear, run away or fight. b) He may flee in panic, or fight back or stand still. c) He may be paralyzed with fear, or seized with panic, or as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, and face the danger. d) He may be paralyzed with fear, seized with panic or act like an inferior animal.  3.What is the meaning of the word debilitating ? a) enfeeble b) thriving c) strengthen d) debase  4. Explain the phrase ‘gather resolution from danger’. a) Find peace in times of difficulty. b) To remain calm and not to lose hope. c) A state of utter hopelessness makes one determined to face the difficulty. d) To be enthusiastic and brave the odds.  5. The author feels happy in the recollection of dangers faced and overcome because a) He felt elated as he was alive. b) They added a new perspective and lifted him above himself for a time. c) They brought him a new experience. d) These experiences boosted his confidence.  SECTION 3 LANGUAGE TEST  Each passage below is accompanied by a number of questions. For some questions, you will consider how the passage might be revised to improve the expression of ideas. For other questions, you will consider how the passage might be edited to correct errors in sentence structure, usage, or punctuation. A passage or a question may be accompanied by one or more graphics (such as a table or graph) that you will consider as you make revising and editing decisions. Some questions will direct you to an underlined portion of a passage. Other questions will direct you to a location in a passage or ask you to think about the passage as a whole. After reading each passage, choose the answer to each question that most effectively improves the quality of writing in the passage or that makes the passage conform to the conventions of standard written English. Many questions include a “NO CHANGE” option. Choose that option if you think the best choice is to leave the relevant portion of the passage as it is.  Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.  6. outdo A) NO CHANGE B) defeat C) outperform D) outweigh  7.can pollute waterways A) NO CHANGE B) can pollute waterways, C) could have polluted waterways, D) has polluted waterway’s,  8.scientists; and A) NO CHANGE B) scientists: and C) scientists, and D) scientists, and,  9.To make this paragraph most logical, Sentence 5 should be placed A) where it is now.

B) 2  SECTION 5  I think it is safe to say the trauma of a genocide stays with the affected population for a long, long time, and I also agree  that 16 years after the genocide, the Rwandan society and Rwanda have changed so much. In Today’s Rwanda, there is no room for segregation and divisionism. There is absolutely zero tolerance with regards to genocide ideology, Rwanda has achieved more than many people envisioned in the past 16 years From having the cleanest capital city in Africa, to being one of the least corrupted countries in Africa, being one of the most well-organized government in Africa, a champion of gender equality and a paradise for women, and many more.Rwanda has gone from being a “ failed state” to what many have called an “ economic miracle”.It has not been a smooth ride, but despite the challenges, Rwanda has continued to push through, overcoming danger and adversity along the way. 16 years after genocide, Rwanda is a peaceful, developing country, with the ambition to change the course of its history for the better. According to the World Economic Forum, Rwanda is among the top 20 safest nations in the world.The key reason for Rwandan success ( after 1994 genocide) is attributed to promoting gender equality. Giving men and women equal opportunity to acquire skills and knowledge.

Rwanda has made significant progress in stabilizing and rehabilitating its economy.  SECTION 6 ""My Inspirational story""  piration: Higher Education and South Western Community This is my first time posting my essay on here but i need help please. I have never written a narrative essay so i need to know if this is what it is supposed to look like?  My Inspiration  My father taught me lots of lessons in life since I was young, but the one that stood above them all was the subject of education. He always told me that if I wanted to be successful, I would have to go to university and make something out of myself. My family is not a wealthy family. Therefore, my dad saved every single penny he earned from work to buy anything that I needed. He always encouraged me, because he knew that the value of an education will determine a future for me. As a result, I admired him. My dad had a huge impact on how I am today. He has influenced my life by teaching me lessons and showing me the rights and wrongs. My dad taught me the most important lesson: how to be an independent male. I still remember the day that my father sat next to me and said, ""Hey buddy"", the most important thing to help you become successful is to have an education, it won’t be a walk in the park dude, but in the end it will be more then worth it. Of course, I already knew he was going to say that, for it was nothing new.  My father was a very smart man. He did not finish high school for he had my brother and had to drop out to work. He then had my sister and eight years later my mother and my father had me! My sister only accomplished one year of  high as for my brother, the straight A student, finished with our dad’s support and became an electrician. My dad always reminded me of how my sister and my brother’s life style were different. He thought (and might be right) that they have different life styles because my brother had a higher education was now satisfied and happy; unlike my sister whom wasn't ’t as happy and satisfied with her. The reflected appraisal that he made clear to me before he passed away, almost 7 years ago, was that I needed to further my education and finally do something with my life. he always told me that I was a lot smarter than I let people see. My father didn't let an opportunity pass to teach his children. My dad has taught me lots of things there is to know about many different subjects. Because of him I have learned to change tires on a car, because of him I have learned how to respect my siblings, because of him I have learned to cherish the moments in everyday life, because of him I have learned to have more confidence in myself. He was really a role model. Rest easy, man.",No,Yes

After that, we will connect you with the universities to clear all your doubts and also if the university has any questions for you.  We have experience working with over 250+ universities and with that experience, you will have a proper admission expert assisting you with your admission. Edoofa's academic team will help the students to have university sessions to enable them to get admission via our scholarship fund. (This process also happens while the students remain in their home country and they receive letters from the University directly).  Once the university sessions are over, students will secure the Admission offer letter (LOI) from the respective universities based on Edoofa's recommendation at the end you will be given multiple admission offer letters from the top universities which are applicable for your course and hence you will have the freedom to choose the university in which you will pursue your higher education.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. <This message was edited>

After that, we will connect you with the universities to clear all your doubts and also if the university has any questions for you.  We have experience working with over 250+ universities and with that experience, you will have a proper admission expert assisting you with your admission. Edoofa's academic team will help the students to have university sessions to enable them to get admission via our scholarship fund. (This process also happens while the students remain in their home country and they receive letters from the University directly).  Once the university sessions are over, students will secure the Admission offer letter (LOI) from the respective universities based on Edoofa's recommendation at the end you will be given multiple admission offer letters from the top universities which are applicable for your course and hence you will have the freedom to choose the university in which you will pursue your higher education.

Now that you are aware, That is why we recommend India for your higher education, Can you explain why you want to study abroad and not in your native country?
163 - 08 Dec 2023 12:41PM - +263 71 543 8646: It's because I would get an opportunity to get job after studying my course as compared to my country, I can get an opportunity to work outside the country as I compared with my country since there is high rate of unemployment. I want to create relationship and friendship with different people,I also want to improve my English command as I would socialise with different people with different languages. The other reason is education level ,we are now used to learn our native things so I would like to change that system . It also give me an opportunity to experience some new cultures and learn about the ways of life. It provide the chance to improve language skills and endede up building strong communication with different people.  Studying abroad gives me a great chance to experience the standard of living . Studying abroad lead to personal growth and developments ,as it often requires students to step outside of their comfort zone and learn to adapt to a new environment. Lastly to travel and explore a new  part of world.

Now that you are aware, That is why we recommend India for your higher education, Can you explain why you want to study abroad and not in your native country?
163 - 08 Dec 2023 12:41PM - +263 71 543 8646: It's because I would get an opportunity to get job after studying my course as compared to my country, I can get an opportunity to work outside the country as I compared with my country since there is high rate of unemployment. I want to create relationship and friendship with different people,I also want to improve my English command as I would socialise with different people with different languages. The other reason is education level ,we are now used to learn our native things so I would like to change that system . It also give me an opportunity to experience some new cultures and learn about the ways of life. It provide the chance to improve language skills and endede up building strong communication with different people.  Studying abroad gives me a great chance to experience the standard of living . Studying abroad lead to personal growth and developments ,as it often requires students to step outside of their comfort zone and learn to adapt to a new environment. Lastly to travel and explore a new  part of world.
164 - 08 Dec 2023 01:15PM - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?

Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many.

If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.  1. The title that best suits the passage would be: a) The Change of Nature b) The Will to Fight c) Courage and Panic d) The Miracle of Confronting Danger  2.A man may react to sudden danger in three different ways . What are they? a) He may be paralyzed with fear, run away or fight. b) He may flee in panic, or fight back or stand still. c) He may be paralyzed with fear, or seized with panic, or as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, and face the danger. d) He may be paralyzed with fear, seized with panic or act like an inferior animal.  3.What is the meaning of the word debilitating ? a) enfeeble b) thriving c) strengthen d) debase  4. Explain the phrase ‘gather resolution from danger’. a) Find peace in times of difficulty. b) To remain calm and not to lose hope. c) A state of utter hopelessness makes one determined to face the difficulty. d) To be enthusiastic and brave the odds.  5. The author feels happy in the recollection of dangers faced and overcome because a) He felt elated as he was alive. b) They added a new perspective and lifted him above himself for a time. c) They brought him a new experience. d) These experiences boosted his confidence.

2 - 08 Dec 2023 12:03PM - Shubham Madhwal: Greetings Thabo and Ms Mdeya!  I am Mr Shubham, The Senior Acadmecian at Edoofa.  I am here to discuss the application of Thabo  Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session  Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
3 - 08 Dec 2023 12:08PM - +260 96 5754444: Am the mother to Thabo. My understanding is that you give scholarship to students who are willing to study abroad to be specific in India.
4 - 08 Dec 2023 12:24PM - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
5 - 08 Dec 2023 12:24PM - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.
6 - 08 Dec 2023 12:24PM - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.
