I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
8/1/24, 2:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
8/1/24, 2:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.

9/1/24, 10:50 AM - +263 78 754 7995: How are you MS. Siddhi Sigh 
Hope you are doing well and enjoying your new year
9/1/24, 11:09 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am well, dear. Thank you for asking.

A new year brings forth a multitude of possibilities and fresh opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practise more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?
10/1/24, 8:24 AM - +263 78 754 7995: Good morning Ms  Sidhi Sigh

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. I was hoping to get a response from your end following my previous messages. However, in recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 8:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
