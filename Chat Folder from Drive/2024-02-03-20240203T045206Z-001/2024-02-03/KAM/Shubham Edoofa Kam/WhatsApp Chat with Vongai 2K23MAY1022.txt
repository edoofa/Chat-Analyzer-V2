16/1/24, 11:09 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Vongai,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 11:09 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
17/1/24, 10:22 AM - +27 73 679 6781: We are good how a you. We are happy about results but finance problem now.

17/1/24, 1:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly allow us time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, Mr. Shubham, the senior career counselor at Edoofa will connect with you to guide you on the next steps in your academic career.

I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction, I remembered that during our session you portrayed an enormous potential of becoming a leader of tomorrow. Hence I have asked my Colleague *Mr Shubham, Senior Academician* to personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority. 

Hence I request you to come online and continue with your admission procedures.

1/2/24, 9:42 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good Morning Everyone, 

*“Education is the best friend. An educated person is respected everywhere. Education beats the beauty and the youth.”*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
1/2/24, 10:59 AM - +27 73 679 6781: Yes lets continue.
1/2/24, 12:12 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
1/2/24, 12:13 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counseling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program *as we recommended your application for a higher quantum of scholarship.* Congratulations on the same. Now, let us assume,
1/2/24, 12:13 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*

4. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
1/2/24, 12:13 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education ($1650-$1000= $650) and this remaining fee of $650 is supposed to be paid within 3 days of arrival.

*Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
1/2/24, 12:56 PM - +27 73 679 6781: I dont have questions about this.
1/2/24, 1:39 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
1/2/24, 4:13 PM - +27 73 679 6781: Yes
1/2/24, 4:13 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I understand that you are interested in this golden opportunity to study in India under the given Scholarship. I do realize that your Family Members may have other concerns and this is the reason I have requested our Program Director Mr. Abhinav to spare some time to talk to your Parents about this. I hope you recall that he was the one to Interview you and had a Video Call earlier.

*So I request the parents to be active for this interactive video call session with the Program Director* so that he can financially assist you and plan your child's higher education on Priority.

1/2/24, 5:15 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
2/2/24, 8:10 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good morning! let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*Proverbs 9:9 (NIV):*
*"Instruct the wise and they will be wiser still; teach the righteous and they will add to their learning."*

Let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education.
2/2/24, 9:03 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: @27736796781 Are you ready for the video call
2/2/24, 4:33 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I was expecting your response, but I can see that you were not able to attend the session due to reasons unknown to us, Please understand that the only way that I and My team will be able to assist you is with your cooperation and participation in these sessions, taking out 20-30 minutes from your daily life can truly transform your child's life, *Hence I have scheduled your session for tomorrow at 09:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day.
