16/1/24, 11:17 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Simbarashe ,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey. <This message was edited>
16/1/24, 11:22 AM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

1/2/24, 2:39 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me help you understand the Situation in Zimbabwe in much more detail

While the cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, the cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal which is Sadza and curry costs a student $1 one time and you are aware of this better. The cost of *Accommodation, Food, Wifi, stationery, gadgets, transport* etc is an additional expense for a student. The initial registration fee for the Zimbabwean Universities ranges from *$20-$75 without the guarantee of being eligible or not.* The *attachment fee before graduation ranges from $200 or more.* <This message was edited>
1/2/24, 2:40 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me tell you, I was caught in surprise when I compared it with the Edoofa Scholarship Program, not because of affordability but the opportunity to acquire skills, knowledge and be employable. Speaking about Employability, do you feel Zimbabwe is ready to equip the graduates with job opportunities in their aspired fields?
2/2/24, 9:25 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good morning! let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*Proverbs 9:9 (NIV):*
*"Instruct the wise and they will be wiser still; teach the righteous and they will add to their learning."*

Let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education.
