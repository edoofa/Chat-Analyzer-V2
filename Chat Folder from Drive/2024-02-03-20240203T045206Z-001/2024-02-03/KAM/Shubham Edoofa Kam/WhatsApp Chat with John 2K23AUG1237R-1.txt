20/12/23, 6:24 PM - +260 771923158: Good evening,
Hope everything is going on well as we go through closer to our Christmas. 
I wanted to ask, what’s happening about the university because we have not received any response yet and by that it’s making us concerned as we accepted the university and looking forward to our next step
27/12/23, 3:27 PM - +260 771923158: Good afternoon, I hope this message finds you on a good note. We have been relying on your Edoofa scholarship program but with what is happening at the moment my parents and I would say we are not proud of what is happening, if really edoofa would get in touch with many universities as your service works like you’re brokers please let us know what to do so we would look forward to finding other scholarships.
22/1/24, 9:47 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good Day, John
*I am Mr Shubham, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. 
Recalling our interaction after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today.
22/1/24, 2:30 PM - +260 771923158: I’m good thank you
Okay thank you very much.
22/1/24, 3:01 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I am doing great please
22/1/24, 3:02 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: John, How were your results for the Advanced Levels?
22/1/24, 3:04 PM - +260 771923158: My results are not yet out
22/1/24, 7:30 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I will connect with you *tomorrow again at 09:00 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
22/1/24, 7:57 PM - +260 771923158: Okay no problem sir 
May God bless you too
23/1/24, 8:27 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good Morning Everyone, 

*"The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall."*

*When you step into this day realize that you have immense opportunities! All you need to do is give your best to grab it.*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
23/1/24, 11:09 AM - +260 771923158: Thank you for the quote.
23/1/24, 12:31 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: John you will have to understand that it takes time for the university and us to process your application, As we submit the same to multiple universities, so we request your patience for the same.  That's the reason you have only one letter so far. I will ensure that in the coming weeks, You receive an offer from a more recognized university so that we can continue your process at a much faster pace, And for that I would need your and your family's full cooperation and participation in the sessions to that will be held from now on.
23/1/24, 12:32 PM - +260 771923158: Okay understood
23/1/24, 12:33 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So shall we proceed ahead with your application process?
23/1/24, 12:40 PM - +260 771923158: Yes
23/1/24, 12:46 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: That is absolutely understandable and thank you for sharing. Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*? <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 12:47 PM - +260 771923158: Why?
23/1/24, 12:47 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 12:49 PM - +260 771923158: This is very true 💯
23/1/24, 12:50 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I see you are quite a visionary and we will work together to make the right decision for your career. It is important to know why the Edoofa guidance will be unique compared to the normal University approach.

Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:- As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
23/1/24, 12:50 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: The Earn While You Learn Program:-  Even though the EWYL program was affected by lessons and exams in Zimbabwe, you will have access to a streamlined process here in India with better earning projects, regular visits by mentors, seminars and training programs which even opens self-financing opportunities. Students have even catered their entire costs through their EWYL earnings.

Financial Support and Planning:- With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

Industrial Visits, Attachments and practical learning experiences- with the recent example of SLICE-CON which stands for Symposium of Leaders, Innovators and Creators with Edoofa Conclave 24 where our Edoofians embarked on an enlightening industrial visit, immersing themselves in dynamic interactions with our esteemed Founder, CEOs of different Companies which are recognized worldwide, and visionary entrepreneurs from the industry. We are also visiting Zimbabwe in February to prepare our Edoofians for their journey and help them with the next level of career.
23/1/24, 12:50 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Department of Student Welfare:- With a dedicated department to look after the Welfare of our Edoofians, our DSW officers operate directly from our university desks, being approachable to Edoofians for any assistance and motivating them to be on track with their careers.
23/1/24, 12:50 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: These are just a few of the various benefits and keeping all this in mind, are you ready to step into your higher education through the Edoofa Program which is the most popular scholarship in Africa?
23/1/24, 12:53 PM - +260 771923158: Yes I am ready
23/1/24, 12:56 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelor Of Commerce and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
23/1/24, 12:57 PM - +260 771923158: Yes it’s accurate
23/1/24, 1:00 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Duly noted John,

Lushomo Nakamwanza Mwiya

Do You know,  The following Students from your previous school Emmanuel Adventist Secondary School are preparing to arrive this year. I understand that we all have challenges in life and as your Career Counselor I am empathetic to provide you with the best solutions
23/1/24, 1:01 PM - +260 771923158: Yes I do know them very well
23/1/24, 1:03 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Glad to hear that please
23/1/24, 1:03 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*
23/1/24, 1:03 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
23/1/24, 1:06 PM - +260 771923158: Do you mind reminding me a little more about it
23/1/24, 1:08 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 
Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
23/1/24, 1:08 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.

*Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
23/1/24, 1:09 PM - +260 771923158: No it’s clear now
23/1/24, 1:09 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
23/1/24, 1:10 PM - +260 771923158: Yes I am
23/1/24, 1:20 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So before proceeding with the session, are there any questions you would like to ask?
23/1/24, 1:22 PM - +260 771923158: No for now I am clear.
23/1/24, 1:27 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So John, I understand that you are interested in this golden opportunity to study in India under the given Scholarship. I do realize that your Family Members may have other concerns and this is the reason I have requested our Program Director Mr. Abhinav to spare some time to talk to your Parents about this. I hope you recall that he was the one to Interview you and had a Video Call with your Parents?
23/1/24, 1:47 PM - +260 771923158: Yes I recall
