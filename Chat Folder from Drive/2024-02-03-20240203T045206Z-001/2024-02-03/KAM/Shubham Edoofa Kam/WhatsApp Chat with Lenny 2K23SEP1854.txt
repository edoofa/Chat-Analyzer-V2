16/1/24, 10:08 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Proud Edoofians,

I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test. <This message was edited>
16/1/24, 10:08 AM - Ashi Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
16/1/24, 10:09 AM - Ashi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
18/1/24, 10:26 PM - +27 84 448 3976: We are all fine thank you and happy new year to you too

19/1/24, 8:37 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are doing fine. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
19/1/24, 8:37 AM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
19/1/24, 9:24 AM - +27 84 448 3976: Yes they are happy with the results

19/1/24, 10:42 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
19/1/24, 10:43 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly allow us time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, Mr. Shubham, the senior career counselor at Edoofa will connect with you to guide you on the next steps in your academic career.
19/1/24, 10:46 AM - +27 84 448 3976: Thank you
19/1/24, 10:59 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Most welcome, Have a good day ahead!
19/1/24, 4:32 PM - +27 84 448 3976: Thank you
22/1/24, 10:03 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good Day, Lenny
*I am Mr Shubham, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. 
Recalling our interaction after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today.
22/1/24, 10:27 AM - +27 84 448 3976: Thank you

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
23/1/24, 12:32 PM - +27 84 448 3976: Morning how are you
23/1/24, 12:46 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I am doing great please
23/1/24, 12:46 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Congratulations! For qualifying the Advanced Levels. The time has come when you and your family have to now make rational decisions as this is an impactful turning point in your career.
23/1/24, 12:46 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications weekly from students seeking Scholarships?
23/1/24, 12:59 PM - +27 84 448 3976: I am not aware of that
23/1/24, 1:41 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So Lenny, Just before I connected with you, I had a word with our Head Admissions Officer, Ms Vilsha and was quite taken aback by the news your application is still under process despite the passing of the months since we last interacted. You being one of my favourite students, I was intrigued to know the reasons behind the same and I wish to guide you in the very best way possible.
23/1/24, 1:51 PM - +27 84 448 3976: It is because of the challenge of finances
23/1/24, 2:06 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *I am sure you and your family must have also discussed about this issue,*. So what have you decided for your future ahead?
23/1/24, 2:07 PM - +27 84 448 3976: We are still organizing for the money
23/1/24, 3:30 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: That is absolutely understandable and thank you for sharing. Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.


*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
23/1/24, 5:39 PM - +27 84 448 3976: No
23/1/24, 7:28 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Please why are you replying so late, I was expecting your response, but it seems you were occupied at that moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 09:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
23/1/24, 8:19 PM - +27 84 448 3976: I think it's network problem
24/1/24, 8:06 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good Morning Everyone, 

*“Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today.” —Malcolm X"*

*When you step into this day realize that you have immense opportunities! All you need to do is give your best to grab it.*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
24/1/24, 9:21 AM - +27 84 448 3976: Good morning to you too
24/1/24, 10:09 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Shall we continue from here?
24/1/24, 10:09 AM - +27 84 448 3976: Yes
24/1/24, 11:27 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 12:27 PM - +27 84 448 3976: Ok
24/1/24, 1:34 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I see you are quite a visionary and we will work together to make the right decision for your career. It is important to know why the Edoofa guidance will be unique compared to the normal University approach.
24/1/24, 1:34 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: 1. *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
24/1/24, 1:34 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: 2. *The Earn While You Learn Program:*  Even though the EWYL program was affected by lessons and exams in Zimbabwe, you will have access to a streamlined process here in India with better earning projects, regular visits by mentors, seminars and training programs which even opens self-financing opportunities. Students have even catered their entire costs through their EWYL earnings. <This message was edited>
24/1/24, 1:35 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: 3. *Financial Support and Planning:* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.
24/1/24, 1:35 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: 4. *Industrial Visits, Attachments and practical learning experiences:* With the recent example of SLICE-CON which stands for Symposium of Leaders, Innovators and Creators with Edoofa Conclave 24 where our Edoofians embarked on an enlightening industrial visit, immersing themselves in dynamic interactions with our esteemed Founder, CEOs of different Companies which are recognized worldwide, and visionary entrepreneurs from the industry. We are also visiting Zimbabwe in February to prepare our Edoofians for their journey and help them with the next level of career. <This message was edited>
24/1/24, 1:36 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: 5. *Department of Student Welfare:* With a dedicated department to look after the Welfare of our Edoofians, our DSW officers operate directly from our university desks, being approachable to Edoofians for any assistance and motivating them to be on track with their careers.
24/1/24, 1:36 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: These are just a few of the various benefits and keeping all this in mind, are you ready to step into your higher education through the Edoofa Program which is the most popular scholarship in Africa?
24/1/24, 2:43 PM - +27 84 448 3976: Can you give me some time to go through this
24/1/24, 4:04 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Have you gone through the same?
24/1/24, 4:59 PM - +27 84 448 3976: Yes i am ready
24/1/24, 5:40 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I have noted all your responses for the day, Since my working hours for the day are over now, *I have therefore scheduled your session for 09:30 AM CAT tomorrow*

God Bless you,
Have a great day ahead!
24/1/24, 5:58 PM - +27 84 448 3976: Thank you
25/1/24, 8:28 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good Morning Everyone, 

*“If you think education is expensive, try ignorance.” --- Andy McIntyre*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
25/1/24, 8:55 AM - +27 84 448 3976: Good morning
25/1/24, 9:16 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA (Sociology) and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
25/1/24, 9:31 AM - +27 84 448 3976: Yes it's true
25/1/24, 9:32 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
25/1/24, 9:34 AM - +27 84 448 3976: Yes
25/1/24, 10:25 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
25/1/24, 10:26 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 
Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
25/1/24, 10:26 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee that you pay will be subtracted from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.

*Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
25/1/24, 10:49 AM - +27 84 448 3976: You can continue
25/1/24, 10:51 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
25/1/24, 11:43 AM - +27 84 448 3976: Yes
25/1/24, 12:19 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So Lenny, Now please ask your parents to com eoonline?
25/1/24, 12:20 PM - +27 84 448 3976: I am the parent speaking onbehalf of Lenny
25/1/24, 12:50 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Duly noted,  I understand that you are interested in this golden opportunity to study in India under the given Scholarship. I do realize that your Family Members may have other concerns and this is the reason I have requested our Program Director Mr. Abhinav to spare some time to talk to you. I hope you recall that he was the one to Interview you and had a Video Call with your Parents. <This message was edited>
25/1/24, 12:54 PM - +27 84 448 3976: Yes I still remember

1/2/24, 12:09 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Hello @27844483976 
During your session with the Program Director a few days back, He mentioned that he had made a special exemption for your child and that he would be personally looking over your child's application. *Since then he has personally forwarded your child's application to various universities here In India for a higher quantum of scholarship.*

*But I believe he also asked you to complete the initial registration formalities on priority as he would be visiting Zimbabwe in the second week of February*, So May I know about the updates regarding the same and when are you planning to complete the formalities towards the semester fees?
1/2/24, 12:24 PM - +27 84 448 3976: I will see this February I will make a plan
1/2/24, 12:36 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Are you aware of the transaction methodds please?

1/2/24, 1:53 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me share with you the payment methods as well!
1/2/24, 1:54 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: If you can make the payment from Harare, that case the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
1/2/24, 1:54 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
1/2/24, 1:54 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
1/2/24, 1:54 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send.
