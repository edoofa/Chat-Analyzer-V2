16/1/24, 10:42 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Recall,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey. <This message was edited>
16/1/24, 10:43 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further? <This message was edited>

24/1/24, 8:39 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good Day, dear parent and Recall
*I am Mr Shubham, Senior Acadmecian at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence I request you to come online at the earliest and notify me so that I can guide you ahead.

24/1/24, 8:44 AM - +27 62 910 6062: Hi Mr Shubbman  thanks for  your concern  .Recall  did obtain  6 points  but as we said  before  we're  not happy  with  your  fees they're  very  expensive  and totally   we can't  manage  there are  universities  which are cheaper  and affordable  in Africa
24/1/24, 8:45 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good Morning Mrs Gladys,

Can you help me understand your concern better, as in what issues are you facing please?
24/1/24, 8:50 AM - +27 62 910 6062: No truly speaking  I was so disappointed  because  what you said at first  and now is much different  your  running  bussiness  not scholarship  how can I pay 2800USA  of which  is 56000 in rands which  means  yearly  I have to pay more than 100 thousand rands of which  I can't do  that
24/1/24, 8:51 AM - +27 62 910 6062: Recall  can learn  in other  universities  which are cheaper  and affordable  I lost trust in you
24/1/24, 8:59 AM - +27 62 910 6062: We are in Africa  we earn in rands  but you  think  it's  easy  to have USA dollar  it's better  to choose  where  I can manage  and afford  you convinced me  to pay the acceptance  money  I thought  and believe  it was some  thing  good for my son but I noticed  all in all your  after  money  not to help  communities
24/1/24, 9:11 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Mrs Gladys, to help you clarify your doubt, the annual fees for Recall will be around 56000 rands only including accommodation food and Remaining Tuition fees. It's not hundred thousand rands please
24/1/24, 9:22 AM - +27 62 910 6062: That is alright please. You can use any of the modes that you prefer. Moving ahead, For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
24/1/24, 9:24 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Yes please, and $2800 is the annual fee after the scholarship, equivalent to 56000 SA Rands correct?
24/1/24, 9:34 AM - +27 62 910 6062: Remember  there is no food  and accommodation  and flights  so ummm  it's too expensive  I can't  afford
24/1/24, 9:35 AM - +27 62 910 6062: How much  is the scholarship  paying  also where is the earn while  u learn
24/1/24, 9:45 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Please the $2800 includes the food  and accommodation Mrs Gladys
24/1/24, 9:52 AM - +27 62 910 6062: Ok .l will come back to  you because  I have  to do a  verification  with other  universities  and do a comparison  because  MSU and UZ is 6 to 700 USA
24/1/24, 10:45 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Please by MSU you meant Middladns state university and for UZ you meant the University of Zimbabwe is that correct?
24/1/24, 11:06 AM - +27 62 910 6062: Yes thus  correct  your  right
24/1/24, 12:51 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats, however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge.  Having Conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

24/1/24, 12:51 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I am shocked to compile these data for Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities of Zimbabwe.

*Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE)* -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - *($680 per term)*

*Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT)* https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - *($535 per term)*

*University of Zimbabwe (UZ)* -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm *($523 per term)*

NUST -*($870 per term)*
24/1/24, 12:53 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So after looking at the facts shared above what do you think is more advantageous, to study at a globally recognized university abroad with an abundance of exposure and opportunities along with a similar fee structure as compared to studying at a local university where you will have no guarantee if you would get a job or not?
24/1/24, 7:04 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 8:25 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good Morning Everyone,

30/1/24, 8:54 AM - +27 62 910 6062: Morning  sir .l think  I did  explain  that  we can't  afford  universities in  lndia.  Recall  is in process  of applications  in Africa
30/1/24, 8:56 AM - +27 62 910 6062: We have to do  things which  we can  manage  ourselves because  we have  a lot do it's  notonly  about Recall s  education  but we have  other  kids  attending  schools  so please  I can't  manage
30/1/24, 8:57 AM - +27 62 910 6062: Schooling  is the same  whether  in India  or Africa  but what's  important  a child  is attending  schools
30/1/24, 9:28 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: @27629106062 I understand that you must be facing financial challenges, But I guess you are looking things from a different perspective altogether
30/1/24, 9:28 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me help you understand the Situation in Zimbabwe in much more detail

While the cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, the cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal which is Sadza and curry costs a student $1 one time and you are aware of this better. The cost of *Accommodation, Food, Wifi, stationery, gadgets, transport* etc is an additional expense for a student. The initial registration fee for the Zimbabwean Universities ranges from *$20-$75 without the guarantee of being eligible or not.* The *attachment fee before graduation ranges from $200 or more.*
30/1/24, 9:29 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me tell you, I was caught in surprise when I compared it with the Edoofa Scholarship Program, not because of affordability but the opportunity to acquire skills, knowledge and be employable. Speaking about Employability, do you feel Zimbabwe is ready to equip the graduates with job opportunities in their aspired fields?
30/1/24, 9:35 AM - +27 62 910 6062: No Mr Shubbman  offcourse  my country  it's  in crisis  but I can't  run away from  my country  at the same time  it's  not only Recall  but many  students  .Recall did  learn  in  Zimbabwe  from  zero  grade up to A level  still  in the same  country  so wat has changed
30/1/24, 9:38 AM - +27 62 910 6062: We can't  afford  thus all . I have  my sister 's two kids at MSU from  last year on the 27 Feb they  going  back  to school  and it's  an advantage  to me because  I will  be paying  half half  unlike  you when  you need money  you just  say put money tomorrow
30/1/24, 9:40 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Okay, I believe you have mis understanding about the procedures all together Mrs Gladys,
30/1/24, 9:41 AM - +27 62 910 6062: Do you mean  after  educating  the students  you give  them  jobs  . We know  you going  to sent them back  home  for them  to find  themselves  jobs
30/1/24, 9:41 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Shall I help you first clarify the grey areas you are getting confused at before you make any decisions?
30/1/24, 9:42 AM - +27 62 910 6062: This  is about  money  issues   Mr Shubbman  not political  issues  of the  countries  better  for him to learn  in SA
30/1/24, 9:43 AM - +27 62 910 6062: There  are millions of  students  learning  locally  in Africa
30/1/24, 9:59 AM - +27 62 910 6062: There is  a lot  of things  to do for Recall to access  lndian  universities  of which  we can't  afford  .l was home  December  and we sit down  to calculate  how  we have  an answer to  what  better for  us remember  how much  is a plane  to lndia  from  Zimbabwe  a lot of money
30/1/24, 10:43 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: @27629106062 During our Counselling Sessions I specifically recall that you mentioned why you wanted Recall to study abroad, the reason you stated was that the infrastructure back their in Africa was not strong enough to provide Recall with a good job opportunity please!
30/1/24, 10:45 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I have counselled ten's  of thousands of students and I am aware of the issues a parent and students face, After multiple interactions with them, I have come to noticed that even after completing their degrees in Africa, People work in a supermarket, or a sim card seller or working at a gas station
30/1/24, 10:46 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I also understand the financial commitment and hardships it takes for a parent to educate their child. *But because of that, you cannot neglect the importance of quality education*. Knowing the situation back there in Africa, the majority of students after completing their bachelor's degree have no guarantee of employment security.
30/1/24, 10:46 AM - +27 62 910 6062: I think  I am done  Mr Shubbman  I can't  afford
30/1/24, 10:47 AM - +27 62 910 6062: I don't think  you can push  or force the situation  I can't  pay  such lots of money
30/1/24, 10:48 AM - +27 62 910 6062: Thus  all I can say
30/1/24, 10:48 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: @27629106062 Please I can assist Recall attain a higher quantum scholarship as well, All I would need is your participation and cooperation during theses sessions.

30/1/24, 10:51 AM - +27 62 910 6062: You were  supposed to  to do that  for  the  first  time  interactions
30/1/24, 10:52 AM - +27 62 910 6062: It's  stressing  me so please  let's  stop
30/1/24, 10:53 AM - +27 62 910 6062: Becides  every thing  lndia  is very far if my son get into  problem  I will  get stuck
30/1/24, 10:55 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: @27629106062 All of your concern are totally Genuine
30/1/24, 10:56 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As a parent, i am sure you will have these apprehensions and that is totally justified
30/1/24, 10:58 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *The following Students from Recall's Previous School Chibuwe High School already here in India and some of them are preparing to arrive this year.* I understand that we all have challenges in life and as Recall's Career Counselor, I am empathetic to helping him achieve the best of opportunities that are out there for him to be offered.
