16/1/24, 10:57 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Yamikani,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 10:57 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

16/1/24, 2:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Sahil, the senior career counselor at Edoofa personally showed interest in your application and I believe he is already connected with you to guide you on the next steps in your academic career and you can inquire about the same query above with him.

24/1/24, 5:39 PM - +263 78 277 6409: Wrong informatio
24/1/24, 5:39 PM - +263 78 277 6409: I am Yamikani
24/1/24, 5:41 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for pointing the same and please excuse us @263782776409. there was a clerical error in the breakup shared. We have corrected the same breakup and I believe everything should be in order now.
24/1/24, 5:48 PM - +263 77 518 8153: Initially you had said 750 ,now it's 895 .I don't remember coming across this 10%issue .Can you be transparent on such issues from the onset please
24/1/24, 5:53 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: @263775188153, the registration fee is still $750 and the same has been mentioned in your offer letter from the university and the discussion you had with your career counselor - Mr. Sahil. The team has been transparent with you since day one and if you feel that hasn't been the case, I would encourage you to please refer to the conversations team has had with you all along and I am certain the concern you have would be addressed on its own. 

With that said @263775188153, the transfer charges of 10% mentioned are for the International Transfer Charges that the bank charges to facilitate the payment from one country to other. When you make the ooayment of $825 at your end, the amount that we will receive in India would be $750. These charges are deducted as per the policy of the Paypal and we have no control over it.
24/1/24, 6:01 PM - +263 77 518 8153: Ok I'm used to Google pay .so PayPal is expensive.
24/1/24, 6:15 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: That is alright @263775188153, I understand. However, correct me if I am wrong, but Google Pay is an application that is used in India for transfers from one Indian account to another Indian account. Do you mean to say you processed your payment from India?
24/1/24, 6:49 PM - +263 77 518 8153: I'm saying where I am,I normally use Googlepay.No problem.I understand how PayPal works.its my first time using PayPal anyway
24/1/24, 7:10 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: I see @263775188153. If you don't mind me asking, may I know where are you residing currently?
2/2/24, 11:05 AM - +263 77 518 8153: May I have the PayPal invoice
2/2/24, 11:09 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Parents and Yamikani.
