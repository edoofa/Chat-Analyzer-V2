This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
16/1/24, 3:54 PM - +27 64 274 2237: Yes I am clear about everything, and the groups purposes.
16/1/24, 4:02 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
16/1/24, 4:12 PM - +27 67 758 7984: EWYL is the best aspect that I think has made me realise how Edoofa can help my son achieve his goals at very affordable price.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
24/1/24, 12:51 PM - +27 67 758 7984: I'm ready yes, we can start
24/1/24, 12:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 6:59 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning @27677587984 @27642742237!
I hope you are doing well and are having a wonderful start to the day. Since I was hoping for a response from your side, we were not able to take forward our session in our last conversation. We are going to have our session today at 12:30 PM to take forward Wishes' admission journey forward. I hope that you are going to be on time for our session.
26/1/24, 7:05 AM - +27 67 758 7984: We left at this stage,  so I will be waiting for the explanations of each section of this 👆👆
26/1/24, 7:07 AM - Dev Edoofa: okay @27677587984, let me explain that you right now,
26/1/24, 7:07 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
26/1/24, 7:07 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
26/1/24, 7:11 AM - +27 67 758 7984: Crystal clear 🙏
26/1/24, 7:11 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps - 

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
26/1/24, 7:11 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
26/1/24, 7:13 AM - +27 67 758 7984: Ryt behind you
26/1/24, 7:14 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
26/1/24, 7:14 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
26/1/24, 7:29 AM - Dev Edoofa: Are you clear with the above steps @27677587984?
26/1/24, 7:30 AM - +27 67 758 7984: Very much clear sir
26/1/24, 7:30 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
26/1/24, 7:32 AM - +27 67 758 7984: Yes please
26/1/24, 7:33 AM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
26/1/24, 7:33 AM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
26/1/24, 7:35 AM - +27 67 758 7984: Ready please
26/1/24, 7:37 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

26/1/24, 7:38 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

26/1/24, 7:38 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
26/1/24, 7:40 AM - Dev Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session is scheduled at 12:30 PM so make sure you watch the videos before that.
26/1/24, 7:40 AM - Dev Edoofa: I hope you are clear?
26/1/24, 7:50 AM - +27 67 758 7984: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 7:51 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is good to know you can watch the videos now and share your understanding of each of the four videos before the session.
26/1/24, 11:57 AM - Dev Edoofa: Hello @27677587984!
I hope you are doing well. May I know if you were able to watch the videos that were shared with you ?
26/1/24, 12:11 PM - +27 67 758 7984: Yes I managed to watch them. 

But ryt now I'm in the middle of somerhing as I'm also at work. 

Will get back to you if the chance avails itself again
26/1/24, 12:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: No worries @27677587984! What I will do is that I will share with you the next step of the admission journey.
26/1/24, 12:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now that, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
26/1/24, 12:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move Wishes' application ahead and help Wishes write a proper statement of purpose so that he/she can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to a Job. So, for the team to work on Wishes' application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, we would require Wishes' availability for approximately 30 minutes. If he is unavailable, he can provide you with his input, and you can proceed with the statement of purpose on his behalf.
26/1/24, 12:25 PM - Dev Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in Wishes' admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

26/1/24, 12:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 12:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 12:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once you share these documents and complete the two tasks that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process.

1/2/24, 10:01 PM - +27 67 758 7984: <Media omitted>

2/2/24, 10:23 AM - Dev Edoofa: Sure, @27677587984!
2/2/24, 1:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon @27677587984!
May I know if you are available to take forward the session?
2/2/24, 1:29 PM - +27 67 758 7984: Yes I am ready now
2/2/24, 1:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!
2/2/24, 1:34 PM - Dev Edoofa: With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey, i.e. *Introduction to Financial Secure Plan*.
2/2/24, 1:34 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course Wishes has selected for his higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that he is planning to arrive in India in August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate? <This message was edited>
2/2/24, 1:35 PM - +27 67 758 7984: Yes it is very accurate
2/2/24, 1:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
2/2/24, 1:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
2/2/24, 1:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
2/2/24, 1:38 PM - +27 67 758 7984: Yes I am , but hoping you gonna an understandable clarity as to how?
2/2/24, 1:39 PM - +27 67 758 7984: Give👆
2/2/24, 1:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: Surely, @27677587984! Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
2/2/24, 1:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
2/2/24, 1:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
2/2/24, 1:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
2/2/24, 1:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
2/2/24, 1:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
2/2/24, 1:45 PM - +27 67 758 7984: Yes this is what we wish to have.
2/2/24, 1:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
2/2/24, 1:47 PM - +27 67 758 7984: Yes please, that will be nice.
2/2/24, 1:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in February 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025. <This message was edited>
2/2/24, 1:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
2/2/24, 1:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
2/2/24, 1:49 PM - +27 67 758 7984: Yes
2/2/24, 1:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
2/2/24, 1:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
2/2/24, 1:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
2/2/24, 1:53 PM - +27 67 758 7984: Yes I understand this
2/2/24, 1:53 PM - +27 67 758 7984: But need more clarity on this?
2/2/24, 1:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now @27677587984, in the counseling sessions that were done with Wishes, he must have gotten to know about the EWYL program. EWYL program provides the opportunity for hardworking students to self-finance their higher education on top of the scholarship provided in the Edoofa scholarship program.

This program also assists the students to have a finesse on skills that are prerequisites before venturing into any field and climbing the ladder of success.
2/2/24, 1:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: In this program, Wishes will have the opportunity to earn scholarship credits by working on projects that will be provided to him and these credits can be used to pay the fees of higher education here in India.
2/2/24, 1:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: I hope you understand now @27677587984?
2/2/24, 2:09 PM - +27 67 758 7984: Loud and clear now.
2/2/24, 2:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now with that said, there is also another benefit of this plan. I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
2/2/24, 2:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
2/2/24, 2:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
2/2/24, 2:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
2/2/24, 2:11 PM - +27 67 758 7984: Yes that's true.
2/2/24, 2:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to hear. Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
2/2/24, 2:13 PM - +27 67 758 7984: Yes please do.
2/2/24, 2:25 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350.
2/2/24, 2:25 PM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500.
2/2/24, 2:25 PM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
2/2/24, 3:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: Are you available @27677587984?
