8/1/24, 3:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: Soon after, we will guide you through the initiation of your EWYL Journey. The next batch of EWYL Sessions is scheduled to commence on Tuesday (16th January) and hence, if we are able to focus and complete the Admission Process before Friday with pure consistency, you will be able to start your EWYL journey as well in a timely manner.
8/1/24, 3:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: Kindly mark this date on your calendar and ensure that you are available to complete the necessary procedures within the stipulated timeline. If everything is proceeding as planned so far, shall we move forward and begin our session for the day?
8/1/24, 3:26 PM - +263 77 525 2551: I have noted the date
8/1/24, 3:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
8/1/24, 3:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *Munashe 2K23DEC2326*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
8/1/24, 3:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *Munashe EWYL23E1147*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
8/1/24, 3:56 PM - +263 77 525 2551: Acknowledged sir
8/1/24, 4:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with Munashe's counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into his academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in his achievements and be dedicated to ensuring his access to the finest opportunities to launch his career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about his counseling session with his counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
9/1/24, 8:34 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Munashe!
I hope all of you are doing great! We are here to help you and launch your career to greater heights and with that, I wanted to address that since we were not able to take forward our conversation yesterday. So may I please know if you are facing any kind of challenges in attending the sessions?

If not, we will have our session today at 10:30 am.
9/1/24, 9:23 AM - +263 77 525 2551: Morning sir,is it possible to do the session on Friday and Saturday
12/1/24, 1:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Munashe!

With great excitement and pride, I want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
12/1/24, 1:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experience. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
12/1/24, 1:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we start our session today, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

26/1/24, 7:41 AM - Dev Edoofa: Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about Munashe's university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.
26/1/24, 7:44 AM - +263 77 525 2551: Ok let's go on
26/1/24, 7:48 AM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 7:50 AM - +263 77 525 2551: I have read the image,u can go ahead explaining sir
26/1/24, 7:52 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
26/1/24, 7:52 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
26/1/24, 7:55 AM - +263 77 525 2551: Understood sir
26/1/24, 7:57 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps - 

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
26/1/24, 7:57 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
26/1/24, 8:01 AM - +263 77 525 2551: Yes I m with u
26/1/24, 8:02 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
26/1/24, 8:02 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
26/1/24, 8:04 AM - +263 77 525 2551: Noted sir
26/1/24, 8:10 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
26/1/24, 8:11 AM - +263 77 525 2551: Yes let's go on
26/1/24, 8:15 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
26/1/24, 8:15 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait that distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
26/1/24, 8:15 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
26/1/24, 8:15 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
26/1/24, 8:15 AM - Dev Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection.
26/1/24, 8:16 AM - Dev Edoofa: May I know when will you be able to watch the videos so that we can take forward our conversation?
26/1/24, 8:18 AM - +263 77 525 2551: Ok will advise
26/1/24, 8:21 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is alright @263775252551! I would also like to inform you that you can also watch these videos and update Munashe about the information conveyed here once you connect with him. This will ensure that we are moving forward with our session at a steady pace as we are already lagging a lot in taking forward Munashe's admission journey.
26/1/24, 8:21 AM - Dev Edoofa: May I know when are you going to be able to watch the videos?
26/1/24, 8:29 AM - +263 77 525 2551: Already watching sir

26/1/24, 10:23 AM - Dev Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  I hope you were able to follow through with this?
26/1/24, 10:24 AM - +263 77 525 2551: Yes I followed it
26/1/24, 10:25 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move Munashe's application ahead and help Munashe to write a proper statement of purpose so that he/she can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to a Job. So, for the team to work on Munashe's application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, we would require Munashe's availability for approximately 30 minutes. If he is unavailable, he can provide you with hisr input, and you can proceed with the statement of purpose on his behalf.
26/1/24, 10:27 AM - Dev Edoofa: 1. I am sure you have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in Munashe's admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.
