I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am Mr. Dev Kumar, an Admission Officer at Edoofa. Alongside Ms. Vilsha, Head of Admissions at Edoofa, I am thrilled to be a part of your university admission journey.

Now that you've successfully completed your enrollment formalities, the commencement of your admission journey is scheduled for January 8th, 2024, starting at 1:30 PM CAT. To ensure a productive discussion, please ensure a smooth internet connection for the session.
5/1/24, 9:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: In this one-hour session, I, as your dedicated admission officer, will connect with you to explore your academic journey, understand your experiences, and gather essential information for your scholarship application. I'll also discuss your daily availability for future sessions. Count on me to guide you through the initial steps and address any queries you may have.

5/1/24, 9:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: It's crucial to print out these forms before our reconnection on January 8th, as the next batch for the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program is scheduled for 12th January.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?

12/1/24, 1:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Japhet!

With great excitement and pride, I want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
12/1/24, 1:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experience. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
12/1/24, 1:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we start our session today, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

18/1/24, 12:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: It is my pleasure to interact with you @263778547012!
18/1/24, 12:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
18/1/24, 12:10 PM - +263 77 854 7012: Yes we can
18/1/24, 12:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: This message was deleted
18/1/24, 12:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 12:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright please, I would encourage you to go through the above image representing your university admission process and once you are done, let me know so that I can explain the same to you in detail.
18/1/24, 12:20 PM - +263 77 854 7012: You can explain
18/1/24, 12:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
18/1/24, 12:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
18/1/24, 12:29 PM - +263 77 854 7012: Indeed clear
18/1/24, 12:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
18/1/24, 12:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
18/1/24, 12:42 PM - +263 77 854 7012: Following
18/1/24, 12:43 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
18/1/24, 12:43 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
18/1/24, 12:45 PM - +263 71 943 5579: Indeed, the steps are clear. What may need to be clearer is the level of involvement of gurdians/family in the processes.
18/1/24, 12:48 PM - +263 71 943 5579: Another quick question is on the registration fees. Seems a bit high. Is it the standard or it goes with the conditions of the scholarship
18/1/24, 1:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: I understand your concern @263719435579! But you must notice the fact that when applying for an international scholarship, the students must pay a fee much higher than this. But, Edoofa with its hard work and experience of 15 Years has been able to reduce the fee to this particular amount and has made it possible that this fee is eventually going to be part of your first year fee. 
Edoofa has also designed plans to assist students and their guardians in preparing their financials, which you will soon get to know about in further sessions.
18/1/24, 1:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: However, engaging in a detailed discussion at this stage may leave you unprepared to comprehend the upcoming steps. Therefore, I encourage you to hold onto any queries you have and follow through with the ongoing discussion, as this is a crucial part of your journey.

23/1/24, 12:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263776417859 @263778547012!
I hope you are doing well. I have been noticing for the past few sessions that we are not able to have fruitful conversations about  Japhet's admission journey. May I know if you are facing any challenges in attending these sessions? It will help us to understand your concerns and align ourselves accordingly.
23/1/24, 12:53 PM - +263 77 854 7012: Thank you 
Yes they are challenges beyond our control so l was thinking that how about you schedule your sessions to 19:30PM were everyone will be active after work.
23/1/24, 1:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about your available times. But, however, you need to understand that my operational hours are from 9:30 AM to 5:30 PM CAT. You also need to understand that 7:30 PM in Zimbabwe is 11:30 PM in India. So, it will not be possible for me to take forward our session at that time. So may I know, if you are going to be available between our operational hours? <This message was edited>
24/1/24, 10:19 AM - +263 77 641 7859: Hie how are you doing today...How long is our session ?
24/1/24, 11:09 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning @263776417859!
I hope you are doing well. The sessions are a maximum of 1 hour if you are active throughout.
24/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 77 641 7859: That's fine I think if we can do it from 4:30 pm to 5:30pm late hours it will be better.. we try to be active
24/1/24, 2:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: Okay. That is good to know. We will have our session at 4:30 PM. Till then, I would like you to watch the 4 videos that were shared with you and share your understanding of them here.
25/1/24, 8:23 AM - +263 78 438 6909: The first video was based on letting students seriously follow all instructions and to be open minded so that everything may flow for their enrollment and their life in the university.

The edoofa leaders also showed the they may give all they can interms of assistance so that we may not force challenges that may slow us from success. 

Working together with the edofa leaders may help us in the selection of universities and in our journey to India.
Infoming others ohout edoofa is a clear sign of love to others so we may aim higher together. Knowledge and attitude are most needed in all processes 

Lastly there is a statement of purpose which is important and is for convincing people so as to get a scholarship . Telling the why you need that university and your status, strengths and weakness may help convincing them 

Thank you
25/1/24, 4:44 PM - +263 77 641 7859: Good day
26/1/24, 8:05 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263776417859 @263778547012 @263784386909 !

26/1/24, 9:06 AM - +263 78 438 6909: Yes clear
26/1/24, 9:06 AM - Dev Edoofa: Great!
26/1/24, 12:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: Hello @263784386909!

27/1/24, 7:24 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning @263784386909!
I hope you are doing well. May I know what is the update on the above tasks?
27/1/24, 2:22 PM - +263 78 438 6909: <Media omitted>
27/1/24, 3:33 PM - +263 78 438 6909: Law of thermodynamics which is also called law of conservation of energy states that the change in a system's internal energy is equal to the difference between heat added to the system from its surroundings and work done by the system on its surroundings. 
This law way was reduced to 3 different laws namely First law,  Second law and Third law.
 First law of thermodynamics states states that energy cannot be created or destroyed but it can be changed to other different forms.
An example of the first law is when a object (car) moving it possesses kinetic energy.  When brakes are applied that kinetic energy is not lost but converted to heat energy.

Second law of thermodynamics states that for a spontaneous process, the entropy of the universe increases. For example if we bring a hot object into contact with a cold object the hot object cools down and the cold object heats up until an equilibrium is reached. The transfer of heat goes from hot to cold by conduction.

The third law of thermodynamics states that a perfect crystal at zero Kelvin has zero entropy.the example is,  steam or vapours of water are the gaseous forms of water at high temperature as the molecules within steam are randomly moving thus it will have high entropy
27/1/24, 3:55 PM - +263 78 438 6909: A valve is a device or natural object that regulates, directs or controls the flows of a fluid by opening, closing, or partially obstructing various passageways.

Butterfly valves are used in pipelines to shutoff flow. They used to totally  shut off the flow however some may use them to minimise the flow, which is not recommended as it may damage the valve disk and have a negative  effect on the sealing properties
27/1/24, 4:22 PM - +263 78 438 6909: Heat treatment is a group of industrial, thermal and metalworking processes used to alta the physical, and sometimes chemical, properties of a material. The most common application is metallurgical.  

It is done so as to achieve a desired result such as hardening or softening  of a material.it is used to alter the microstructure of metals and alloys such as steel and aluminium to impact properties which benefits the working life of a component
27/1/24, 11:55 PM - +263 78 438 6909: A compressor I a mechanical device that increase the pressure of a gas by reducing its volume.
There are 4 types of compressors namely reciprocating compressors, axial compressors, piston compressors and positive displacement compressors. 
Gas turbines use rotary type mainly axial flow turbines because it draws air from the atmosphere and compressed to the required pressure. Centrifugal compressors are also used in gas turbines
29/1/24, 10:24 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning @263784386909!
I hope you are doing well and have a wonderful weekend. Thank you for providing the responses to the questions on the document. I have taken note of it as well. May I know if you are ready to take forward our session?
29/1/24, 11:18 AM - +263 78 438 6909: I am ready
29/1/24, 11:20 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thanks for letting me know, @263784386909! I noticed that you didn't fill out the SOP form, which is crucial to moving forward. I would recommend you to fill this form right now, so that we can move forward.
29/1/24, 2:51 PM - +263 78 438 6909: <Media omitted>

29/1/24, 2:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!
29/1/24, 2:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
29/1/24, 2:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: This message was deleted
29/1/24, 2:58 PM - +263 78 438 6909: Ok
29/1/24, 3:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: However, before we start the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you were supposed to make the payment of the remaining part of the Edoofa Enrollment fee on 26th January. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand if you are facing any issues or challenges in doing so?
30/1/24, 12:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263784386909!
I hope you are doing well. Till then, I want to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Since there was a delay in initiating the EWYL program, the EWYL team is prepared to initiate your EWYL program today, i.e. 30th January. 

To kick-start the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:
30/1/24, 12:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: https://chat.whatsapp.com/LXJW39y8KMfB6Ph9JsuwTL

"Use the above-provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Japhet Mhike, and my EWYL group name is Japhet EWYL23E1120. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on 30/01/2024 to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*" <This message was edited>
30/1/24, 12:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
30/1/24, 12:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: I hope these instructions are clear?
30/1/24, 12:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, may I please get an update on this?
30/1/24, 3:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Japhet

I hope you are doing well. I was expecting a response from your end yesterday and today and hence I wanted to reach out to you once again and see if we are still connected. 

At the same time, I was going through your application file and as per the same, you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of the Edoofa Enrollment fee of $150 before 26 January 2024. 

In light of this, I wanted to reach out to you, share a gentle reminder, and try to understand if you have been able to make the payment of your fee by now so that we can update the academic board accordingly?
30/1/24, 4:53 PM - +263 77 641 7859: We are sorry for that but we are just having some challenges during this January season but we hope we will pay within this first two weeks of February if you can bear with us....
Our apologies please but we are still connected
30/1/24, 5:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: I understand, @263776417859, but it will not be possible for us to extend the deadline for two more weeks as it already has been 4 days. The current round of applications that you were a part of was for the month of January and according to that the enrollment formalities are to be completed by tomorrow 31st January 2024. 

Your remaining Edoofa Enrollment Fee is $150 and if we miss this deadline, the reapplication fee of $150 will be added making a total of $300. Now, I know that you don't want to pay such an amount. I hope you understand?
31/1/24, 2:40 PM - +263 77 641 7859: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 2:40 PM - +263 77 641 7859: Payment has been made
31/1/24, 4:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you so much for sharing the receipt of the payment. I have taken note of it and will update it in our records as well.
1/2/24, 2:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263776417859 @263784386909!
I hope you are doing well. I have noticed that for the past couple of days, we are not able to have fruitful conversations. May I know if you are ready to take forward our session?
1/2/24, 2:47 PM - +263 77 641 7859: Ready
1/2/24, 2:47 PM - +263 77 641 7859: How are you doing today
1/2/24, 2:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am doing absolutely fine! Thanks for asking.
1/2/24, 2:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course Japhet has selected for his higher education is B.Tech (Mechanical Engineering) and it's my understanding that he is planning to arrive in India in August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
1/2/24, 3:00 PM - +263 77 641 7859: The information is correct
1/2/24, 3:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
1/2/24, 3:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
1/2/24, 3:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
1/2/24, 3:32 PM - +263 77 641 7859: That's good let us hear about the plan
1/2/24, 3:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
1/2/24, 3:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
1/2/24, 3:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
1/2/24, 3:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
1/2/24, 3:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
1/2/24, 3:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
1/2/24, 7:23 PM - +263 77 641 7859: All the benefits above are  correct as far as tertiary education is concerned so how does this plan works
2/2/24, 10:32 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning @263776417859 @263784386909!
I hope you are doing well. Since our operational hours were over at the time you replied, I was not able to respond to you and take forward our conversation. May I know if you are available today to take forward our Japhet's admission journey?
2/2/24, 10:32 AM - Dev Edoofa: I will surely let you know about this in our today session.
2/2/24, 5:57 PM - +263 78 438 6909: Hello Admission officer,I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is  Ms Aditi and he/she has scheduled my session for 19 February 2024
