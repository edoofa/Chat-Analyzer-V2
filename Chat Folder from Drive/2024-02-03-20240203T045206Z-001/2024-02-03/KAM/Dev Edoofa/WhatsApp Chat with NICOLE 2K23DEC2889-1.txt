16/1/24, 4:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

As we progress, we will guide you on how university admissions work and how you can select the best one for your higher education.
16/1/24, 6:53 PM - Dev Edoofa: However, engaging in a detailed discussion at this stage may leave you unprepared to comprehend the upcoming steps. Therefore, I encourage you to hold onto any queries you have and follow through with the ongoing discussion, as this is a crucial part of your journey.

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
17/1/24, 2:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?

17/1/24, 2:29 PM - +263 71 297 5426: Yes
17/1/24, 2:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
17/1/24, 2:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?

23/1/24, 12:45 PM - +263 71 297 5426: Yes
23/1/24, 12:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know! May I please get to know about your understanding of each of the 4 videos that were shared with you?
23/1/24, 1:06 PM - +263 71 297 5426: In the videos I learnt that students should be open minded and should follow instructions. I also learnt that it's not only about education but students should be employable through the SEELS program. Founders also encourage  to follow instructions as to prepare and be qualified for the prestigious institution. Students should be prompt and be diligent in filling the forms
23/1/24, 1:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding of the 4 videos. I hope that you were able to feel the essence of the videos and understand the information conveyed.
23/1/24, 1:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
23/1/24, 1:10 PM - +263 71 297 5426: Yes
23/1/24, 1:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: This message was deleted
23/1/24, 1:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move Nicole's application ahead and help Nicole write a proper statement of purpose so that she can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on NAME’S application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, we would require Nicole's availability for approximately 30 minutes. If she is unavailable, she can provide you with her input, and you can proceed with the statement of purpose on her behalf.
23/1/24, 1:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in Nicole's admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

23/1/24, 1:29 PM - +263 71 297 5426: I understand
23/1/24, 1:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: Great!
23/1/24, 1:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Since due to some delays, the EWYL sessions were not started timely, the EWYL team are prepared to initiate your EWYL program Today,
23/1/24, 1:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: To kick start the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:
23/1/24, 1:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: https://chat.whatsapp.com/CnQRHu9jkAE6hMcta0aFOp

"Use the above-provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
23/1/24, 1:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: I hope you are clear with these steps?
23/1/24, 2:52 PM - +263 71 439 7817: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 2:53 PM - +263 71 439 7817: Soil fertility refers to the ability of soil to provide nutrients and support plant growth. It is determined by the presence and availability of essential nutrients, organic matter content, pH level, and overall soil structure.

There are several methods to check soil fertility, including:

1. Soil testing: This involves collecting soil samples from different areas of a field and analyzing them in a laboratory. Soil tests measure nutrient levels (such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium), pH, organic matter content, and other parameters.

2. Visual assessment: Farmers and agronomists can visually assess soil fertility based on plant health, growth patterns, and nutrient deficiencies or excesses. However, this method is subjective and may not provide precise measurements.

To improve soil fertility, various practices can be implemented, such as:

1. Adding organic matter: Incorporating organic materials like compost, manure, cover crops, or crop residues into the soil enhances nutrient content, improves soil structure, and promotes microbial activity.

2. Appropriate nutrient management: Nutrient deficiencies or imbalances can limit soil fertility. Adding fertilizers or soil amendments based on soil test results helps replenish nutrient levels and maintain a balanced nutrient ratio.

3. Crop rotation and diversification: Growing different crops in a rotation system helps break pest and disease cycles, enhances nutrient cycling, and increases organic matter content.

4. Conservation tillage: Reducing or eliminating tillage minimizes soil erosion, preserves soil structure, and protects soil organic matter.

5. Avoiding overuse of agrochemicals: Excessive use of fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides can negatively impact soil fertility and harm beneficial soil organisms. Practicing precision agriculture techniques optimizes the use of inputs based on actual crop needs.

6. Water management: Proper irrigation practices prevent soil erosion and leaching of nutrients. Conserving water resources and utilizing efficient irrigation methods, such as drip irrigation, can improve soil fertility.

It is important to note that soil fertility improvement is a continuous process, and long-term sustainable practices should be adopted to maintain and enhance soil health.
23/1/24, 2:53 PM - +263 71 439 7817: Technology can provide significant assistance to farmers in numerous ways. Here are some examples:

1. Precision Farming: Precision farming technologies, such as GPS, drones, and remote sensing, enable farmers to gather accurate data about their fields. This information helps farmers optimize irrigation, fertilization, and pesticide application, resulting in reduced costs, improved yields, and minimized environmental impacts.

2. Agricultural Machinery: Modern farming equipment, including tractors, combine harvesters, and seeders, have been technologically advanced. These machines enhance efficiency and productivity by automating various tasks, reducing labor requirements, and increasing overall farm output.

3. Crop Monitoring and Management: Sensors and remote monitoring systems can track soil moisture levels, temperature, and nutrient content. This data allows farmers to make informed decisions regarding irrigation, fertilization, and planting times, thereby maximizing crop health and yields.

4. Improved Plant Breeding: Biotechnology and genetic engineering aid in developing crop varieties with enhanced traits like disease resistance, drought tolerance, and higher yield potential. These advancements in genetics help farmers cultivate more robust and productive crops.

5. Weather Forecasting: Accurate weather forecasting systems assist farmers in planning their activities, such as planting, harvesting, and spraying, based on upcoming weather conditions. This knowledge helps optimize resource allocation and minimize potential risks associated with adverse weather events.

6. Data Analytics and Farm Management Software: Digital tools and farm management software enable farmers to collect and analyze data to make informed decisions. These technologies can track inventory, manage finances, plan operations, and optimize resource allocation, enhancing overall farm efficiency and profitability.

7. Market Access and E-commerce: Online platforms and marketplaces facilitate direct sales of agricultural products, connecting farmers directly with consumers and eliminating intermediaries. This technology provides farmers with greater market access, fairer pricing, and increased opportunities for income generation.

8. Sustainable Practices: Technology can support sustainable agriculture by reducing resource use and environmental impacts. For instance, robotic systems can precisely weed or pick fruits, reducing the need for herbicides and manual labor. Additionally, technologies for efficient water management, renewable energy, and waste management promote sustainability on farms.

By harnessing the power of technology, farmers can optimize their operations, increase productivity, reduce costs, make informed decisions, and contribute to more sustainable agricultural practices.
23/1/24, 2:53 PM - +263 71 439 7817: There are a variety of farming systems, but the most common are conventional farming, organic farming, and sustainable farming. Conventional farming is the most common type of farming system. It involves the use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and other chemicals to maximize crop yields. Organic farming is a system that avoids the use of synthetic chemicals and instead relies on natural methods to control pests and fertilize crops. Sustainable farming is similar to organic farming, but it also focuses on conserving resources and protecting the environment. All three systems have their benefits and drawbacks, and the choice of which system to use depends on the specific needs of
A major benefit of conventional farming is that it can produce high yields of crops, which is important to feed a growing population. However, it can have negative impacts on the environment and human health. Pesticides and fertilizers can pollute water and soil, and they can also harm wildlife. Organic farming can help to reduce environmental impacts, but it can be more difficult to achieve high yields. Sustainable farming aims to strike a balance between productivity and environmental protection, but it can be more costly and time-consuming. Ultimately, the choice of which farming system to use comes down to a number of factors, including the farmer's goals, the location 
Another important consideration is the type of crops being grown. For example, some crops, such as tomatoes, require a high level of care and management to produce a good yield. Therefore, a conventional system may be more appropriate for tomatoes, while sustainable or organic systems may be better suited for other crops. Additionally, the location of the farm can also play a role in determining which system is best. For example, farms in areas with a lot of rainfall may be better suited for organic farming, while farms in arid regions may be better suited for conventional.
23/1/24, 2:53 PM - +263 71 439 7817: Pesticides are chemicals that are used to control pests, such as insects, weeds, and fungi. There are many different types of pesticides, including herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, and rodenticides. Herbicides are used to kill weeds, while insecticides are used to kill insects. Fungicides are used to control fungi, and rodenticides are used to control rodents. Pesticides can be applied in a variety of ways, including spraying, dusting, and baiting. While pesticides can be effective at controlling pests, they can also pose risks to human health and the environment. Exposure to pesticides can cause a range
of health problems, including skin irritation, respiratory problems, and cancer. Pesticides can also harm wildlife and contaminate water supplies. To reduce the risks of pesticides, many farmers are now using integrated pest management (IPM) strategies. IPM is an approach that uses a combination of cultural, biological, and chemical methods to control pests in a way that is effective and also minimizes the risks to human health and the environment. IPM is an important part of sustainable farming systems. Overall, pesticides are a complex and controversial issue, and it is important to understand the risks and benefits of their use.
23/1/24, 3:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the responses to the document. Please fill out the Statement Of Purpose as well.
23/1/24, 3:33 PM - +263 71 439 7817: Ok
23/1/24, 4:48 PM - +263 71 297 5426: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 3:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Nicole!
I hope you are doing well. I have taken note of the above responses and will update them in our records as well. We have our session right now. May I know if you are available for our conversation?
24/1/24, 3:55 PM - +263 71 297 5426: Good afternoon sir am available
24/1/24, 3:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! Thank you for sharing the responses to the above tasks. I have taken note of these as well and upload in our records.
24/1/24, 4:00 PM - +263 71 297 5426: Thank you
24/1/24, 4:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, I noticed that you have joined the EWYL group but have not introduced yourself to your mentor. Please do so!
24/1/24, 4:16 PM - +263 71 297 5426: I thought it's Nicole only who introduces herself
24/1/24, 4:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am talking about Nicole only. Please ask her to do so.
24/1/24, 4:20 PM - +263 71 297 5426: Ok sir
26/1/24, 9:35 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mr. and Mrs. Ndlovu and Nicole!
I hope you are doing well and are having a wonderful start to the day. I felt a bit under the weather yesterday, so I took a day off to focus on my health. Today, I am feeling better and completely ready to take our conversation forward. We will have our conversation at 3:00 PM to take forward our conversation. May I know if you are going to be available at that time?
26/1/24, 9:37 AM - +263 71 297 5426: Noted. Good morning
26/1/24, 3:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afetrnoon @263712975426 and Nicole!
I hope you are doing well. May I know if you are ready to take forward our conversation?
26/1/24, 3:16 PM - +263 71 439 7817: Good afternoon am ready
26/1/24, 3:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that!
26/1/24, 3:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: This message was deleted
26/1/24, 3:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: We have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
26/1/24, 3:23 PM - +263 71 439 7817: Noted
26/1/24, 3:34 PM - Dev Edoofa: However, before we start the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
26/1/24, 3:36 PM - +263 71 439 7817: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 3:36 PM - +263 71 439 7817: This is the receipt
26/1/24, 3:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the reciept. I have take note of it and will update it in our records as well.
26/1/24, 3:39 PM - +263 71 439 7817: Ok
26/1/24, 3:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: In the meantime. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Agriculture) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India in August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
26/1/24, 3:48 PM - +263 71 439 7817: Yes it's correct
26/1/24, 3:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
26/1/24, 3:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
26/1/24, 3:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
26/1/24, 3:58 PM - +263 71 439 7817: Yes
26/1/24, 3:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
26/1/24, 3:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
26/1/24, 3:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.
26/1/24, 3:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
26/1/24, 3:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
26/1/24, 3:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
26/1/24, 3:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
26/1/24, 4:02 PM - +263 71 439 7817: It is
26/1/24, 4:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
26/1/24, 4:05 PM - +263 71 439 7817: No I understand
26/1/24, 4:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that but let me explain the plan and it's beneficial aspects in detail. It will help you to understand the working of the plan.
26/1/24, 4:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: Shall I explain?
26/1/24, 4:12 PM - +263 71 439 7817: Go ahead
26/1/24, 4:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
26/1/24, 4:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
26/1/24, 4:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
26/1/24, 4:13 PM - +263 71 439 7817: Yes
26/1/24, 4:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
26/1/24, 4:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
26/1/24, 4:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
26/1/24, 4:20 PM - +263 71 439 7817: Yes I do
26/1/24, 4:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
26/1/24, 4:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
26/1/24, 4:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
26/1/24, 4:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
26/1/24, 4:30 PM - +263 71 439 7817: Am not familiar with banks and charges
26/1/24, 4:30 PM - +263 71 439 7817: But I know you have to pay money to the bank for using it
26/1/24, 4:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, Nicole.
26/1/24, 4:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
26/1/24, 4:32 PM - +263 71 439 7817: Yes
26/1/24, 4:43 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay  before your due date of 06-Feb-2024
26/1/24, 4:43 PM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
26/1/24, 4:43 PM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
26/1/24, 4:44 PM - +263 71 439 7817: Yes
26/1/24, 4:46 PM - +263 71 297 5426: Good day sir we have paid the remaining $150
26/1/24, 4:47 PM - +263 71 297 5426: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 4:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. I have taken a note of it.
26/1/24, 4:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
26/1/24, 4:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
26/1/24, 4:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
26/1/24, 4:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
26/1/24, 4:52 PM - +263 71 439 7817: I think it's easier and will make the university costs easy
26/1/24, 5:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
26/1/24, 5:09 PM - +263 71 439 7817: Yes
26/1/24, 5:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
26/1/24, 5:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
26/1/24, 5:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
26/1/24, 5:18 PM - +263 71 439 7817: Good
26/1/24, 5:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
26/1/24, 5:21 PM - +263 71 439 7817: Yes
26/1/24, 5:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
26/1/24, 5:59 PM - +263 71 439 7817: Noted
26/1/24, 6:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you tomorrow to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
26/1/24, 6:35 PM - +263 71 439 7817: Noted
27/1/24, 11:48 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Nicole!

Please, how are you doing today? With regards to our discussion yesterday, I wanted to reach out and enquire if you are available for us to have a brief conversation?
27/1/24, 11:50 AM - +263 71 439 7817: Am doing fine and how are you
27/1/24, 11:50 AM - +263 71 439 7817: Am available
27/1/24, 11:51 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am doing fine as well. Thank you for asking.
27/1/24, 11:52 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are available for us to connect with each other. Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held last week, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
27/1/24, 11:53 AM - +263 71 439 7817: Am not familiar with it
27/1/24, 11:53 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is alright, Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
27/1/24, 11:53 AM - Dev Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
27/1/24, 11:53 AM - Dev Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
27/1/24, 11:54 AM - Dev Edoofa: Let me share a glimpse of the conference with you and your family, I am certain that you too would be this excited to attend such events when you come to India. <This message was edited>

27/1/24, 11:56 AM - +263 71 439 7817: It looks nice
27/1/24, 11:58 AM - Dev Edoofa: Certainly, Nicole. This was indeed a momentous step for all of our students, making them employable ready and giving them access to the right opportunities for their careers ahead.
27/1/24, 11:58 AM - Dev Edoofa: Also, regarding the discussion we had the yesterday about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
27/1/24, 11:59 AM - +263 71 439 7817: Not yet we haven't got the time since I was at school yesterday
27/1/24, 12:02 PM - Dev Edoofa: Okay! I understand, Nicole. May I know when will you be able to discuss it with your family?
27/1/24, 12:02 PM - +263 71 439 7817: Today
27/1/24, 12:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thanks for letting me know, Nicole! Please make sure to do it on priority.
27/1/24, 12:09 PM - +263 71 439 7817: Yes sir
29/1/24, 12:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Nicole!
I hope you are doing well and had a wonderful weekend. May I know if you were able to discuss the Edoofa Secure Plan with your family in detail?
29/1/24, 12:46 PM - +263 77 837 3731: Nicole will be online from 1330hrs
29/1/24, 12:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thanks for letting me know. May I know if you discussed the Edoofa Secure Plan with your family?
29/1/24, 12:54 PM - +263 71 297 5426: Good afternoon everyone
29/1/24, 12:58 PM - +263 71 297 5426: Yes we did. It's a good plan and it will make financial planning easy. Currently I have other plans so I can't start now I can only start serving in November since Nicole will be coming in August
29/1/24, 1:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: It's reassuring that you can understand the aspects of the Edoofa Secure Plan. But you also need to understand that, even though Nicole's admission year is 2025-2026, the admissions for 2025 are going to begin in August 2024. Now if you plan to start this plan in November, the admissions will close for the 2025 intake. Hence, Nicole will miss out on reserving a seat for her admission. 
Since the admissions start in August, you need to prepare for the finances from now only. Starting this plan in November makes no sense as the admissions will already be closed. I hope you understand?
29/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 71 297 5426: I do understand. Is it possible for her to start January 2026
29/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 71 297 5426: As it is it's not possible for me to save $150 every month
29/1/24, 2:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: I want you to understand that Nicole is enrolled for the admission year 2025. The academic intake for every cycle opens for one time only, i.e. August. Hence, it will not be possible for you to start the plan in January 2026.
31/1/24, 5:25 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Nicole!

I hope you are doing well. I was expecting a response from your end yesterday and hence I wanted to reach out to you once again and see if we are still connected.
31/1/24, 5:42 PM - +263 71 297 5426: I understand
31/1/24, 5:43 PM - +263 71 297 5426: Good afternoon sir it's unfortunate that I won't be able to start depositing money this month. The $150 financial plan
31/1/24, 5:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: I understand your decision @263712975426. But may I please get to know about the challenges that you are facing in detail? It will help us to align ourselves better and help you tackle these challenges.
31/1/24, 6:17 PM - +263 71 297 5426: Where I work I don't earn much. I also have 2 children how are writing exams this year. There is Nicole who is doing A level and her brother who is doing O level. I have a payment plan which I made with the headmaster of where they learn. So as it is I can't afford to save $150 because that is almost my salary hence I have to pay rent and transport to work
1/2/24, 10:58 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Nicole!
I hope you are doing well. Unfortunately, I couldn't take forward our conversation yesterday because our operational hours were over. I can completely understand the challenges that you have and know where you are coming from. But at the same time, you need to understand that when admission opens in August, you will have to pay $1000 to reserve a seat at the university, and after that more expenses are going to follow. 

After counseling thousands of students, we at Edoofa, recognized this challenge that most of the parents face due to which 20-30% of students fail to come to India every year, even after enrolling in the program. This plan was designed specifically to tackle this challenge and prepare the parents and students for the long run.
1/2/24, 11:00 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, if you are planning to save on your own, keeping in mind that you have to make the payment of $1000 in August followed by other payments, may I know what is your plan of preparation for these finances so that you can cater to these smoothly?
1/2/24, 11:02 AM - +263 71 297 5426: I understand
1/2/24, 12:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know! May I please know about this?
1/2/24, 12:28 PM - +263 71 297 5426: How much more will be needed after the $1000 for Aug
1/2/24, 2:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: @kwazi, I need you to understand that, as your admissions officer, I want you to understand that our goal is to help you save $1500 by November so that when Nicole comes to India for her higher education, she does not face any difficulties in terms of finances and after that help you save another $1500 till August 2026 to help you prepare for the remaining years. This will not only ease your challenge of paying the fees in a hefty amount but also help you properly maintain your finances.
1/2/24, 2:46 PM - +263 71 297 5426: I get you sir I will make a plan
2/2/24, 10:59 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Nicole!
I hope you are doing well. I am glad to hear that you are now going to plan the finances in a better way. Please share it here with us as well, so that we can align ourselves accordingly and prepare for the further timelines.
2/2/24, 12:20 PM - +263 71 297 5426: I will let you know about the plan right now am still trying to figure out how am going to go about it
