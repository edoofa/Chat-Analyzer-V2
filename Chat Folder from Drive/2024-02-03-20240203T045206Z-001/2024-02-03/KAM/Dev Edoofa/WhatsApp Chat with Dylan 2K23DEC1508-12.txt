28/12/23, 8:34 AM - Dev Edoofa: This message was deleted
28/12/23, 8:35 AM - Dev Edoofa: It's great to hear that. Also, It is important to note our operational hours, which are from *8:30 am to 4:30 pm as per Central African Time*. All of our sessions will be held in the same time span, and hence, we kindly request that you plan your availability to align with these time slots.

We have thoughtfully scheduled our discussion sessions within these time frames to ensure engaging and productive conversations. May I assume that you have taken note of our designated discussion hours?
28/12/23, 8:37 AM - +263 78 307 2351: Yes I did. So the sessions will be done everyday? From when to when?

28/12/23, 8:48 AM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome. Since this is the first time we are interacting with each other, I'm eager to learn more about Dylan. Could you kindly provide an introduction of Dylan and also share details about your family, sponsor, or guardians who will play a role in shaping Dylan's educational plans? <This message was edited>
28/12/23, 9:04 AM - +263 78 307 2351: Dylan is a boy aged 18. He is a good boy and had a good behavior since his childhood even at school. Since his primary level I do not remember being called at school because Dylan has done cruel things no. He is eager to learn new things and likes correction. He is very sociable and kind. He is not hard to be friendly. At home he helps me with house chores and If I'm with him he helps me a lot. One of his teachers when he was transferring he felt bad because he was his best student. 

I am his mother aged 37. I have 2 children all boys.

His father is Sheperd Nyathi aged 39. He is an Artisan Rigger at Zimbabwe Power Company. He is pushing hard for his children to aim higher education. His father will play a role in shaping Dylan's educational plans. And I will also help him with the money I get from my businesses. I think this all I can say
28/12/23, 9:11 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you Mrs. Nyathi for providing inroduction about Dylan and your family. I truly appreciate it.
28/12/23, 9:11 AM - +263 78 307 2351: Thank you

Your proactive engagement holds significant weight, and if, for any reason, either you or Dylan won't be available, we kindly request you to inform us beforehand so that we can plan and schedule our discussion beforehand. I hope you have taken note of this as well?
28/12/23, 9:13 AM - +263 78 307 2351: Yes I did
28/12/23, 9:16 AM - +263 78 307 2351: As I said earlier Dylan will be back from rural areas to night. I called his grandfather he said Dylan's phone has no power.
28/12/23, 9:17 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is well appreciated and we thank you for informing us!
28/12/23, 9:17 AM - +263 78 307 2351: Welcome

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?

2/1/24, 10:37 AM - Dev Edoofa: it must be sponsor name and relationship instead of scholar. 
In that space, you must write your guardian's name who will be taking responsibility of the finances of your education in India.
2/1/24, 10:37 AM - Dev Edoofa: Great!
2/1/24, 10:38 AM - +263 78 307 2351: Ohh ok l understand

2/1/24, 10:42 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
2/1/24, 10:42 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
2/1/24, 10:44 AM - +263 78 307 2351: Well explained
2/1/24, 10:44 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
2/1/24, 10:45 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
2/1/24, 10:46 AM - +263 78 307 2351: Yes
2/1/24, 10:49 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
2/1/24, 10:49 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

6/1/24, 11:04 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
6/1/24, 11:04 AM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
6/1/24, 11:06 AM - +263 78 307 2351: Yes really
6/1/24, 11:16 AM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
6/1/24, 11:16 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
6/1/24, 11:16 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
6/1/24, 11:16 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
6/1/24, 11:16 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
6/1/24, 11:39 AM - +263 78 307 2351: Absolutely Sir it is a wonderful opportunity
6/1/24, 11:43 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
6/1/24, 11:43 AM - +263 78 307 2351: Yes sure
6/1/24, 11:57 AM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
6/1/24, 12:06 PM - +263 78 307 2351: An incredible opportunity Sir
6/1/24, 12:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
6/1/24, 12:09 PM - +263 78 307 2351: Yes sure
6/1/24, 12:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
6/1/24, 12:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that
6/1/24, 12:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
6/1/24, 12:29 PM - +263 78 307 2351: Yes we agree Sir
6/1/24, 12:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
6/1/24, 12:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
6/1/24, 12:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
6/1/24, 12:41 PM - +263 78 307 2351: Yes it's clear
6/1/24, 12:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
6/1/24, 12:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
6/1/24, 12:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
6/1/24, 12:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
6/1/24, 1:47 PM - +263 78 307 2351: Yes indeed Sir
7/1/24, 9:04 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Dylan!
I hope you all are doing great. Since our operational hours were over yesterday, we were not able take forward our conversation. We will reconnect at 12 pm, to take forward our conversation. Have a wonderful day ahead!
7/1/24, 10:03 AM - +263 78 307 2351: Good morning Sir. Well noted
7/1/24, 12:28 PM - +263 78 307 2351: Good afternoon Sir
8/1/24, 10:36 AM - +263 78 307 2351: Good morning Sir
8/1/24, 10:48 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Dylan!
I hope all of you had a wonderful weekend and are completely ready for this week.
So, if we are ready to proceed with the admission process, shall we start with our session for today?
8/1/24, 10:52 AM - +263 78 307 2351: Yes we may start
8/1/24, 11:11 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!
8/1/24, 11:26 AM - +263 78 307 2351: Sure
8/1/24, 11:32 AM - Dev Edoofa: With regards to our last conversation, we were discussing about the Financial Secure Plan and the challenges parents face while preparing for the finances in Zimbabwe. If you are on the same page with our last conversation, I would like to take forward the discussion and share my thoughts further on the Financial Secur Plan.
8/1/24, 11:34 AM - +263 78 307 2351: Ok Sir
8/1/24, 11:40 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering the constraints that were mentioned in our previous, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
8/1/24, 11:48 AM - +263 78 307 2351: Yes
8/1/24, 11:53 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay by tomorrow before your due date of 25-January-2024.
8/1/24, 11:53 AM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
8/1/24, 11:53 AM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
8/1/24, 11:56 AM - +263 78 307 2351: If l may ask Sir . We need to deposit $150every month
8/1/24, 12:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, Dylan. This will help your parents save a sufficient amount of money for handling your finances for higher education in India.
8/1/24, 12:12 PM - +263 78 307 2351: Ok l understand.
8/1/24, 12:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am delighted I was able to clear your query.
8/1/24, 12:13 PM - +263 78 307 2351: Yes please
8/1/24, 12:13 PM - +263 78 307 2351: Its ok
8/1/24, 12:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
8/1/24, 12:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fee.
8/1/24, 12:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
8/1/24, 12:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
8/1/24, 12:22 PM - +263 78 307 2351: Its all clear. So when finishing the $150 left l will have to go through the Edoofa associate again. Since paying straight with the Edoofa account has charges
8/1/24, 12:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, Dylan. That is absolutely correct. We will help you by providing more modes of payment for your finances and help you determine the most suitable mode of payment for you.
8/1/24, 12:30 PM - +263 78 307 2351: Ok Sir
8/1/24, 12:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, I would like to recommend you take a note of the Financial Secure Plan that is being conveyed to you right now.
8/1/24, 12:34 PM - Dev Edoofa: Shall we move ahead?
8/1/24, 12:45 PM - +263 78 307 2351: Let's move ahead
8/1/24, 12:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
8/1/24, 12:53 PM - +263 78 307 2351: Yes
8/1/24, 12:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
8/1/24, 12:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
8/1/24, 12:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
8/1/24, 12:59 PM - +263 78 307 2351: Its ok, but Sir were l stay we don't have FB bank. e.i Hwange Town Zimbabwe
8/1/24, 1:01 PM - +263 78 307 2351: What about l send money to your associate every time. Then when it's time to withdraw he will send me the money. How is that
8/1/24, 1:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, Dylan. There are various options that can be used to transfer the amount. No need to worry about that. Now, Since, you have time right you can try to open a bank account at FB bank, as it is required to have a bank account for the VISA procedure. I hope you understand.
8/1/24, 1:15 PM - +263 78 307 2351: I do understand Sir. But in my town there is no FB bank
8/1/24, 1:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: No worries, Dylan. We will assist you in opening a bank account at another bank that is present in your town. <This message was edited>
8/1/24, 1:18 PM - +263 78 307 2351: Ok thank you
8/1/24, 1:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now moving forward, Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
8/1/24, 1:22 PM - +263 78 307 2351: So this month since am depositing $150 
 Next month another
8/1/24, 1:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, Dylan. That is absolutely correct.
8/1/24, 1:25 PM - +263 78 307 2351: Ok. So the time will also be before 25 February
8/1/24, 1:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes Dylan.
8/1/24, 1:28 PM - +263 78 307 2351: Ok
8/1/24, 1:28 PM - +263 78 307 2351: We can move on
8/1/24, 1:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know by when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
8/1/24, 1:31 PM - +263 78 307 2351: Let's have our next session tomorrow same time i.e 10am
8/1/24, 1:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you on tomorrow at 10:00am  to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
8/1/24, 1:32 PM - +263 78 307 2351: Thank you. Sir
9/1/24, 10:24 AM - +263 78 307 2351: Good morning Sir
9/1/24, 10:24 AM - +263 78 307 2351: Sir l had a discussion with my parents on the Financial Secure Plan session we had yesterday. My parents are ok with it. They say they are willing to take any risk for me to have a better future and a better career. They are all fine with it , l clearly explained the $150 for the next 10 months. They said they can whatever it takes Sir
9/1/24, 10:24 AM - +263 78 307 2351: Also here in Zimbabwe we have opened schools today. So l think we have to schedule another time for the sessions because at 10am l will be in class. We can schedule from next week Monday. This week there's less learning. Only cleaning of the school is there, so this week we can continue with 10am but Monday 15 January 2024 , our session times have to change. Thank you sir
9/1/24, 10:31 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Dylan!
I hope you are doing well. I completely understand and We don't want to be a hindrance to your education at school as well. So, we will have our session at 2:30pm to move forward with our session.
9/1/24, 10:42 AM - +263 78 307 2351: Thank you for understanding Sir
10/1/24, 11:16 AM - +263 78 307 2351: Good morning Sir
12/1/24, 2:33 PM - +263 78 307 2351: Good afternoon Sir
12/1/24, 2:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Dylan and Parents!
I hope you all are doing great.With great excitement and pride, I want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
12/1/24, 2:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experience. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
12/1/24, 2:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we start our session today, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

20/1/24, 1:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your wishes for my recovery and I am glad that you are doing fine!
20/1/24, 1:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held last week, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
20/1/24, 2:13 PM - +263 78 123 5206: No please explain
21/1/24, 11:44 AM - +263 78 123 5206: Greetings Sir
