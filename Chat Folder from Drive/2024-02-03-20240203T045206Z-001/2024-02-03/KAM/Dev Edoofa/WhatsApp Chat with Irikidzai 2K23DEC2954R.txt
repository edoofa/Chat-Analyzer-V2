26/1/24, 1:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that and I understand!
26/1/24, 1:49 PM - +263 77 619 4524: Thank you for understanding
27/1/24, 7:27 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning @263776194524 @263773201523!
I hope you are doing well. Yesterday, we were not able to take forward our conversation as the forms were not filled, so may I know if the forms are completely filled?
27/1/24, 10:29 AM - +263 77 320 1523: We are working on it
27/1/24, 11:41 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about it. May I know when will you be done with the forms?
27/1/24, 11:44 AM - +263 77 320 1523: Please give us more time. By end of day we will be done
27/1/24, 12:04 PM - +263 77 320 1523: There is a requirement of passport sized photos. Yet Irikidzai is at school. Please help. What do we do
27/1/24, 12:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: May I know if you have any passport-size photo of Irikidzai, which you may have used for any other paperwork?
27/1/24, 12:19 PM - +263 77 320 1523: We do not have any passport sized photos
27/1/24, 12:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: This message was deleted
27/1/24, 12:25 PM - Dev Edoofa: Okay, I understand! Do you have any photo of Irikidzai with light background so that it can be pasted on the form or any other photo of her?
27/1/24, 12:39 PM - +263 77 320 1523: We have her photos yes

29/1/24, 11:45 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning @263773201523 @263776194524!
I hope you are doing well and had a wonderful weekend. May I know if the forms are completely filled out?
29/1/24, 11:46 AM - +263 77 619 4524: Almost we are still sorting out the issues with the passport sized photo
29/1/24, 11:56 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thanks for letting me know. I would recommend you complete the forms on time as we are already lagging behind a little from the timelines, and this can eventually seriously affect Irikidzai's admission journey. I hope you understand?
29/1/24, 11:57 AM - +263 77 619 4524: Thank you,  yes l understand,  we will be in touch soon

Thank you for our sharing the feedback form. However you are yet to fill the EWYL form and student application form. Please do the same as soon as possible!
30/1/24, 11:40 AM - +263 77 619 4524: Noted with thanks
31/1/24, 10:25 AM - +263 77 619 4524: Good morning

31/1/24, 10:35 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning @263776194524 @263773201523!
I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing the EWYL form. However, I noticed that you filled the EWYL program availability and orientation availability dates as the 28th and 29th of March respectively. However, as mentioned above in our previous conversations the initiation dates are going to be from 30th January. May I please ask what is the reason behind writing these dates? It will help us to prepare ourselves accordingly.
31/1/24, 10:37 AM - +263 77 619 4524: It is because Irikidzai is still at school but on the provided dates she will be back home
31/1/24, 10:49 AM - Dev Edoofa: I understand @263776194524 But I believe parents and other family members can also take part in these sessions, to ensure that the student's EWYL sessions are not affected, and she is able to self-finance her education in a smooth way. I hope you understand?
31/1/24, 10:52 AM - +263 77 619 4524: Sorry I am not really understanding,  what do the sessions entail, maybe we may understand better
31/1/24, 11:11 AM - Dev Edoofa: The EWYL sessions also known as the Earn While You Learn program is a program that provides the students with the opportunity to self-finance their higher education here in India. In these sessions, students are asked to work on projects for which they are awarded scholarship credits which are used to self-finance their education. At the same time, the students gain many industry level skills that are prerequisites when you start your career. These sessions help them to become employable-ready. I hope you understand now?
31/1/24, 11:27 AM - Dev Edoofa: Are you clear @263776194524 ?
31/1/24, 11:32 AM - +263 77 619 4524: Yes l understand but  l am not understanding how we can partake in these on her behalf may you shed a bit more light on that
31/1/24, 11:36 AM - Dev Edoofa: For that, parents can help the students by introducing themselves in these sessions and understanding how the sessions are going to be and the way forward. This will help you initiate these sessions and make sure that Irikidzai is not facing any challenges further going on.
31/1/24, 11:45 AM - +263 77 619 4524: Okay noted
31/1/24, 11:49 AM - +263 77 320 1523: OK we will try
31/1/24, 11:55 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! Since, we are late to initiate the EWYL sessions, as it was supposed to start yesterday, we will change the date to 2nd February. You can also now strike off the previously mentioned March dates and write 2nd February instead on the EWYL form and share it here again.
31/1/24, 11:57 AM - +263 77 619 4524: Noted
31/1/24, 11:59 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! Please share the updated form as soon as possible. Till then, may I know if you are available for the further session? <This message was edited>
31/1/24, 12:01 PM - +263 77 619 4524: Yes l am
31/1/24, 12:01 PM - +263 77 619 4524: Noted
31/1/24, 12:02 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
31/1/24, 12:02 PM - +263 77 619 4524: And when will be  the orientation day?
31/1/24, 12:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: You can also write it as 2nd February.
31/1/24, 12:08 PM - +263 77 619 4524: Okay noted
31/1/24, 12:09 PM - +263 77 619 4524: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 12:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the form. I have taken note of it and will update it in our records as well.
31/1/24, 12:11 PM - +263 77 619 4524: Noted with thanks
31/1/24, 12:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: May I know if we can start the discussion?
31/1/24, 12:25 PM - +263 77 619 4524: Yes you may
31/1/24, 12:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 12:27 PM - +263 77 619 4524: Noted
31/1/24, 12:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
31/1/24, 12:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
31/1/24, 12:30 PM - +263 77 619 4524: Yes they are
31/1/24, 12:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps - 

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
31/1/24, 12:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
31/1/24, 12:43 PM - +263 77 619 4524: Noted
31/1/24, 12:43 PM - +263 77 619 4524: Yes l am
31/1/24, 12:43 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
31/1/24, 12:43 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
31/1/24, 12:45 PM - +263 77 619 4524: Yes they are
31/1/24, 12:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
31/1/24, 12:47 PM - +263 77 619 4524: That's okay
31/1/24, 12:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
31/1/24, 12:50 PM - +263 77 619 4524: Yes I am but unfortunately i don't have enough data may I provide feedback on them tomorrow
31/1/24, 12:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: No worries, @263776194524 ! Let me share the videos so that you can watch them later.
31/1/24, 12:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*
