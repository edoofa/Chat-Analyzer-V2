6/1/24, 11:03 AM - +263 71 131 9112: Thanks you very much
We are clear
6/1/24, 11:11 AM - Dev Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:

I hope all of you are doing great. While I was wrapping up my day, I observed that we were not able to have a smooth discussion for the past couple of days, which has led to some delay in the admission process. We are aware of your immense trust in us and we surely care about your future. Considering that in mind, I wanted to schedule a specific session tomorrow at 8:30 am so that we can cover the process we are lagging behind, and ensure that your admission process is on track. I am aware that Tendai is now at school. Hence, I wanted to understand if you as parents/guardians will be available for our session at 8:30am. If not, I would like you to please let me know at what time between 8:30 am to 4 pm will you be available?

9/1/24, 8:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Tendai.

I hope all of you are having a wonderful day. Today I had a meeting with the academic board and I was discussing the current status of your application file and in the same discussion, the team higjlighted that we have been a bit off track for the discusisons we were suppsed to completed and hence I wanted to reach out to you and just reiteratre the agenda of the sessions/discusisons we have in place.
9/1/24, 8:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: The agenda for these sessions is to help you understand the process Tendai will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since Tendai is in school and you are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
9/1/24, 8:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see, our goal is to help you prepare for your child's education abroad, that is something that is going to require a significant time. It requires months of planning. Hence, to do that perfectly and be prepared, as a parent, you would have to contribute an hour daily for at least 10 days so that we can be in sync and make the right decisions.
9/1/24, 8:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: We, at Edoofa, are determined to provide affordable higher education to hardworking students and assist them in launching their careers to greater heights. We will be able to help you only if we can connect timely and have healthy discussions.
9/1/24, 8:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January]. This way, we can align it with our availability as well and help you move forward and make progress in a streamlined manner. Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your inputs and find the right time for our sessions.
9/1/24, 8:18 PM - +263 77 340 7203: Good evening
9/1/24, 8:18 PM - +263 77 340 7203: My day was alright, thank you
9/1/24, 8:18 PM - +263 77 340 7203: I hope you are well too

15/1/24, 2:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tendai!
I hope you are doing great!  Kindly provide me some time to realign my schedule according to your availability and then I will share my confirmation. Till the time, please be patient and allow us some time.
15/1/24, 2:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: Till then, With great excitement and pride, I want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
15/1/24, 2:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experience. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
15/1/24, 2:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we start our session today, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

16/1/24, 3:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
16/1/24, 3:06 PM - +263 77 340 7203: noted, looking forward to the discussion
16/1/24, 3:07 PM - +263 77 340 7203: we can proceed
16/1/24, 3:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 3:24 PM - +263 77 340 7203: please go ahead and explain, i have gone through the image
16/1/24, 3:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
16/1/24, 3:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
16/1/24, 3:36 PM - +263 77 340 7203: yes they are clear
16/1/24, 3:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
16/1/24, 3:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
16/1/24, 3:45 PM - +263 77 340 7203: okay, i am following, so do we have instances were one receives multiple offer letters
16/1/24, 3:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes @263773407203. There can be such kind of instances. Can we now proceed forward with the session?
16/1/24, 3:58 PM - +263 77 340 7203: yes lets proceed
16/1/24, 4:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
16/1/24, 4:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
16/1/24, 4:08 PM - +263 77 340 7203: okay so does the registraation fees differ with universities?
16/1/24, 4:08 PM - +263 77 340 7203: will this mount be used s part of tuition fees or its purely registration fees
16/1/24, 4:10 PM - +263 77 340 7203: will there be  grace period for raising the said funds, for instance after receiving the letter of intent how much time do we hve until the registration fee is due
16/1/24, 4:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, @263773407203. The registration fee differs according to the university.
16/1/24, 4:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: This fee of $500 to $1000 is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first-year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.
16/1/24, 4:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: Please note that this is just a brief understanding of what your admission process holds, you will be explained each and every step in detail as we move forward, I would appreciate you being patient, please.

Now if we are clear shall we move ahead?
16/1/24, 4:21 PM - +263 77 340 7203: perfect, that is what i had heard but just wanted confirmation that we are still on the same page, thank you
16/1/24, 4:22 PM - +263 77 340 7203: okay noted, we can move
16/1/24, 4:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps and  If we are on the same page shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
16/1/24, 4:30 PM - +263 77 340 7203: okay
16/1/24, 4:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
16/1/24, 4:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
16/1/24, 4:47 PM - +263 77 340 7203: Yes please go ahead
16/1/24, 4:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

24/1/24, 5:44 PM - +263 77 340 7203: Thank you
26/1/24, 9:36 AM - +263 77 340 7203: good Morning
26/1/24, 9:48 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Mrs. Sadziwa!
I hope you are doing well and are having a wonderful start to the day. I felt a bit under the weather yesterday, so I took a day off to focus on my health. Today, I am feeling better and completely ready to take our conversation forward. May I know if your are available to take forward our session right now?
26/1/24, 10:05 AM - +263 77 340 7203: I am well thank you. I am glad you are feeling better, please do get well soon.
26/1/24, 10:06 AM - +263 77 340 7203: I am a bit tied up now, but i will be available anytime from 3pm today.
26/1/24, 10:06 AM - +263 77 340 7203: Gentle reminder on the invoice so that we process payment by end of day
26/1/24, 10:08 AM - Dev Edoofa: Okay, @263773407203, I will surely ask the admission team to do so. We will have our session at 3:00 PM today.
26/1/24, 10:09 AM - +263 77 340 7203: Noted, thank you
26/1/24, 3:25 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afetrnoon @263773407203!
I hope you are doing well. May I know if you are ready to take forward our conversation?
26/1/24, 3:26 PM - +263 77 340 7203: Afternoon how are you
26/1/24, 3:26 PM - +263 77 340 7203: yes we can proceed
26/1/24, 3:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: We have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
26/1/24, 3:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelor of Physiotherapy and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
26/1/24, 3:38 PM - +263 77 340 7203: yes thats correct
26/1/24, 3:44 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
26/1/24, 3:44 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
26/1/24, 3:44 PM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
26/1/24, 3:56 PM - +263 77 340 7203: yes, thats true, i would like to know
26/1/24, 4:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
26/1/24, 4:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.
26/1/24, 4:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
26/1/24, 4:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
26/1/24, 4:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
26/1/24, 4:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
26/1/24, 4:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
26/1/24, 4:15 PM - +263 77 340 7203: okay so the Edoofa Financial plan is like an investment vehicle?
26/1/24, 4:25 PM - Dev Edoofa: Not Exactly, let me explain how it works.
26/1/24, 4:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: As you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
26/1/24, 4:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
26/1/24, 4:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
26/1/24, 4:29 PM - +263 77 340 7203: yes thats correct
26/1/24, 4:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
26/1/24, 4:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
26/1/24, 4:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
26/1/24, 4:48 PM - +263 77 340 7203: yes im following
26/1/24, 4:53 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
26/1/24, 4:53 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
26/1/24, 4:53 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
26/1/24, 4:53 PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
26/1/24, 4:55 PM - +263 77 340 7203: yes thats correct
26/1/24, 5:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay by tomorrow before your due date of 26th Jan 2024
26/1/24, 5:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
26/1/24, 5:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
26/1/24, 5:16 PM - +263 77 340 7203: ooh owkay
26/1/24, 5:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
26/1/24, 5:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
26/1/24, 5:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from
26/1/24, 5:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
26/1/24, 5:41 PM - +263 77 340 7203: If we do not go the Edoofa Financial plan at which point does Edoofa admissions team initiate the Child's admission process?
26/1/24, 5:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: So if you do not wish to start with the Edoofa Secure Plan, then your admission process will start from August adn that time you will have to keep the registration fees ready to make sure that you are able to grab a seat. But with this plan, we will reserve your seats early on, and old fee structure will be entitled to you. I hope you understand?
26/1/24, 5:56 PM - +263 77 340 7203: Its an interesting avenue and something that we will consider, unfortunately i cannot make the decision on my own, will share with my father and other sisters then give you feedback since we have been helping each other with the whole issue.
26/1/24, 5:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: Sure but let me tell you about some other aspects that are left to explain.
26/1/24, 5:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
26/1/24, 5:58 PM - +263 77 340 7203: And also if we are going with the plan, is our first installment starting this month?
26/1/24, 5:58 PM - +263 77 340 7203: Yes it is
26/1/24, 6:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: You can start in the month of February if you are not comfortable in paying the amount this month, but it is preferential to pay from this month so that you are able to save $1500 earlier.
26/1/24, 6:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
26/1/24, 6:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
26/1/24, 6:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well.
26/1/24, 6:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
26/1/24, 6:51 PM - +263 77 340 7203: Okay...yes its clear
26/1/24, 8:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you tomorrow to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good night, and please extend our regards to your family.
26/1/24, 8:26 PM - +263 77 340 7203: Thank you so much for your time and detailed explanations. Have a blessed weekend.😊
27/1/24, 11:52 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263773407203!

Please, how are you doing today? With regard to our discussion yesterday, I wanted to reach out and enquire if you are available for us to have a brief conversation?
27/1/24, 11:57 AM - +263 77 340 7203: I am well thank you, how are you
27/1/24, 11:58 AM - +263 77 340 7203: Yes i am available now.
27/1/24, 11:59 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are doing well and are available for us to connect with each other. Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held at the beginning of this month, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
27/1/24, 12:02 PM - +263 77 340 7203: Ummm im not sure if i have come across it.
27/1/24, 12:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is alright, Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
27/1/24, 12:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
27/1/24, 12:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
27/1/24, 12:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let me share a glimpse of the conference with you and your family, I am certain that Tendai too would be this excited to attend such events when she comes to India.
27/1/24, 12:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>

27/1/24, 12:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let me know once you are able to go through the messages about the SLICE CON, along with the images and videos shared with you. This was indeed a momentous step for all of our students, making them employable ready and giving them access to the right opportunities for their careers ahead.
27/1/24, 12:18 PM - +263 77 340 7203: Thank you, let me go through
27/1/24, 12:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: Are you done?
27/1/24, 1:18 PM - +263 77 340 7203: Yes i am
27/1/24, 1:18 PM - +263 77 340 7203: My network is a bit slow today
27/1/24, 1:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: No worries, @263773407203! Regarding the discussion we had the other day about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
27/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 77 340 7203: We discussed briefly about it....let me share by end of day their full questions as we will be finishing and concluding this afternoon. We want to find a way of raising the $150 per month. We were focusing on raising  the 500 to $1000  university registration to happen later on torwards the end of the year so we're trying to see how we can raise the  monthly fee consistantly.
27/1/24, 1:51 PM - +263 77 340 7203: And also weighing on the implications of going without the Edoofa financial plan.
27/1/24, 1:52 PM - +263 77 340 7203: So the discussion process is still on but i think by end of day we would have made a decision.
27/1/24, 2:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: Sure, that is perfectly fine, @263773407203. You can discuss and share your queries here. I wanted to tell you that you need to save $1500 by the month of November which is 10 months from now so that you can save the said amount and not face any financial constraints at the time of admission into universities. 
And for the second one, if you choose not to engage with this plan, then you will have to cater to the finances at the time of admission which may become hectic. You may also miss out on the added advantage of reserved seats before the admissions start in the universities, and you may not be entitled to pay the tuition fees according to the old fee structure if the fee structure of the university is revised. Most importantly if you have poor preparation of finances then Tendai may face some some roadblocks in securing her seat at the university. 

I hope you have the right mindset now regarding the plan?
27/1/24, 2:55 PM - +263 77 340 7203: What if we manage to have the $1500 by the stipulated time when it is needed, how will we miss on the reserved seats option.....is it an option only mearnt for those who would have engaged in the Financial plan?
27/1/24, 3:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: So the stipulated time is till November. If you manage to save $1500 till that time by following the secure plan, then we will initiate Tendai's admission process by applying early to the universities to secure scholarships and university seats. Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a higher scholarship. 

Now if you are not engaged in the financial plan then Tendai's admission process will be initiated later in the year during August and hence she will miss out on the added benefits. I hope I was able to clear your query?
27/1/24, 3:26 PM - +263 77 340 7203: Not quite clear but let me have all the questions then we can further discuss.
27/1/24, 3:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: there is a correction here, if you engage in the edoofa financial secure plan, then we will initiate Tendai's admission process early. I hope that you take note of it?
27/1/24, 3:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: Sure, @263773407203! That's completely fine.
27/1/24, 3:31 PM - +263 77 340 7203: Okay
27/1/24, 3:32 PM - +263 77 340 7203: We will take note...thank you
27/1/24, 3:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome!
29/1/24, 8:40 AM - +263 77 340 7203: Good Morning Mr. Kumar
29/1/24, 8:41 AM - +263 77 340 7203: I hope you enjoyed your weekend and had a great start to your week
29/1/24, 8:41 AM - +263 77 340 7203: We managed to discuss with my family on the Edoofa Financial plan option.
29/1/24, 8:44 AM - +263 77 340 7203: Unfortunately we will not be able to participate in the plan, reasons being, our finances are not quite stable at the moment and we are still paying Tendai's fees and for us to add $150 to that budget currently is a bit straining. Our fear is we may be able to pay for this month and next month but will be difficult in March since we would want to raise her termly fees and we may end up defaulting which will derail the whole plan so we have resolved that we will work with raising funds for August.
29/1/24, 12:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning @263773407203!
I hope you are doing well and had a wonderful weekend. I am glad that you were able to discuss the Plan with your family in detail and I completely understand your genuine concern. However, I wanted to help you understand, that 20-30% of students who enroll in the Edoofa Scholarship Program, every year are unable to come to India due to poor preparation of Finances. To solve this recurrence, Edoofa designed the Edoofa Secure Plan to ensure that students should not be able to let go of the golden opportunity to grow just because of poor preparation finances. I understand the financial constraints that you may have in the future, but I also believe that you want to see Tendai become a successful individual in her respective field of study and moreover, life. The purpose of this plan is to help the parents save $1500 at the end of 10 months, i.e. November. This will greatly help the parents to ensure that their children can grab seats before other students as well as help the parents to prepare for the finances for the whole year and, not to forget the added benefits that were mentioned above. I hope understand what I am trying to convey?
29/1/24, 12:33 PM - +263 77 340 7203: i am well thank you.
29/1/24, 12:37 PM - +263 77 340 7203: Yes i totally understand were you are coming from, our only challenge is that of our cashflows and fear that we embark on the plan and end up defaulting on some of the months, challenge being if we had known earlier like last year when we started the process we would have put provisions in place to assist. so all along we were working with raising $350 registration to Edoofa and the 500 to 1000 needed for university registration and we thought this would be needed by end of year or probably begining of next year which works well for us because committing $150 now to other additional monthly commitments that we have may be a challenge which may make us struggle paying on some of the months.
29/1/24, 12:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: I have taken note of it and understand it completely as well. May I know how are you planning to save the amount of registration fees? This well help us to align ourselves and help you tackle the challenges as well.
29/1/24, 1:23 PM - +263 77 340 7203: it will be coming from our salaries, but not having a stipulated monthly amount to save.
29/1/24, 3:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thanks for letting me know. But I want to understand that since it is not a stipulated amount that you are going to save every month, in the end, you will have to pay the registration fee as well as the first-semester fee of Tendai anyhow, so how are you planning to tackle the situation if you are not able to save that much?
29/1/24, 4:03 PM - +263 77 340 7203: so we will definitely be setting aside some funds, the only difference is on amount and consistancy, in this case you were proposing that we start paying now but as of now our cashflows are not that good such that we fear that we may pay $150 this month and next month then probably fail in March and April. so saving and keeping the funds ourselves will not give us too much pressure.
30/1/24, 10:53 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning @263773407203!
I hope you are doing well. Thank you for letting me know about your strategies, but may I know what is your back up strategy if you fail to prepare a sufficient amount with the above strategy mentioned because there has to be another way in such kind of situations as it risks the future of your children. I hope you understand my concern?
30/1/24, 10:55 AM - +263 77 340 7203: Good Morning
30/1/24, 10:55 AM - +263 77 340 7203: I am very well, thank you.
30/1/24, 10:55 AM - +263 77 340 7203: i hope you are well too
30/1/24, 11:03 AM - +263 77 340 7203: if we fail to raise the expected funds within the stipulated time we will resolve to taking a loan from the bank, but i doubt that we will get to that as we have been managing with our saving system.
30/1/24, 3:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad that you have a saving system through which you are planning to save the amount at the time. May I please ask you to share this saving system? As it will help us to plan the further timelines and admission process accordingly.
30/1/24, 3:56 PM - +263 77 340 7203: we use the safe deposit box, it is difficult to trust and investment vehicle or banks in Zimbabwe these days.
30/1/24, 9:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting us know, @263773407203! We will continue our discussion tomorrow. Till then for the payment of the remaining enrollment fee, I am sharing with you the invoice link that you requested:

I hope you are doing well. Yes, that is the correct amount.

Oooh i thought the amount is $350 which was supposed to be paid in 2 instalments of $200 and $150.
31/1/24, 4:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, that is true, @263773407203. But due to the transfer charges of 10%, you hav to pay the above amount so that we receive $150. I hope you are clear now?
