8/1/24, 8:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Astra!
I hope all of you are doing great. While I was wrapping up my day, I observed that we were not able to have a smooth discussion for the past couple of days, which has led to some delay in the admission process. We are aware of your immense trust in us and we surely care about your future. Considering that in mind, I wanted to schedule a specific session tomorrow at 8:30 am so that we can cover the process we are lagging behind,  and ensure that your admission process is on track. Hence, I wanted to understand if you will be available for our session at 8:30am. If not, I would like you to please let me know at what time between 8:30 am to 4 pm will you be available?
9/1/24, 10:17 AM - Dev Edoofa: Shall we start with our session?
9/1/24, 8:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Astra.

I hope all of you are having a wonderful day. Today I had a meeting with the academic board and I was discussing the current status of your application file and in the same discussion, the team higjlighted that we have been a bit off track for the discusisons we were suppsed to completed and hence I wanted to reach out to you and just reiteratre the agenda of the sessions/discusisons we have in place.
9/1/24, 8:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: The agenda for these sessions is to help you understand the process Astra will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since Astra is in school and you are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
9/1/24, 8:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see, our goal is to help you prepare for your child's education abroad, that is something that is going to require a significant time. It requires months of planning. Hence, to do that perfectly and be prepared, as a parent, you would have to contribute an hour daily for at least 10 days so that we can be in sync and make the right decisions.
9/1/24, 8:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: We, at Edoofa, are determined to provide affordable higher education to hardworking students and assist them in launching their careers to greater heights. We will be able to help you only if we can connect timely and have healthy discussions.
9/1/24, 8:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January]. This way, we can align it with our availability as well and help you move forward and make progress in a streamlined manner. Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your inputs and find the right time for our sessions.
10/1/24, 6:16 PM - +263 71 905 3634: Greetings
10/1/24, 6:25 PM - +263 71 905 3634: Because of the nature of my job.I can not simply say, I will be free what time ,Because during the day I will be out in the field  where by they is no proper network but I will answer your questions ,where ever is possible
12/1/24, 3:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263719053634!

15/1/24, 2:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: Till then, With great excitement and pride, I want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
15/1/24, 2:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experience. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
15/1/24, 2:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we start our session today, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
29/1/24, 10:05 AM - Dev Edoofa: Shall we move ahead?
29/1/24, 10:05 AM - +263 71 905 3634: Yes we can start
29/1/24, 10:08 AM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 10:13 AM - +263 71 905 3634: I am done proceed
29/1/24, 10:18 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
29/1/24, 10:18 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
29/1/24, 10:24 AM - +263 71 905 3634: Yes very clear. So the stage one we will expect videos from your admin right?.

And stage 2 will it be a written document with given structure which Astra will write to you but on a given format?
29/1/24, 10:28 AM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, @263719053634. You are somewhat correct but I will tell you about the steps in detail when we reach them. Till that time I would suggest you to pay attention to how the journey of Astra's admission is going to look like. Shall we move forward?
29/1/24, 10:35 AM - +263 71 905 3634: Noted let's proceed
29/1/24, 10:39 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps - 

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
29/1/24, 10:39 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
29/1/24, 10:46 AM - +263 71 905 3634: Do you mind explaining Further the financial secure plan so that we may understand  well and weigh it's Pros and Cons
29/1/24, 10:55 AM - +263 71 905 3634: The stage 4 l am following. Ok this means that offer letter will come after some rigorous evaluation from different Universities and the one that Make it Valid will provide offer letter ?
29/1/24, 10:55 AM - Dev Edoofa: It is a plan that we have designed to help parents prepare for their finances beforehand so that at the moment, the students do not face any roadblocks when they are due to come to India and can pursue higher education here. Also, Mr. Totamirepi, I want to iterate that for the time being, I would suggest you take note of the steps and focus on the journey. We will soon let you know about these steps when the time is right, so that you are not overwhelmed by information and eventually confusion. I hope you understand?
29/1/24, 10:59 AM - +263 71 905 3634: Understood Noted
29/1/24, 11:00 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).

1/2/24, 5:48 PM - +263 71 905 3634: Good Evening sir
1/2/24, 5:49 PM - +263 71 905 3634: Noted
2/2/24, 1:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263719053634!
I hope you are doing well. May I know if you are available to take forward Astra's admission journey? Astra can complete the tasks whenever she is available. This will ensure that Astra's admission process is not affected.
2/2/24, 3:27 PM - +263 71 905 3634: Yes we can carry forward the conversation.
2/2/24, 3:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! We can now to progress to the third step in your admission journey, i.e. *Introduction to Financial Secure Plan*.
2/2/24, 3:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course Astra has selected for her higher education is B.Sc (Medical Lab Technology) and it's my understanding that she is planning to arrive in India in August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate? <This message was edited>
2/2/24, 3:37 PM - +263 71 905 3634: Very accurate thus it and the program is correct
2/2/24, 3:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
2/2/24, 3:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
2/2/24, 3:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
2/2/24, 3:56 PM - +263 71 905 3634: Yes l wish to learn more on the advantages and disadvantages as well as the nature of this financial Plan
2/2/24, 3:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
2/2/24, 3:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
2/2/24, 3:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
2/2/24, 3:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
2/2/24, 3:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
2/2/24, 3:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
2/2/24, 4:03 PM - +263 71 905 3634: We  may wish to have that but what is the nature or this plan since the benefits have been received
2/2/24, 4:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that let me help you with it. As you are aware, we are currently in February 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
2/2/24, 4:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
2/2/24, 4:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
2/2/24, 4:20 PM - +263 71 905 3634: Yes l understand that
2/2/24, 5:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
2/2/24, 5:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
2/2/24, 5:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
2/2/24, 5:27 PM - +263 71 905 3634: I am seeing it. So still what is the nature of the Edoofa Financial Secure plan
2/2/24, 5:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: Could help me by elaborating more on your question?
2/2/24, 5:56 PM - +263 71 905 3634: I understand all you have said but the nature of financial secure plan for Edoofa how is it like? You mean l calculate the money needed for the education and the budget to Edoofa scheme every month till the time or l just save at Home as advised?
2/2/24, 6:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: You need to save the amount with Edoofa because that will only mean that the plan is secure. I hope you understand and please allow me to move forward as the queries that arise in your mind will surely be cleared.
2/2/24, 6:34 PM - +263 71 905 3634: Go ahead
