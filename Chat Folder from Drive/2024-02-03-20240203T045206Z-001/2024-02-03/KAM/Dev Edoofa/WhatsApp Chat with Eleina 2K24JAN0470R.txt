This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.

16/1/24, 5:44 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end.

I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in her achievements and be dedicated to ensuring access to the finest opportunities to launch Eleina's career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?

23/1/24, 12:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is good to know! Shall we start with our session now?
23/1/24, 12:28 PM - +263 77 690 5451: Yes let us proceed
23/1/24, 12:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! May I know if you were able to go through the above picture?
23/1/24, 12:30 PM - +263 77 690 5451: Yes we did
23/1/24, 12:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
23/1/24, 12:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
23/1/24, 12:41 PM - +263 77 690 5451: Very clear sir.
23/1/24, 12:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
23/1/24, 12:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
23/1/24, 12:51 PM - +263 77 690 5451: Yes
23/1/24, 12:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
23/1/24, 12:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
23/1/24, 12:53 PM - +263 77 690 5451: Following
23/1/24, 12:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
23/1/24, 12:57 PM - +263 77 690 5451: We can go ahead
23/1/24, 1:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
23/1/24, 1:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?

23/1/24, 3:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: Eleina, I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes if you have a smooth internet connection.

I hope you are doing well and are having a wonderful start to the day. I felt a bit under the weather yesterday, so I took a day off to focus on my health. Today, I am feeling better and completely ready to take our conversation forward. I completely understand the network challenges you are facing. I am glad that you were able to watch the videos.
26/1/24, 9:10 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move Eleina's application ahead and help Eleina to write a proper statement of purpose so that she can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on Eleina's application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, we would require Eleina's availability for approximately 30 minutes. If she is unavailable, she can provide you with her input, and you can proceed with the statement of purpose on her behalf.
26/1/24, 9:11 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in Ashley's admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

27/1/24, 7:50 AM - +263 77 269 9902: Good morning i am on my way to the boarding school to try and getcauthority to have Eleina home to sign for  the rquirements.

27/1/24, 7:56 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, but you can just get on a call with Eleina to get her responses for the above form so that you can fill it out on her behalf. You don't need any signature for it. It will take you only a few minutes. There is no need to bring her home for her boarding to fill this form.
27/1/24, 7:59 AM - +263 77 269 9902: Good morning as indicated above earlier these boarding schools do not allow phones or visits without appointments that is why i have decided to go in person
27/1/24, 8:00 AM - +263 77 269 9902: For issues that require the child i suggest we do those when she closes school,i stand to be corrected though

29/1/24, 12:26 PM - +263 77 269 9902: Good morning we are ready for the session
29/1/24, 12:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!
29/1/24, 12:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for providing the screenshot of the filled SOP form. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
29/1/24, 12:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: However, before we start the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
30/1/24, 12:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Eleina!
I hope you are doing well. I want to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Since there was a delay in initiating the EWYL program, the EWYL team is prepared to initiate your EWYL program today, i.e. 30th January. 

To kick-start the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:
30/1/24, 12:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: https://chat.whatsapp.com/FVgoqzlHMNK1MktSE6voRB

"Use the above-provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Eleina Mapengo, and my EWYL group name is Eleina EWYL23E1177. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on 30/01/2024 to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*"
30/1/24, 12:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
30/1/24, 12:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: I hope these instructions are clear? If yes, you can start with it as well.
30/1/24, 12:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, may I get an update on this?
31/1/24, 1:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mr. and Mrs. Mapengo
I hope you are doing well. I was expecting a response from your end the past couple of days and hence I wanted to reach out to you once again and see if we are still connected.
31/1/24, 2:15 PM - +263 77 269 9902: Good afternoon we are fully prepared on this matter,apologies for a late response
31/1/24, 2:33 PM - +263 77 690 5451: Good afternoon.
31/1/24, 4:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mr. and Mrs. Mapengo. 
I am glad to receive a reply from you though I was in a meeting at the time you replied. <This message was edited>
31/1/24, 4:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: May I know if you are ready to take forward our conversation?
31/1/24, 4:19 PM - +263 77 690 5451: Ready sir
31/1/24, 4:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: That's great!
31/1/24, 4:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course Eleina has selected for your higher education is BA (Journalism and Mass Communication) and it's my understanding that she is planning to arrive in India in August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate? <This message was edited>
31/1/24, 4:27 PM - +263 77 269 9902: Yes sir that is correct
31/1/24, 4:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
31/1/24, 4:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
31/1/24, 4:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
31/1/24, 4:33 PM - +263 77 269 9902: Sure please share the details with us
31/1/24, 4:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
31/1/24, 4:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
31/1/24, 4:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
31/1/24, 4:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
31/1/24, 4:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
31/1/24, 4:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
31/1/24, 4:38 PM - +263 77 269 9902: It sounds good please elaborate the options for decision purposes
31/1/24, 4:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
31/1/24, 4:41 PM - +263 77 690 5451: Sure
31/1/24, 4:41 PM - +263 77 269 9902: True sir
31/1/24, 4:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
31/1/24, 4:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
31/1/24, 4:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
31/1/24, 4:51 PM - +263 77 690 5451: Very clear.and true
31/1/24, 4:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
31/1/24, 4:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
31/1/24, 4:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
31/1/24, 4:53 PM - +263 77 269 9902: Yes this sounds a good plan
31/1/24, 4:53 PM - +263 77 269 9902: We will have a discussion around this idea dafinately
31/1/24, 5:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
31/1/24, 5:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
31/1/24, 5:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
31/1/24, 5:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
1/2/24, 8:03 AM - +263 77 269 9902: True that is the current zimbabwean situation
1/2/24, 11:53 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Mr.&Mrs. Mapengo!
I hope you are doing well. Yesterday, since our operational hours were over at the time you replied, I was not able to take forward the conversation. May I know if you are ready to take forward our conversation?
1/2/24, 11:54 AM - +263 77 690 5451: Good morning sir.
Ready for nw
1/2/24, 11:58 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, picking up our conversation from yesterday,  considering the above mentioned constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
1/2/24, 12:00 PM - +263 77 690 5451: Sure sir
1/2/24, 12:02 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay before your due date of February 11, 2024.
1/2/24, 12:02 PM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
1/2/24, 12:02 PM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
1/2/24, 1:09 PM - +263 77 269 9902: Could you please state all the options and numbers and timelines on a summary diagram for decision purposes.i feel this will speed up the session and help with decision making since you have indicated that we are behind the schedule.thank you
1/2/24, 1:25 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad, Mr. Mapengo, that you want to cover up for the delays, but Mr. Mapengo, I want you to understand that this is one of the most important parts of the admission journey. If we rush the information that is being conveyed to you, you may get confused and it may delay the process more. So, I want you to focus on this part attentively. I hope you understand what I am trying to convey?
1/2/24, 2:39 PM - +263 77 269 9902: Noted sir thank you we can proceed
1/2/24, 2:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! May I know if this question arises in your mind?
1/2/24, 3:05 PM - +263 77 269 9902: Yes it does
1/2/24, 3:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
1/2/24, 3:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
1/2/24, 3:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
1/2/24, 3:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
2/2/24, 12:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mr. & Mrs.Mapengo!
I hope you are doing well. I was looking forward to a reply from your side. May I know if you were able to go through the above messages and are available to move forward with the conversation?
2/2/24, 12:59 PM - +263 77 269 9902: Good afternoon .we went through the messages and understood.The scheme sounds very good and surely if executed well it will ease pressure on us .please proceed
2/2/24, 1:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! Let's continue our conversation.
2/2/24, 1:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
2/2/24, 3:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: Are you available @263772699902 @263776905451?
2/2/24, 4:56 PM - +263 77 269 9902: Yes i am following
2/2/24, 4:57 PM - +263 77 269 9902: I am available we are both at work with limited attention my apology for that
2/2/24, 5:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: I understand Mr. and Mrs. Mapengo!
2/2/24, 5:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
2/2/24, 5:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
2/2/24, 5:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well.

Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan.
