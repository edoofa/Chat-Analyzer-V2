I firmly believe that with the commencement of this new year, comes the promise of fresh beginnings, guiding the way for the actualization of one's deepest dreams and aspirations. As we stand on the threshold of this promising year, I am filled with excitement for the adventures it holds.
6/1/24, 1:29 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the same spirit, I would like to share that I am embarking on a journey as I prepare myself to pursue my doctorate and take a step forward in my academic pursuits. This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.
6/1/24, 1:29 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The decision to transition to a new phase in my life presents an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of students, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience remain enriched and fulfilling.

As I embark on this new journey, I want to assure you that I have entrusted your application file to capable hands. From this point forward, your admission journey will be seamlessly guided by one of our accomplished admission officers, *Ms. Siddhi,* who will connect with you on Tuesday.  I hope you will make yourself available for further procedures and will give your best to your career.
6/1/24, 1:29 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments. Wish you all the best, and God Bless.

Regards,
Mr. Shiveet
Edoofa Admission Team.
6/1/24, 1:33 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Good afternoon , okay well noted, thank you for everything you have done for us as a family
8/1/24, 1:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kailler,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honoured to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
8/1/24, 1:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
8/1/24, 1:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 1:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
8/1/24, 5:03 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Good afternoon okay well noted thank you
8/1/24, 5:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your response.

A new year brings forth a multitude of possibilities and fresh opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practice more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?
8/1/24, 5:57 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Im looking forward to start my university , new environment, meet new people and have new experience
9/1/24, 9:02 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am so glad to hear that. Absolutely, meeting new people in a new environment and having new experiences bring about learning, and with learning comes transformative changes that offer the opportunity for personal growth and success. I am looking forward to you exploring all the adventures that lie ahead of you.
9/1/24, 9:02 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, I would like to shift focus to your admission process. As per your application file, it seems that you were unable to proceed with your admission formalities scheduled for August 2024. Since a few months have passed, and this is our first interaction, I would like to inquire why you were unable to do so and if now is the right time for you to focus on your university admission journey for higher education abroad.
9/1/24, 9:08 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Good morning , so I wrote my Alevel last year and looking forward for the results this month of January so I'm still waiting for the offer letters because haven't received any as of yet so I think I'm just waiting for them and I'm already waiting to move forward and since we need time to prepare for alot of things to start my university level I'm just hoping I receive the offer letters qs soon as possible , move to the next stage and finish this admission processes with visa processing and start preparing for my new chapter of life
9/1/24, 9:24 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand Kailler, thank you for sharing that information with me.

That is good to hear that you are now available to take the process forward in order to ensure that you secure a scholarship seat in the best university for your higher education. I believe there must have been some misunderstanding that caused your application process to not move ahead. However, I am relieved that we are connected now in order to take it forward.

According to my records, we have completed 3 out of 6 steps for your admission process, i.e., up until Statement of Purpose and Counselling Session on University Admission. Am I correct?
9/1/24, 9:30 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes that's is correct
9/1/24, 9:34 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes and was told was going to receive an offer letters if not mistaken last week and still waiting
9/1/24, 9:54 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that dear. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
9/1/24, 9:58 AM - +263 78 010 5235: So basically everything have been well explained to me and I'm aware of it , the only thing that is stressing me out is that the person who will be paying part of my fees which is not covered by the scholarship wants to know at the beginning of the season the total amount that will be , and the admission fee I have to pay , and the amount for the visa so as to budget accordingly since it's this year I have to be there in India and they are sponsoring alot of students so need to know the total amount of costs so as to budget effectively
9/1/24, 10:24 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright, dear. Please do not worry. I believe Mr. Shivjeet had explained to you that the cost of your higher education will range from $2000 to $3000, am I correct?
9/1/24, 10:25 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes I'm aware of that
9/1/24, 10:49 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
9/1/24, 10:49 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
9/1/24, 10:50 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes I'm aware of this
9/1/24, 10:50 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: So, I suggest that you budget your finances accordingly, as the final fee-breakdown can only be handed over to you after the University sends out your Offer Letter. Are you following?
9/1/24, 10:50 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes I am
9/1/24, 10:52 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In order to reach that stage, we need to first move ahead with your application process. First, I would like to ask you to share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
9/1/24, 10:53 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Okay but I did sent these documents though
9/1/24, 10:54 AM - +263 78 010 5235: <Media omitted>
9/1/24, 10:54 AM - +263 78 010 5235: <Media omitted>
9/1/24, 10:54 AM - +263 78 010 5235: <Media omitted>
9/1/24, 10:54 AM - +263 78 010 5235: <Media omitted>
9/1/24, 11:10 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that information with me. I believe there must have been a misunderstanding. Please be rest assured that your documents have been duly noted by me. 

Do you wish to move forward with the application process now?
9/1/24, 1:12 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes please
9/1/24, 1:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
9/1/24, 1:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
9/1/24, 1:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
9/1/24, 1:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
9/1/24, 2:41 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Okay thank you really looking forward to this offer letters and continue with my journey
9/1/24, 2:41 PM - +263 78 010 5235: And be in this picture this year
9/1/24, 2:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, indeed Kailler. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
9/1/24, 2:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.
9/1/24, 2:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
9/1/24, 2:49 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Okay thank you, really looking forward to get through
9/1/24, 2:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad, Kailler. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
9/1/24, 2:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
9/1/24, 2:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
9/1/24, 2:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
9/1/24, 2:55 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes I have reviewed them and we Did discussed about them one by one
9/1/24, 2:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I believe you are confusing the fee-breakup discussion with the Endowment Program discussion. Let me help you understand the difference better.  Let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
9/1/24, 2:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
9/1/24, 2:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
9/1/24, 3:00 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Oky noted
9/1/24, 3:01 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Okay that's good well noted
9/1/24, 3:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
9/1/24, 3:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
9/1/24, 3:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
9/1/24, 3:17 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Oky thank you and we'll noted
9/1/24, 3:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
9/1/24, 3:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
9/1/24, 3:23 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes everything is clear
9/1/24, 3:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
9/1/24, 3:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
9/1/24, 3:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $450 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
9/1/24, 3:24 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes I'm following every detail
9/1/24, 3:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
9/1/24, 3:28 PM - +263 78 010 5235: I think you can help me out
9/1/24, 3:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
9/1/24, 3:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
9/1/24, 3:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
9/1/24, 3:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
9/1/24, 3:30 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes all clear now thank you
9/1/24, 3:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
9/1/24, 4:58 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes that is true
9/1/24, 4:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
9/1/24, 5:00 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes that I clear
9/1/24, 5:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
9/1/24, 5:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
9/1/24, 5:10 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Okay thank is fine
9/1/24, 5:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
9/1/24, 5:14 PM - +263 78 010 5235: This is a good offer
9/1/24, 5:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
9/1/24, 5:14 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes I'm
9/1/24, 5:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
9/1/24, 5:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
9/1/24, 5:16 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Okay well noted
9/1/24, 5:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
9/1/24, 5:20 PM - +263 78 010 5235: No everything is clear
9/1/24, 5:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright, with this, we can conclude our conversation today. Are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 69 students have already secured their seats, leaving 31 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Abigail is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
9/1/24, 5:22 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Thank you, yes I am
9/1/24, 5:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate your application after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
9/1/24, 5:27 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Okay thank you
10/1/24, 11:18 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Good morning

13/1/24, 9:06 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly. 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
13/1/24, 9:39 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Good morning okay
13/1/24, 9:46 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Thank you
13/1/24, 9:47 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
13/1/24, 9:47 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
13/1/24, 9:48 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes thank you
13/1/24, 9:56 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
13/1/24, 9:56 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is your annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
13/1/24, 10:37 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Oky I have gone through
13/1/24, 10:44 AM - +263 78 010 5235: 1=3000
2=0
3=1250
4=125
5=575
13/1/24, 10:47 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I would like to make a small correction over here, dear. For the 1st question, your per annum tuition fee after scholarship is $0, as you have 100% scholarship. <This message was edited>
13/1/24, 10:48 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Okay thank you
13/1/24, 10:49 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: And for the 4th question, the *Sports and Misc. Fee (One-time payable)* are 2 different components, i.e., column H and column I. Hence, the total of both components will be $250. I hope I am clear?
13/1/24, 10:49 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes have noted that
13/1/24, 10:50 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: For the 5th question, your admission and processing fee will be $1000 i.e., column (J). I believe you confused the same with column (B) i.e., University infra/admin fee. I hope I am clear?
13/1/24, 10:51 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Oky okay
13/1/24, 11:06 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Oky so all In all are we saying I have a total cost of $2550 , which it summed up by adding up the total of $1250+(125+125+1000)
13/1/24, 11:07 AM - +263 78 010 5235: And if yes will I be paying this yearly or there will be some adjustments of removing some cost for instance admission fee of $575
13/1/24, 11:08 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Allow me to explain it to you. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $0
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
13/1/24, 11:08 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1250.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1250 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1500.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1250. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
13/1/24, 11:08 AM - +263 78 010 5235: And sir have a question is it possible for me to change my degree to economist
13/1/24, 11:09 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know the reason behind this shift in decision?
13/1/24, 11:10 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Oky well noted thank you
13/1/24, 11:11 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Okay so have realized I'm good in economics and I'm fond of the subject that is if it's possible but if not it's fine
13/1/24, 11:13 AM - +263 78 010 5235: So I have a total cost of $1500 for my first year how much am I obligated to pay before coming to India
13/1/24, 11:17 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I will need to consult with the academic board regarding the same. But first, I will need you to be sure of this switch you are about to make.
13/1/24, 11:18 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is correct. Before coming to India, you have to pay the registration fee amount i.e., $1000.
13/1/24, 11:18 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Oky but only if possible if not possible it's fine or if it will reduce my scholarship percentage then it's fine
13/1/24, 11:20 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Okay so I pay up $1000 , then the other 500 wil have to pay  it when I will be there , and also the 1000 how much am I supposed to pay to secure my seat at the University first and within what due date
13/1/24, 11:21 AM - +263 78 010 5235: And also from my $1000 , will mu EWYL credits be included
13/1/24, 11:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As we move forward in our discussion today, the majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well.
13/1/24, 11:34 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
13/1/24, 11:34 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make his/her education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
13/1/24, 11:34 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Okay
13/1/24, 11:36 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Oky have gone through the messages , yes we  can move forward
13/1/24, 11:45 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1500, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
13/1/24, 11:45 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
13/1/24, 11:47 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Okay well noted
13/1/24, 11:48 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
13/1/24, 11:49 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $1250. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1250 - $1000 = $250, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
13/1/24, 11:49 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
13/1/24, 11:59 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Wow this is amazing
13/1/24, 12:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
13/1/24, 12:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1500 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $850 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
13/1/24, 12:03 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes it is
13/1/24, 12:04 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Thank you
13/1/24, 12:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: A slight correction, it will give you a total of $500 for the rest of your university fees.
13/1/24, 12:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Please take a note of it.
13/1/24, 12:26 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Oky well noted
13/1/24, 12:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to see that your financial preparations are in place. I hope you recall that the per annum cost of education and the registration fee figures you mentioned were supposed to face a range of $2,000 to $3,000 for the annual cost of education and a registration fee between $500 and $1000.
13/1/24, 12:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, based on the discussions we had with your career counselor and their assessment of your application, they encouraged us to secure a higher quantum of scholarship for you. This is the reason the per annum cost of education is only $1250, which is significantly less than the general cost of education fee range ($2000 to $3000).
13/1/24, 12:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: When you look at this opportunity, with a higher quantum of scholarship, the registration fee may also appear a bit higher. Rest assured, this does not increase your financial burden, as it is an integral part of your first year of education cost and will be utilized for the same purpose. I hope this makes sense?
13/1/24, 12:31 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes well noted thank you
13/1/24, 12:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In continuation of our discussion, I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for you is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that you will find a more affordable and high-quality education. 

Certainly, there are other universities that may assess your scholarship qualifications, and with those, the cost of education may fall within the specified range I mentioned earlier.
13/1/24, 12:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $850 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?
13/1/24, 12:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It's essential to consider the big picture and the overall financial benefits that come with the scholarship offer you have received. Do you not agree with this?
13/1/24, 12:36 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes I do agree
13/1/24, 12:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Glad to see we share the same perspective. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1,500. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you  arrive in India will be $1,500 - $1,000 = $500 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
13/1/24, 12:56 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Okay
13/1/24, 12:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as January 26th, 2024*.
13/1/24, 12:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
13/1/24, 12:59 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Oky have been told to ask thay the total cost is $1500 so  if this cost will include visa cost or not
13/1/24, 1:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Visa and flight ticket costs are not included dear.
13/1/24, 1:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
13/1/24, 1:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $900 of the registration fee. This $900 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $450 before the first deadline date of *26 January, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $450 before the second deadline date of *26 February, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
13/1/24, 1:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $900 within 15 working days, before 26 January, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
13/1/24, 1:12 PM - +263 78 010 5235: What really I don't think if I can make the due date. To raise  all the total amount
13/1/24, 1:15 PM - +263 78 010 5235: But will definitely try to
13/1/24, 1:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because of the $100 grant. You are required to make a payment of $1000 - $100 = $900 within 15 days i.e., by 26 January 2024.

In lieu of the Endowment Program benefits, you can alternatively choose to pay in 2 installments:

1. Payment of $450 by *26 January 2024*
2. Payment of rest $450 by *26 February 2024*
13/1/24, 1:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I hope I am clear?
13/1/24, 1:16 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes you are
13/1/24, 1:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As my operational hours for the day are coming to an end soon, I would like to schedule our next session for Monday at 8:30 AM to discuss the modes of payment. I hope that timing is suitable for you?
13/1/24, 1:31 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Oky thank you
13/1/24, 2:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well. Until then, take care and have a blessed rest of the day!
13/1/24, 2:53 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Thank you
13/1/24, 8:03 PM - +263 78 010 5235: I would be happy  if a get q degree in environmental economics
15/1/24, 10:12 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Good morning
16/1/24, 8:48 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good morning, parents and Kailler. How are you doing today?
16/1/24, 8:48 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Good morning thank you
16/1/24, 9:49 AM - +263 78 010 5235: So I had found $450 but the person who is paying said he wants to know if my degree can be changed
16/1/24, 9:56 AM - +263 77 319 8424: I'm doing well.how are you
16/1/24, 12:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am unable to understand your query, dear. Could you kindly elaborate? Do you wish to change your course?
16/1/24, 1:05 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes sir I want an economic degree
16/1/24, 6:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well, Kailler. I will need to inform my team of the same and I will get back to you tomorrow. May you please suggest a suitable time for our session tomorrow?
16/1/24, 6:10 PM - +263 78 010 5235: From 10 am to 4pm it will be okay ,and thank you so much
16/1/24, 6:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well, dear. I have taken a note of it. I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 12:00 PM. Until then, take care and have a blessed night! <This message was edited>
16/1/24, 6:45 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Okay thank you so much
17/1/24, 12:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Carlos. How are you all doing today?
17/1/24, 12:52 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Good afternoon
17/1/24, 12:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
17/1/24, 1:26 PM - +263 78 010 5235: I'm ready to proceed
17/1/24, 1:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I discussed your situation with my team, and switching your course is indeed possible. However, MVN University does not offer the course that you are willing to pursue i.e., Economics. In case you are sure about changing your course, we will send your application to other universities who offer the course. However, there is a chance that you may not be able to secure a scholarship of a quantum as high as you were able to secure in the MVN University. As you admission officer, in order to understand your situation better, may I ask what caused a shift in your decision to pursue Economics?
17/1/24, 1:45 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Okay thank you for that, okay so the thing is I want to be forcased and specialize in economics
17/1/24, 2:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand that, dear. However, in order to understand your situation better, may I ask why is your inclination towards economics particularly and what caused you to change your mind to pursue economics now?
17/1/24, 2:31 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Oky so the thing is I really enjoy economics alot and also I always enjoy doing something that is challenging that catch my attention all the time and economics might be the best for me, alys loved economics but was afraid of failing it that is why had had run away from it but realizing that I can tackle it I think I need to try it out
17/1/24, 2:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
17/1/24, 2:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, Kailler. I understand where you are coming from and it is commendable that you were able to recognize your field of interest this early on. Currently you are enrolled into a BBA program which is a management field centric course. However, I am not sure if you have researched about the course and I would like to highlight that pursuing BA Economics might limit your future career options, as you are very knowledgeable in the subjects Statistics and Business studies as well.
17/1/24, 2:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I would suggest that you opt for pursuing B.Com. instead of BA Economics, which is a commerce centric course and will include Economics as a subject. By pursuing B.Com., you will be able to focus on Economics, which is your area of interest, while also studying other subjects that will equip you with knowledge related to the commerce field. This way, your career options will also stay open and will not be limited to the field of Economics.
17/1/24, 2:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
17/1/24, 2:47 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Oky thank you can you please help me explain more about this course
17/1/24, 2:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In addition to that, B.Com. is offered in MVN University, where you have already secured a scholarship of a high quantum. If you choose to switch your course to B.Com., you will be able to secure your scholarship with MVN University while pursuing your field of interest along with your strong subjects i.e., Economics, Statistics and Business Studies. Should I help you with more details regarding the course B.Com.?
17/1/24, 5:29 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes thank you
17/1/24, 5:31 PM - +263 78 010 5235: But can I get an explanation of wat this program is about
18/1/24, 2:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kailler. How are you all doing today?
18/1/24, 2:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Definitely. Allow me to help you understand the course better.
18/1/24, 2:33 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Good afternoon so I have researched about  it I don't think it's something I really need
18/1/24, 2:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Bachelor of Commerce (B.com)* is a three year long undergraduate course that is evenly distributed into 6 half-yearly semesters. 

A high number of jobs are available for B.com graduates in industries such as Information Technology, Manufacturing, Telecommunications and Banking. The most sought after B.Com. jobs are Financial Manger, Accountant, Lecturer, Chartered Accountant, Human Resource Development etc.
18/1/24, 2:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The 3 year B.com degree program aims to facilitate a deep understanding of how business organizations work. It develops knowledge and skills in core B.com subjects like Economics, Accounting, Finance, Banking & Insurance, Marketing, Human Resources and Taxation.
The entire B.com syllabus is designed in a manner which develops competency in students, allowing them to pursue higher level programs. It also increases practical knowledge and employability.
18/1/24, 2:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand, dear. May I know which aspect of the course you did not like?
18/1/24, 2:36 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Okay thank you
18/1/24, 2:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am only asking so that I can understand your preference in a better manner in order to assist you.
18/1/24, 2:42 PM - +263 78 010 5235: So here in Zimbabwe unemployment rate is very high so I wouldn't want to fly all the way to India and study and come back and fail to find a job , that's why I really want to specialize in something so that it won't be hard looking for a job wen I'm done studying and to continue with my accademics because I don't want to end just on a degree wanna go as far as being a professor in economics
18/1/24, 4:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct, @263780105235. The current employment scenario in Zimbabwe is not ideal for one to make a career, and that is one of the reasons students prefer to pursue their education abroad. However, I am a bit concerned about the way you have evaluated your career prospects and your employment opportunities. Let me highlight my concern to you and your family:
18/1/24, 4:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As we were discussing yesterday, if you wish to change your course to a degree in Economics, that is certainly possible, and we would help you secure a scholarship for the same as well. However, since a degree in Economics falls under the umbrella of a niche course, the scholarship opportunity for it will differ, and you might end up losing out on your scholarship opportunity from MVN University. I am sure as a family that is not something you desire.
18/1/24, 4:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Currently, your application has been evaluated under the Endowment Program for the course BBA, and hence you have been able to secure a higher quantum of scholarship, reducing your per annum cost of education to $1250. Now, if we apply to universities for the degree BA Economics, your cost of education would be in the range of $2000 to $3000, and you might not get such a high quantum of scholarship.
18/1/24, 4:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Considering the career prospects and how it would affect your cost of education, may I ask, Kailler, if the unemployment scenario in Zimbabwe is the only reason you wish to pursue a degree in Economics over a degree in Commerce or if there is anything else on your mind? I want to understand this because students all over the world choose a degree in Commerce over a degree in Economics, considering the career prospects and you, however, have opted for a different approach.
18/1/24, 5:07 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes it is one of the reasons
18/1/24, 5:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. Since you mention that it is one of the reasons, could you kindly share any other reasons due to which you wish to pursue economics? I will need to have a better understanding of your approach in order to help you plan your education and career in a better manner that aligns both, your goals and potential. <This message was edited>
18/1/24, 5:22 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Okay other reasons is that I need a special lased degree that will be easy to find a job and at the same time being well rewarding but also being something that will be useful as the world is changing every second due to technology , and also need something I wish enjoy and also need something that is not just broad but specific
20/1/24, 9:47 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kailler. I hope you all are doing well. I apologize for the delay in my response as I had to attend to some urgent work-related situation. However, be rest assured that I am here to help you navigate through this crucial decision making process for your higher education journey.
20/1/24, 11:05 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Good morning okay thank you
20/1/24, 11:31 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I was having a conversation with my team yesterday regarding your application profile and your choice to pursue BA Economics instead of BBA or B.Com. According to my understanding, your concern is related to your wish to pursue a degree while specialising in Economics and also the lack of job opportunities in Zimbabwe due to the economical state of the country. Am I correct Kailler?
20/1/24, 12:06 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes that is true
20/1/24, 12:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand your concern, Kailler. From what you have mentioned, it seems you're worried about job opportunities after completing a degree. If your ultimate aim is to pursue higher education in India and then return to your country, I want to express a concern I have. India is one of the fastest growing economies of the world currently, where job opportunities in every field of education and sector of employment are booming. However, if your plan is to graduate and go back to Zimbabwe, I'm concerned that considering the economic situation there, you might struggle to find a job that is well-suited and well-paid for someone like you, who will hold an international degree. On the other hand, if your goal is to pursue higher education and return to contribute to your country's economy and development, it would be beneficial to pursue a degree that comprehensively covers all the subjects and concepts you aim to gain. I hope we are together in this?
20/1/24, 1:29 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes I understand but I'm not planning to work in my mother country
20/1/24, 1:38 PM - +263 78 010 5235: I need someone that I can specialize in and something that will be available in the business market as things are changing globally
20/1/24, 1:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand, dear. You come from a commerce background and you also happen to have a deep interest in economics. I believe that you know the importance of having business and financial knowledge when delving deeper into the field of economics.

Drawing from my own experience, having graduated in Economics and Finance, I can tell you that studying finance subjects alongside economics provided me with a more comprehensive and practical perspective on the subject. Initially, I wanted to pursue economics exclusively, but my elder sister guided me to opt for a course that covers a broader perspective of the economy, allowing for a better understanding.
20/1/24, 1:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: From my experience, I would like to emphasize that Economics is predominantly a theoretical course, with many concepts based on how an "ideal" world operates. Learning theories and formulas may not be beneficial if one is not aware of how they can be implemented in the real practical world. Studying finance and business subjects alongside economics has enabled me to gain more clarity about global economies and explore diverse career options for the future.
20/1/24, 1:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If your aspiration is to become an economist or an economics professor and contribute to the development and economy of this world, the recommended approach would be to pursue a degree that offers a comprehensive understanding of the economy while emphasizing practical applications. Having said that, you might be wondering what would be the right course to pursue considering all of these factors, right? <This message was edited>
20/1/24, 2:16 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes what can it be
20/1/24, 2:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are asking the right questions, Kailler. I believe, for your particular case, pursuing a *B.Com. degree with a specialization in Economics* would be immensely helpful for several reasons. Yes, that is correct, you can specialize in Economics while pursuing a B.Com. degree. One of the key benefits is that you will gain practical knowledge about Economics while also learning how to apply it in the real world through finance and business subjects. This approach will solidify your concepts and enhance your understanding of global economies. Moreover, pursuing a B.Com. degree provides you with the flexibility to consider a master's degree in Economics in the future. Combining a Bachelor of Commerce (BCom) degree with a Master's in Economics offers a unique blend of business acumen and advanced economic expertise. <This message was edited>
20/1/24, 2:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This interdisciplinary approach equips graduates with a practical understanding of real-world business scenarios, improved quantitative skills, and a global perspective on economic issues. Such a combination makes individuals versatile across various industries, well-suited for roles involving policy analysis, and opens up opportunities for research and networking in both business and economic domains.
20/1/24, 2:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand where you are coming from and I can also understand your thought process, Kailler. As your admission officer, the reason I am discussing this with you in so much detail is because your application is particularly special for me, as I was once exactly in your position. I had my sister to guide me in the right direction, and as your admission officer, I wish to provide you with the same so that you are able to make the right choice for your future. I hope we are together in this?
20/1/24, 3:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know if we are still connected @263780105235? <This message was edited>
20/1/24, 4:25 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Sorry I'm at church
20/1/24, 4:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is quite alright, dear. As your admission officer, and also as someone who has been in your position, I have suggested the best course of path you can take. Remember, Edoofa is here to support you no matter which path you choose for yourself. I would urge you to go through my messages once you get the time to do so and discuss it with your family members. Kindly reach out to me whenever you have gone through the messages.
21/1/24, 2:11 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Good afternoon
21/1/24, 2:11 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Okay so I understand everything that you have said
22/1/24, 8:11 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kailler. I hope everything is well at your end. How are you all doing today?
22/1/24, 8:14 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Good morning everything is perfect thank you
22/1/24, 8:24 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that Kailler. May I know if you had an opportunity to discuss your course selection and its future career prospects with your family?
22/1/24, 8:27 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes I did and they said, I should go for something I enjoy but profitable that will meet all the secrifices to be made not just take a degree for the purpose of being in a university, so that's what they said henceforth said it's either I don't digital marketing or find a economic degree that is very rewarding
22/1/24, 8:34 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand. Like I previously mentioned, if you wish to pursue an Economics degree, we will definitely help you with the same. However, economics is a niche course and the probability of getting a high scholarship quantum like the one you got in MVN University is low. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have considered all the factors and have made a final decision regarding changing your course?
22/1/24, 8:35 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes I need to change it for a better one
22/1/24, 8:37 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Just need a better one which has specialisation, that I can work anywhere after completing my degree with higher rewards
22/1/24, 8:43 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well Kailler. In that case, what is the final decision that you have made?
22/1/24, 8:49 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Need to change the course, get the better one you would recommend which is not bcom because my uncle who is making other remaining payments refused it he said get another one, so I just need the best commercial degree with higher rewards
22/1/24, 8:53 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I ask if you have decided on anything particular or do you need me to help you out with the same?
22/1/24, 9:13 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Along with that, may I inquire if your uncle is added to the group Kailler?
22/1/24, 9:22 AM - +263 78 010 5235: I think you can help me out
22/1/24, 9:22 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Okay it's fine
22/1/24, 9:24 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Apostle Elredai Elredai.vcf (file attached)
22/1/24, 9:24 AM - +263 78 010 5235: This is him
22/1/24, 9:34 AM - Sidhi Edoofa added +263 77 497 2961
22/1/24, 9:40 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing his contact, Kailler. Good Morning @263774972961 , I would like to welcome you to Kailler's admission group. My name is Ms. Siddhi Singh, and I have been counselling Kailler in his admission journey. With our collective efforts and because of Kailler's application profile, he was able to secure a very high quantum of scholarship in the MVN university, i.e., 90% scholarship on tuition fees and 100% scholarship on accommodation fees. However, he has been a bit confused regarding the course he wants to pursue, and that is why we have been unable to process his application further. He mentioned that you are his guardian and sponsor for his higher education. Hence, I wanted to reach out to you in order to understand your final thoughts regarding the course Kailler will pursue in future.
22/1/24, 9:48 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Could you kindly confirm whether you wish to pursue Economics or you wish to pursue another course?
22/1/24, 9:51 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Any course that is good, that I will confirm to be good and like
22/1/24, 9:56 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. However, according to your subject combination and your application profile, I have already suggested that you can pursue B.Com., which will also give you the opportunity to specialize in Economics. Since your goal is to specialize in one area in order to increase your chances of getting a job, I would like to highlight that you can do the same while pursuing B.Com. This will not only ensure that you have an overall grasp of all the subjects that are important to understand the global economy, but also that you will be able to specialize in Economics. In case you wish to pursue only Economics, we can help you do the same. If you wish to pursue a different course altogether, kindly let me know so I can help you with the same.
22/1/24, 9:57 AM - +263 78 010 5235: I can specialize in other courses as long as they are strong and highly qualified
22/1/24, 10:01 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: So may I know if you have made a decision that you do not wish to pursue BBA, B.Com. or Economics?
22/1/24, 10:02 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Not BBA, not B.Com , but with economics if there is such a strong degree it's okay
22/1/24, 10:02 AM - +263 78 010 5235: But kusina I drop it as well
22/1/24, 10:25 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please. According to your application profile, your subject combination and your field of interest, I have already suggested that it is best for you if you pursue a B.Com. degree with a specialization in Economics. A specialization does not always mean pursuing a degree that is focused on one subject. Specialization in Economics while pursuing a B.Com. degree means that a student chooses to focus their elective courses or major specifically on economics-related subjects. This specialization allows students to delve deeper into economic theories, principles, and applications, gaining a more in-depth understanding of economic concepts within the context of commerce.
22/1/24, 10:26 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I need you to understand that specialization is not limited to pursuing one subject in your higher education. In the past 15+ years, Edoofa has been working in the education sector and has gained experience in field. Using that knowledge, we have carefully included universities and the courses that are being offered by us.
22/1/24, 10:27 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Oky thank you so much, what would I do with this degree and work
22/1/24, 10:27 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our suggestion according to your scholarship profile would be B.Com. with a specialization in Economics. However if you wish to pursue something else altogether, I will require you to mention the same so that I can help you with it.
22/1/24, 10:27 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: You have also managed to gain a high scholarship quantum in the MVN University, whose deadline date is approaching i.e., 26 January 2024. In case you wish to change the course, I believe we have to make a final call swiftly, because it will put you in a difficult position where you will lose your current offer letter. <This message was edited>
22/1/24, 10:29 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes I need a different course,
22/1/24, 10:30 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Even digital marketing will be better
22/1/24, 10:31 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Like I had previously mentioned during our conversation, a B.Com. with a specialization in economics opens doors to diverse career paths, including roles such as financial analyst, economic consultant, investment analyst, market research analyst, policy analyst, financial planner, business development analyst, data analyst, credit analyst, and entrepreneurial ventures.
22/1/24, 10:32 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Okay okay
22/1/24, 10:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know your thought process behind pursuing digital marketing? Since you have been mentioning that you have an interest in the commerce field and showed a deep interest in pursuing economics and becoming an economics professor, I am a bit confused as to why you have decided to pursue digital marketing that is not closely related to the field of economics?
22/1/24, 10:34 AM - +263 78 010 5235: It's just another option I had on stand by Incase I can't have the degree of interest
22/1/24, 10:38 AM - +263 78 010 5235: This is good
22/1/24, 10:43 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please. May I ask you to consider the job opportunities along with your further educational opportunities that comes with specializing in Economics while pursuing B.Com.? In case you do not find it fit, kindly let me know.
22/1/24, 10:44 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes I do consider the job opportunities
22/1/24, 10:45 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please. Kindly take some time to discuss the same with your family members. Until then, I will wait for your response.
22/1/24, 10:45 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Okay thank you
22/1/24, 10:49 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I must emphasize that these job opportunities are one of the most rewarding job profiles and they require a high intellectual level as well.
22/1/24, 10:52 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Okay will take not of that
22/1/24, 11:24 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Oky so for now I want you to help me with these ones bachelor in economics, digital marketing, financial economics and trade, environment economics,
22/1/24, 11:24 AM - +263 78 010 5235: I need any among these will do
22/1/24, 11:51 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
22/1/24, 11:52 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please I understand. In such a case, I would like to mention that digital marketing, financial economics and trade, environment economics - all of these are offered as elective subjects during your graduation. If you wish to keep your career options in digital marketing open along with pursuing economics, all of the above can be pursued if you choose B.Com. with an economics specialization. However, if you wish to pursue economics only, once you enter that field it will get difficult for you to pursue a career in digital marketing or a related marketing field. While pursuing B.Com., you will get to study subjects that will strengthen your financial and business skills along with a stronger grasp of Economics, and it will help you to keep your career options open to fields other than economics, like finance, business, marketing and entrepreneurship.
22/1/24, 11:52 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I encourage you to make a decision based on this information and let me know if you prefer to pursue a bachelor's in economics or a degree that combines a focus on economics with the flexibility to explore various fields.
22/1/24, 11:59 AM - +263 78 010 5235: I want bachelor in economics
22/1/24, 12:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please I understand. I would like to inform you that the cost of education will be higher if you choose to pursue Economics, however since you are okay with it, the next steps will be as follows -
22/1/24, 12:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Please write a mail to academicboard@edoofa.com stating that you wish to change your course from BBA to BA in Economics and state the reason why.

Please also mention your admission group name in the mail, once done share the screenshot with me.
22/1/24, 12:05 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Okay thank you
22/1/24, 12:55 PM - +263 78 010 5235: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 12:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well, dear. The academic board will evaluate your profile and revert with a confirmation email once the switch has been approved. I hope you are following?
22/1/24, 1:11 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes I am
25/1/24, 12:28 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Good afternoon
25/1/24, 12:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Kailler. How are you doing today?
25/1/24, 1:11 PM - +263 78 010 5235: I'm doing well thank you , any updates
25/1/24, 1:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. After updating your application profile, we have sent out your application to the universities and are currently waiting for an update from their end. Once we receive an update, I will reach out to you. In the meanwhile, I believe you must have received a confirmation of course change approval from the Academic Board?
25/1/24, 1:27 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Nop not yet haven't received anything
25/1/24, 1:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 1:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As per our records, this email has been sent to you. Could you kindly check your inbox once again and confirm whether you have received the email?
25/1/24, 2:22 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Okay thank you
29/1/24, 1:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Parents and Kailler,

30/1/24, 3:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
30/1/24, 3:54 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Oky thank you
30/1/24, 4:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
30/1/24, 4:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
30/1/24, 4:28 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Thank you
30/1/24, 4:34 PM - +263 78 010 5235: 1.  $900

2.    3 yrs

3.    $300

4.  $750
30/1/24, 5:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
30/1/24, 5:28 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes  it does
30/1/24, 6:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I would love to continue with our discussion, however, my operational hours for the day have concluded. Let us reconnect tomorrow at 2:00 PM to further discuss your offer letter from Galgotias University. I wish you a blessed day ahead!
30/1/24, 6:04 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Okay
31/1/24, 2:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kailler. I hope you are having a wonderful day. How are you all doing today?
31/1/24, 2:33 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Good afternoon
31/1/24, 2:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased that we were able to make progress in our previous interaction. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
31/1/24, 2:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
31/1/24, 2:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
31/1/24, 2:57 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Oky well noted
31/1/24, 3:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
31/1/24, 3:28 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes thank you
31/1/24, 4:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
31/1/24, 4:32 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes I am
31/1/24, 5:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
31/1/24, 5:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on 12 February 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
31/1/24, 5:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
31/1/24, 5:29 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Okay thank you
31/1/24, 5:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $650  of the registration fee. This $650 can be conveniently paid in two instalments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$325 before the first deadline date of 12 February, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$325  before the second deadline date of 12 March, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
31/1/24, 5:31 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Oky thank you
31/1/24, 5:36 PM - +263 78 010 5235: So I would want to ask, from the discuss we had , I have a total cost of $1800 towards my tuition fee, and this has nothing to do with my accomodations, meaning if I'm off campus I need $1200 so meaning yearly we be required to pay $3000 , is that so
1/2/24, 10:14 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kailler. I hope you are all doing wonderful today. Kindly excuse me for not being able to respond to your message last night, as our operational hours had already concluded.
1/2/24, 10:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As mentioned in my message earlier, if you take the university's guidance and opt for off-campus accommodation, that will cost you $1200. However, if you go for the independent off-campus accommodation, you will be able to cover your accommodation expenses within $800, including food and basic living expenses. That rounds your total yearly expense to be $1800 (tuition fees) + $800 (independent off-campus accommodation fee) + $200 (examination fee) = $2800

May I know if you are following?
1/2/24, 10:46 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Oky oky
1/2/24, 11:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $650 within 15 working days, before *12 February, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
1/2/24, 11:19 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes thank you
1/2/24, 11:44 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
1/2/24, 11:44 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
1/2/24, 11:45 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes I'm in Harare
1/2/24, 12:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
1/2/24, 12:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
1/2/24, 12:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
1/2/24, 1:29 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Okay thank you
1/2/24, 1:55 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Oky would like to ask the $900 fee I will be paying per semester will it be possible to pay it in installments  and if so what will be the acceptable amount per installment
1/2/24, 2:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please. You will be paying $750 as registration fee by 12 February, which will be inclusive of your 1st semester fees. This means that you will have to pay the remaining balance of $150 within the first 3 days upon your arrival in India. Along with that fee, you will be paying $100 as examination fee. Hence, the total amount you will have to pay upon your arrival in India is $250.
1/2/24, 2:40 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Oky thank you, that is well noted, so for other semesters. .can I also pay $900 in installments
1/2/24, 2:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To answer your query about paying in instalments, it is definitely possible. You have an option to pay your next semester fees ($900) in monthly instalments, but this is conditional on you starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. You can deposit an amount of $150 per month to ensure that your fees for the next semester are already paid before your deadline in January. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
1/2/24, 2:43 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Okay thank you we'll noted, so this means it is possible paying my fees in Installments, what about my accomodations fees can I also pay it in  installments
1/2/24, 5:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, you will have the option to pay for your off-campus accommodation on a monthly basis.
1/2/24, 5:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
1/2/24, 5:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send.
1/2/24, 5:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly find the account details once again for your reference:

If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference - 

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738 <This message was edited>
1/2/24, 5:13 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Oky thank you
1/2/24, 5:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right Kailler, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
1/2/24, 5:14 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Oky well noted
2/2/24, 10:30 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kailler.

I hope you are having a wonderful morning. In our previous conversation, we had discussed the following aspects of the offer letter:

1. Tuition fee
2. Accommodation
3. Exam fee
4. Deadline
5. Endowment benefit
6. Payment modes
7. Fee summary
2/2/24, 10:30 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
2/2/24, 10:30 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
2/2/24, 10:30 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
2/2/24, 10:30 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
2/2/24, 11:01 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Okay well noted thank you
2/2/24, 1:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
2/2/24, 1:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
2/2/24, 1:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
2/2/24, 2:28 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Okay thank you
2/2/24, 3:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
2/2/24, 3:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to inquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
2/2/24, 8:08 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Nop everything is clear
2/2/24, 8:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I will reconnect with you tomorrow to share some university insights. On this note, let us conclude our conversation. I wish you a blessed night!
2/2/24, 8:32 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Thank you
