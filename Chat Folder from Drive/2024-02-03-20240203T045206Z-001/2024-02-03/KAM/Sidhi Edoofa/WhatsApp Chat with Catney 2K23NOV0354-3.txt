After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know by when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.

9/1/24, 9:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.

If I talk about myself, I have made a resolution to bring more humility in myself and bring about a change in my perspective to be a better version of myself all while ensuring that I help all of our students to achieve their educational goals. With that said, I would like to know what aspirations or a change in your approach towards life you wish to achieve?

However, since you are going to be occupied with school and your parents are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
12/1/24, 3:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January]. This way, we can align it with our availability as well and help you move forward and make progress in a streamlined manner. Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your input and find the right time for our sessions.

31/1/24, 3:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of February, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
31/1/24, 3:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
31/1/24, 3:29 PM - +263 78 236 0162: End of February
31/1/24, 3:37 PM - +263 78 236 0276: End of Feb then assist with the acc we will be depositing
31/1/24, 4:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In such a case, would it be feasible for you if we select the monthly deposit date as the 30th of every month (month-end), with an exception for the month of February i.e., 29th February?

1/2/24, 2:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I couldn't quite understand what you are trying to say. Could you kindly elaborate it for me?
1/2/24, 2:37 PM - +263 78 236 0276: Like for example am to deposit $150,then l deposit $200/$250
1/2/24, 4:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for elaborating. I understand please. You always have the option of paying in advance. For example, if you happen to have the budget to pay $200 in the month of March, the amount will be adjusted and you will be required to pay $100 in the month of April. Afterwards, you can also choose to continue with the designated payment plan, and complete the installments early. I hope this was helpful?
