28/12/23, 7:55 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
28/12/23, 8:01 PM - +263 78 324 9174: Yes, can we start depositing Feb, as for now we are busy covering fees for him to go back to school. But If I manage Jan I will let you know

28/12/23, 8:20 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly we can proceed with that.
28/12/23, 8:20 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know by when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
28/12/23, 8:40 PM - +263 78 757 2788: I can talk to them first
28/12/23, 9:12 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As much as I wanted to proceed with the session my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow properly again.

Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
9/1/24, 9:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test. This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
9/1/24, 9:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
9/1/24, 9:38 PM - +263 78 324 9174: Hallo Mr Dev Kumar, l am Samuel's mother. We are doing fine. Samuel has gone to school, he's at boarding school
12/1/24, 9:48 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are doing fine. Thank you for informing @263783249174. I have taken note of it and completely understand.

12/1/24, 1:21 PM - +263 78 324 9174: It's ok, we may proceed
12/1/24, 8:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! Now, moving towards the admission process, We, at Edoofa, are determined to provide affordable higher education to hardworking students and assist them in launching their careers to greater heights. We will be able to help you only if we can connect timely and have healthy discussions.
12/1/24, 8:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, this is something I want to inform you all that the agenda for the discussions, that we are going to have, is to help you all understand the process you will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since you are going to be occupied with school and your parents are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
12/1/24, 8:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January]. This way, we can align it with our availability as well and help you move forward and make progress in a streamlined manner. Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your input and find the right time for our sessions.

Since you have been one of the most dedicated students, and I see you have great aspirations, I wanted you to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.
30/1/24, 2:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of January, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
30/1/24, 2:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
30/1/24, 3:46 PM - +263 78 324 9174: I am sorry to say this, here we don't have fixed salaries, we are ordinary people who hustle to make ends meet, l can not give the actual date, l will have to pay when I have it, within the period,
30/1/24, 3:48 PM - +263 78 324 9174: I am sorry Ms, I sound rude, but the kind of life we've here,
30/1/24, 3:50 PM - +263 78 324 9174: I will pay February,
30/1/24, 4:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In such a case, you may choose the date as the end of every month i.e., 30th. You have the flexibility of making the monthly deposit anytime between the previous and the upcoming deadline date. The monthly deposit date is to ensure that by that particular date, you have made the deposit of $150. May I know if this was helpful?
30/1/24, 4:47 PM - +263 78 324 9174: Okay, thank you for help, we say 29 February
30/1/24, 5:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In such a case, it would mean that for the next 10 months, you will be required to pay on the 30th of the said month, with February as an exception, during which you will make the payment on the 29th. I hope you are following?
30/1/24, 5:48 PM - +263 78 324 9174: Yes l am,
30/1/24, 5:48 PM - +263 78 324 9174: Thank you
