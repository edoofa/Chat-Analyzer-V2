21/12/23, 3:05 PM - +263 78 838 3513: 2.Please elaborate on the difference between Rights and Duties and give a further
explanation of the difference in Human Rights and Civil Rights.


The difference between rights and duties is that rights are freedoms or entitlements that a person has, while duties are obligations or responsibilities that a person has. Rights are often legally protected, while duties may not be. Human rights are the basic rights and freedoms that all humans are entitled to, regardless of their nationality, race, gender, or other factors. Civil rights are the specific rights and freedoms that are guaranteed by the laws of a country, such as the right to vote, the right to due process, and the right to equal protection under the law. 

Furthermore,Rights are the freedoms that a person has, while duties are the obligations that a person has. Rights are about what a person can do, while duties are about what a person must do. Rights are often seen as "positive" entitlements, while duties are seen as "negative" obligations.
Rights are often seen as legally enforceable, while duties may be seen as more moral or ethical obligations. For example, the right to free speech is a legal right that is protected by law.


To elaborate further, human rights are based on the idea that all people are entitled to certain basic freedoms, such as the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. These rights are often enshrined in national constitutions and international treaties, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Civil rights, on the other hand, are those that are specific to a particular country or region, and may not be as widely recognized. For example, the right to vote is a civil right in many countries, but it is not a human right that is recognized by all nations.

However, Rights are freedoms that a person has, while duties are obligations that a person has. The two are often intertwined, with rights giving people the freedom to do what they want, and duties giving people the responsibility to use that freedom in a way that benefits everyone. The concept of rights and duties can vary depending on the context, but they are always about balancing the needs and interests of individuals and the wider society. 

To put it simply, rights and duties are two sides of the same coin. Without rights, people would not have the freedom to pursue their own interests. Without duties, there would be no social order or protection for the weak and vulnerable. They go hand in hand, and both are necessary for a just and functioning society. It's important to remember that the exact nature of rights and duties may vary depending on the society and context, but the underlying principle remains the same. 

To conclude,There are many difference between rights and duties. One cannot turn a blind eye on some similarities of rights and duties.
21/12/23, 3:10 PM - +263 78 838 3513: 4.Which branch of law are you most interested in pursuing, Civil, Corporate or Criminal,
and why?


Reasons to prefer criminal law is that it can be seen as a more "pure" form of law, since it's focused on protecting the public interest. Criminal law also has a clear and well-defined structure, with clear rules and procedures. Criminal law also offers the chance to see justice served and wrongs made right. Finally, it's a challenging and engaging area of law, with plenty of opportunities for growth and development.

Criminal law has a clear and well-defined structure. There are established rules and procedures that must be followed in every case. For example, there are strict rules about what evidence can be used, and how it must be presented. There are also clear guidelines for how the prosecution and defense must behave, and what they are allowed to do. This structure ensures that everyone is treated fairly and has the same rights and protections. It also makes the process more transparent and understandable for everyone involved. 

Seeing justice served is one of the most satisfying parts of working in criminal law. When someone has broken the law and caused harm, it can be very gratifying to see them held accountable and punished for their actions. This is especially true when the victim is able to see justice served, and they can feel some sense of closure 
and healing. Even if the criminal justice system isn't perfect, it can still be very meaningful to see it working to make things right.

Moreso,When we talk about "wrong made right" in criminal law, we're referring to the idea of "restorative justice". This is a concept that focuses on repairing the harm that has been done, rather than just punishing the offender. For example, a victim of a crime may be able to receive compensation for their losses, or the offender may be required to do community service or other forms of restitution. In this way, the wrong can be made right in a way that goes beyond simply locking someone .

Criminal law is designed to treat everyone fairly and equally, regardless of their background or status. This is known as the principle of "equality before the law". Under this principle, everyone is entitled to the same rights and protections, and they should be treated in the same way by the criminal justice system. This means that rich and poor, famous and unknown, powerful and powerless, should all be treated equally. For example, everyone has the right to a fair trial, the right to an attorney, and the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.

In conclusion, criminal law is an important part of the legal system, and it has many benefits. It provides a way to hold people accountable for breaking the law, it can make victims feel better by seeing justice served, and it treats everyone fairly and equally. Criminal law is an ever-evolving field, and it will continue to play a crucial role in society.
21/12/23, 4:04 PM - +263 78 838 3513: 3.What is the difference between a prosecutor and an attorney
There are several differences between a prosecutor and an attorney. A prosecutor is a lawyer who works for the government, and their job is to bring criminal charges against people accused of crimes. An attorney, on the other hand, is a lawyer who can represent people in any legal matter, including both criminal and civil cases. In addition, prosecutors only represent the state, while attorneys can represent individuals, businesses, or organizations. Prosecutors also have the power to decide whether to bring charges against someone, while attorneys do not have that power. 

In addition, There are several other differences between prosecutors and attorneys. Prosecutors are often salaried government employees, while attorneys can be private practitioners or work for firms. Prosecutors typically have a lot of experience with the criminal justice system, while attorneys may specialize in other areas of the law. Finally, prosecutors are usually bound by ethical rules and laws that prevent them from disclosing certain information about their cases, while attorneys are not always subject to the same restrictions.

Furthermore, some of different roles of prosecutors and attorneys, we can explore that as well. As mentioned before, prosecutors work for the government and bring criminal charges against people. They also work with law enforcement to investigate crimes, and they make decisions about whether to offer a plea deal or go to trial. Attorneys, on the other hand, can represent either the prosecution or the defense in a case. They interview witnesses, prepare evidence, and make arguments on behalf of their clients. In this way, prosecutors and attorneys have complementary but different roles in the criminal justice system. 

Moreso, There are different types of attorneys. First, there are civil attorneys, who handle disputes between individuals or businesses. Then, there are criminal defense attorneys, who represent people who have been accused of a crime. There are also family law attorneys, who specialize in matters like divorce, child custody, and adoption. And there are also personal injury attorneys, who handle cases involving injuries that people have suffered. There are many more types of attorneys, but these are some of the most common.

Appart from the above , there are also some similarities between prosecutors and attorneys. For example, both types of lawyers are required to have a law degree, and both must pass a bar exam. Both types of lawyers must also adhere to ethical standards of conduct, such as confidentiality and honesty. Additionally, both prosecutors and attorneys must have strong research, writing, and communication skills. And finally, both types of lawyers must be prepared to argue their cases in court if necessary. 

In conclusion, both prosecutors and attorneys play crucial roles in our legal system. Prosecutors enforce the law and hold people accountable for breaking it, while attorneys represent and advocate for their clients. While there are some similarities between the two professions, there are also many important differences. These differences reflect the different roles that prosecutors and attorneys play in our society. It's important to understand these differences in order to appreciate the complexity of our legal system.

Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
9/1/24, 9:25 PM - Dev Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test. This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.

If I talk about myself, I have made a resolution to bring more humility in myself and bring about a change in my perspective to be a better version of myself all while ensuring that I help all of our students to achieve their educational goals. With that said, I would like to know what aspirations or a change in your approach towards life you wish to achieve?
12/1/24, 6:45 PM - +263 78 838 3513: My aspirations and changes in approach towards life that i wish to achieve are ,desire to make a positive difference in the world through my work as a lawyer. Another aspect is my willingness to challenge myself  and learn new things as i pursue a career in law. Additionally, my change in approach towards life could involve developing strong critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are essential for a career in law.
12/1/24, 8:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that you want to become a better version of yourself by equipping new skills related to your field.

26/1/24, 3:53 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa added Sidhi Edoofa
26/1/24, 9:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Senior,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa*. Recently I was having a discussion with the Academic Board. They highlighted  that you have not been able to proceed with your admission process in a timely manner, since your child is at school and you have been occupied with work. Hence, I pitched in that I will be able to help you out and take over your application profile so that together we can ensure a timely and smooth progress. Since my operational hours accommodate your timings more suitably, I will be assuming the duties of your admission officer. I am optimistic that together, we can pave the way for an auspicious beginning to your academic journey, resulting in the right career prospects and eventual success for both you and your family.
26/1/24, 9:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 9:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Today, on India's 75th Republic Day, I want to extend warm regards to you and your family!

26/1/24, 9:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: On this auspicious note, I would like to extend my heartiest regards to you and your family, and I hope that just like my proud nation, we will work unitedly and make progress in your admission process to ensure that you are able to realise your dream of pursuing higher education here in India. I would like to schedule our session for 8:30 AM tomorrow, so that we can discuss the progress and the next steps to be taken for your admission journey.
26/1/24, 10:29 PM - +263 78 838 3513: Duly noted with thanks sir
27/1/24, 9:06 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Senior. I hope you are having a lovely morning. How are you all doing today?
27/1/24, 10:54 AM - +263 78 838 3513: We're good and you sir?
27/1/24, 11:13 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are all doing good. I am doing fine myself, thank you for asking. Since this is the first time we are interacting, allow me to introduce myself. I am Miss Siddhi Singh, your Admission Officer. I belong from the vibrant city of Varanasi, known as one of the oldest living cities globally, Beyond my passion for education, I find joy in music and playing basketball. It is my pleasure to assist and guide you through the admission process, ensuring you achieve your dream education in India with the support of Edoofa.
27/1/24, 11:18 AM - +263 78 838 3513: Okay nice to meet you sir. I'm glad you find joy in music same as myself
27/1/24, 11:49 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to know that we have similarities, Senior. I was going through your application profile, and it is my understanding that you were able to successfully complete the 2nd step of the admission cycle i.e., Statement of Purpose. May I know if I am correct?
27/1/24, 11:59 AM - +263 78 838 3513: Yes sir you're correct
27/1/24, 12:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. You are conversing with Miss Siddhi, dear. I believe you mistakenly addressed me as sir.
27/1/24, 12:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand that you have school during the weekdays and your parents are occupied with work. In such a case, I want to ensure that our sessions are held in a timely and smooth manner so we can comfortably proceed with your application process. Could you kindly suggest a 1-hour slot between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM when we can have our sessions?
27/1/24, 2:34 PM - +263 78 838 3513: Ooh! Very sorry it's a typing error
27/1/24, 2:36 PM - +263 78 838 3513: 16:00-17:00 it will be easier to connect
27/1/24, 3:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. In such a case, we will be concluding today's conversation and reconnect on Monday at 4:00 PM to further discuss your application process. Until then, please take care and kindly extend my regards to your family as well!
27/1/24, 5:37 PM - +263 78 838 3513: Duly noted with thanks
29/1/24, 4:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Senior. I hope you are all doing well today. How has your day been going so far?
30/1/24, 2:31 PM - +263 78 838 3513: Good afternoon everyone
30/1/24, 2:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Senior. I hope everything is well on your end. How are you all doing today?
30/1/24, 2:52 PM - +263 78 838 3513: We're doing well and your side? <This message was edited>
30/1/24, 3:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am fine too, thank you for asking. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
30/1/24, 3:31 PM - +263 78 838 3513: Yes! It's correct
30/1/24, 3:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
30/1/24, 3:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
30/1/24, 3:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
30/1/24, 4:05 PM - +263 78 838 3513: Sure Ms. Siddhi
30/1/24, 4:06 PM - +263 78 838 3513: Yes , I'm wondering about the details of that Financial Secure Plan
30/1/24, 4:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
30/1/24, 4:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
30/1/24, 4:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
30/1/24, 4:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
30/1/24, 4:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
30/1/24, 4:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
30/1/24, 4:17 PM - +263 78 838 3513: That's a good plan, we also wish to have
30/1/24, 5:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
30/1/24, 5:08 PM - +263 78 838 3513: Yah sure
30/1/24, 6:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion, however, my operational hours for the day have concluded. Let us reconnect tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the admission process. I wish you a blessed day ahead!
30/1/24, 6:47 PM - +263 78 838 3513: I would like to thank you for your precious time, i really appreciate
31/1/24, 4:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Senior. I hope you are having a wonderful day. How are you all doing today?
31/1/24, 4:31 PM - +263 78 838 3513: How are you Ms. Siddhi
31/1/24, 5:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am fine, thank you for asking Senior. In our previous conversation, we were discussing about the Financial Secure Plan. Moving forward in today's discussion, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
31/1/24, 5:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
31/1/24, 5:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
31/1/24, 5:33 PM - +263 78 838 3513: Meaning the first year need about $3000
31/1/24, 6:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: No, Senior. We are helping you prepare for the first 1 and a half years of your higher education within the first 10 months of the plan i.e., saving $1500. After that, for the next 10 months, you will be saving for the rest of your higher education journey, summing up to $3000. May I know if you were able to follow through?
1/2/24, 11:00 AM - +263 78 838 3513: Okay, i think I understand
1/2/24, 11:38 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Senior. I hope you are all doing great today!

I would like to make a correction in my last message. The Financial Secure Plan is helping you plan your finances for the next 20 months and aims to save up to $3000 within this span of time. This will help you cover the cost of your initial 1 and a half years of higher education. May I know if this was clear, Senior?
1/2/24, 12:15 PM - +263 78 838 3513: Okay Ms. Siddhi I understand
1/2/24, 2:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
1/2/24, 2:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
1/2/24, 2:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
1/2/24, 6:06 PM - +263 78 838 3513: Duly noted
1/2/24, 6:06 PM - +263 78 838 3513: Yes I'm able to see this perspective
1/2/24, 6:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
1/2/24, 6:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
1/2/24, 6:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
1/2/24, 6:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
2/2/24, 7:39 AM - +263 78 838 3513: Yes, they will be a percentage need to be paid to keep money safe
2/2/24, 10:47 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Senior.

I hope you are having a wonderful morning. I am pleased to see that you agree with the perspective I am sharing with you. Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
2/2/24, 10:47 AM - +263 78 838 3513: How Ms. Siddhi
2/2/24, 12:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you paid in the month of January.
2/2/24, 12:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
2/2/24, 12:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
2/2/24, 7:28 PM - +263 78 838 3513: Very correct
2/2/24, 7:32 PM - +263 78 838 3513: Sorry Ms. Siddhi, may you please explain this message i have a slight confusion
2/2/24, 8:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I surely will Senior. Since my operational hours have concluded and I have had a long day already, let us conclude our conversation for today. We will reconnect tomorrow and I will help you out with your query and we will further discuss the Financial Secure Plan as well.

I wish you a blessed night!
