*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
20/12/23, 7:44 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
20/12/23, 7:44 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identifying reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
20/12/23, 7:45 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
20/12/23, 7:45 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?

So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 6:30 PM.
20/12/23, 8:07 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1.

30/1/24, 5:23 PM - +263 78 745 9092: Yes you are correct
30/1/24, 6:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
30/1/24, 6:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
30/1/24, 6:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
30/1/24, 6:15 PM - +263 78 745 9092: Am following  you can carry on please
30/1/24, 6:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion, however, my operational hours for the day have concluded. Let us reconnect tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the admission process. I wish you a blessed day ahead!
30/1/24, 6:32 PM - +263 78 745 9092: Ok thank you .
31/1/24, 4:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Simbarashe. I hope you are having a wonderful day. How are you all doing today?
31/1/24, 4:24 PM - +263 78 745 9092: We are fine . How are you
31/1/24, 4:24 PM - +263 77 416 1928: Good afternoon
31/1/24, 5:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am fine too, thank you for asking. In our previous conversation, we were discussing the Financial Secure Plan. Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
31/1/24, 5:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
31/1/24, 5:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
31/1/24, 5:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
31/1/24, 5:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
31/1/24, 5:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
31/1/24, 5:13 PM - +263 78 745 9092: Yes it is a great advantage to us and we wish to have it.
31/1/24, 5:21 PM - +263 77 416 1928: Yes it is very important to have that financial l can understand it
31/1/24, 6:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, allow me to help you understand how the plan works. As you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
31/1/24, 6:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
31/1/24, 6:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
31/1/24, 7:01 PM - +263 77 416 1928: Yes I agree Mr Austin talked about it during the counseling sessions we had with him
31/1/24, 7:10 PM - +263 77 416 1928: We had good discussions with him about the issue of finance
31/1/24, 7:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you were able to discuss the same with Mr. Austin. 

Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
31/1/24, 7:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
31/1/24, 7:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
31/1/24, 7:34 PM - +263 77 416 1928: It's a very good perspective our goal is to first secure the 3000 for the the 1st year be for our child comes to India so that we always have on other year to organised the finance for the coming that way it will not be overwhelmed then so the financial plan is very important to us as parents
1/2/24, 10:18 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Simbrashe. I hope you are all doing wonderful today!

Kindly excuse me for being unable to respond to your message last night, as our operational hours had already concluded. I am glad to see that you agree with the importance of planning and consistency in order to ensure financial security for Simbarashe's higher education.
1/2/24, 10:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.

If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
1/2/24, 10:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
1/2/24, 10:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
1/2/24, 10:57 AM - +263 77 416 1928: Yes you are right but as for the nostro account l already have it so l can use it for the savings
1/2/24, 11:09 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Since you already have a nostro account, I am sure that you are aware that you have to pay charges every month for it, right?
1/2/24, 11:11 AM - +263 77 416 1928: Yes that is the one l use for my Salary so it's not a big problem
1/2/24, 11:43 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Thank you for letting me know that. This aspect is a challenge for some of our students, and hence we have also considered it while curating the Financial Secure Plan. Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
1/2/24, 11:45 AM - +263 77 416 1928: Yes l would like  to hear more about it
1/2/24, 12:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay before your due date.
1/2/24, 12:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
1/2/24, 12:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
1/2/24, 12:59 PM - +263 77 416 1928: I have paid the 350 for Edoofa Enrolment  l paid 200usd and then in December l had paid the 150usd
1/2/24, 1:02 PM - +263 77 416 1928: I used Ecocash to this person
1/2/24, 1:02 PM - +263 77 416 1928: *Mukuru Details of Mrs Jerera*

2/2/24, 12:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Simbarashe.

I hope you are having a wonderful day. Thank you for sharing the message with me. I have duly taken a note of it.
2/2/24, 12:09 PM - +263 77 416 1928: Thank you
2/2/24, 12:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know if you are currently available to continue with our discussion regarding the Financial Secure Plan?
2/2/24, 12:13 PM - +263 77 416 1928: As a parent l am
2/2/24, 12:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. Before we move ahead, could you kindly confirm on which date you had made this payment? Our accounts team was unable to track your payment, hence providing them with a date will help them in confirming your payment.
2/2/24, 12:19 PM - +263 77 416 1928: I paid on the 23 of December
2/2/24, 1:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that for me. I will soon give you an update regarding the same. In the meanwhile, may I know if you are available to proceed with our discussion about the Financial Secure Plan? <This message was edited>
2/2/24, 1:28 PM - +263 77 416 1928: We can continue
2/2/24, 2:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
2/2/24, 2:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
2/2/24, 2:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
2/2/24, 2:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
2/2/24, 3:03 PM - +263 77 416 1928: The registration fees is it part of the tuition
2/2/24, 3:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct. The registration fees will be adjusted against your first year of university fees. I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
2/2/24, 4:16 PM - +263 77 416 1928: I have question incase something unknown happens which results in my child not be able to come to India then will l get the refund
2/2/24, 4:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. May I know if you have something particular in mind due to which you think Simbarashe will not be able to come to India?
2/2/24, 4:46 PM - +263 77 416 1928: Something like illnesses
2/2/24, 5:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Is Simbarashe undergoing any sort of treatment back home, due to which you are worrying?
2/2/24, 5:39 PM - +263 77 416 1928: No that's why l said the unknown
2/2/24, 6:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Usually, such things do not occur. In a scenario where the student is ill, I am sure that you are aware about how highly advanced India's healthcare is. Surely, if you have access to better healthcare, you would not want to let go of that opportunity.

Having said that, I understand where you are coming from, allow me to help you with your query. In a situation where the student is unable to come to India due to personal reasons the amount is non-refundable as the amount is dedicated towards the student's higher education. I am sure that as a parent you must also think about the long-term plan, and would want to ensure that under no unforeseen circumstances you will be projected to financial constraints because you will already be saving up for Simbarashe's higher education. I hope we are together in this?
2/2/24, 6:48 PM - +263 77 416 1928: OK l understand
2/2/24, 8:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that this was helpful. Since my operational hours have already concluded, let us reconnect tomorrow to further discuss the way forward.

I wish you a blessed night!
