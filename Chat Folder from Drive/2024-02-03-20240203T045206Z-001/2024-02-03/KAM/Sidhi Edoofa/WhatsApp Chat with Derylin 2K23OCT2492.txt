26/1/24, 9:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Derylin,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa*. Recently I was having a discussion with the Academic Board. They highlighted  that you have not been able to proceed with your admission process in a timely manner, since your child is at school and you have been occupied with work. Hence, I pitched in that I will be able to help you out and take over your application profile so that together we can ensure a timely and smooth progress. Since my operational hours accommodate your timings more suitably, I will be assuming the duties of your admission officer. I am optimistic that together, we can pave the way for an auspicious beginning to your academic journey, resulting in the right career prospects and eventual success for both you and your family. <This message was edited>

30/1/24, 12:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Derylin. I hope everything is well on your end. How are you all doing today?
30/1/24, 12:04 PM - +263 78 111 7306: We are fine and you
30/1/24, 12:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Everything is well here, thank you for asking. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
30/1/24, 12:10 PM - +263 78 111 7306: Sorry  to ask but what does BA LLB stands for
30/1/24, 12:10 PM - +263 78 111 7306: And about arriving in lndia during August 2025 it's true
30/1/24, 12:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the confusion. The course you are going to pursue is BCom, am I correct?
30/1/24, 12:53 PM - +263 78 111 7306: Yes BCom
30/1/24, 1:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
30/1/24, 1:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
30/1/24, 1:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
30/1/24, 1:52 PM - +263 78 111 7306: Yes l am wondering 🤔
30/1/24, 2:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
30/1/24, 2:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
30/1/24, 2:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
30/1/24, 2:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
30/1/24, 2:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
30/1/24, 2:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
30/1/24, 2:23 PM - +263 78 111 7306: It is  what we wish for
30/1/24, 2:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
30/1/24, 3:22 PM - +263 78 111 7306: Yes ma'am you may
30/1/24, 3:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
30/1/24, 3:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
30/1/24, 3:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
30/1/24, 3:53 PM - +263 78 111 7306: Yes l  do
30/1/24, 3:53 PM - +263 78 111 7306: Do how does it work
30/1/24, 4:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
30/1/24, 4:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
30/1/24, 4:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
30/1/24, 4:55 PM - +263 78 111 7306: Yes l can see it
30/1/24, 5:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion, however, my operational hours for the day have concluded. Let us reconnect tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the admission process. I wish you a blessed day ahead!
30/1/24, 5:57 PM - +263 78 111 7306: Thank you  and same to you
31/1/24, 11:54 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Derylin. I hope you are having a lovely morning. How are you all doing today?
31/1/24, 12:08 PM - +263 77 352 0743: We arw fine
31/1/24, 12:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you are fine. During our previous interaction, we were discussing the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
31/1/24, 12:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
31/1/24, 12:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
31/1/24, 12:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
31/1/24, 2:22 PM - +263 77 352 0743: True
31/1/24, 2:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
31/1/24, 3:03 PM - +263 77 352 0743: You can go ahead
31/1/24, 3:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay before your due date.
31/1/24, 3:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
31/1/24, 3:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
31/1/24, 3:33 PM - +263 77 352 0743: You mean l have to deposit 150 into your account for 10 months
31/1/24, 4:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, that is correct. If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
31/1/24, 4:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
31/1/24, 4:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
31/1/24, 4:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
31/1/24, 4:32 PM - +263 77 352 0743: We will discuss and inform you tomorrow
31/1/24, 5:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please, however, there is more to the plan. Allow me to help you understand it better. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
31/1/24, 5:12 PM - +263 77 262 6800: Yes, it is
31/1/24, 6:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
31/1/24, 6:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
31/1/24, 6:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
1/2/24, 12:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Deryling. I hope you are all doing great today!

I was hoping to get a response form your end yesterday, but it seems like due to some reason we were unable to connect. May I know if you were able to go through my previous messages?
1/2/24, 12:55 PM - +263 77 352 0743: It is good idea ,but at the moment we have a challenge,Daddy is diabetic and now have been disgonosed of kidney failure,so he is suppose to go dialysis which is very expensive here,as soon as we settle the matter we will cope with you.
1/2/24, 2:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am so sorry to hear that. I hope that he is able to recover soon. How have you and your family been holding up in the past few days?
1/2/24, 4:35 PM - +263 77 352 0743: Things have been tight but we pulling through with our daily efforts,With God on our side ,we have gone yhis far.
2/2/24, 12:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Derylin.

I hope you are all well on that end. Kindly excuse me for not being able to respond to your last message as our operational hours had concluded by then.
2/2/24, 12:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. It must really be a difficult situation for you. I hope that god gives you and your family the strength to cope up with this situation. I am hoping that with the medical treatment, your father's situation will improve soon.
2/2/24, 12:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand that dialysis is a long-term treatment, and that you are currently facing financial challenges as well. Moving forward, it is going to become a part of your essential finances as it is not a one-time expense. The dialysis treatment is surely the most important expense for you currently, however, I am sure that you agree that planning for Derylin's higher education in this situation is also important, right?

Thinking from a long-term perspective, if you are able to plan and adjust your finances accordingly this early on, it will be very beneficial for you when it is time for Derylin to take admission into college. Once she is able to complete her higher education and gets employed, she will also be able to contribute to your expenses and help you and your family live a better life. I am sure you agree with my perspective ma'am?
2/2/24, 12:41 PM - +263 77 352 0743: Sure
2/2/24, 1:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad that you agree with it ma'am. May I know what are your thoughts on this?
