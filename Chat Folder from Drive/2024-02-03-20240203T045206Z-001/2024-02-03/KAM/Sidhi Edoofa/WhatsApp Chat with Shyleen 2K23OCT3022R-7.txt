29/12/23, 4:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Shyleen

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. It has been a while since the last time we were connected with each other. As I was occupied with university obligations and Christmas preparations, I would like to take this opportunity to inquire how you are doing today?
29/12/23, 4:06 PM - +263 71 554 0651: We're fine thanks and how are you doing.
29/12/23, 4:23 PM - +263 78 909 8049: we are fine, how about you
29/12/23, 4:41 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great too, thank you for asking. If you are ready shall we now proceed with the session with the admission porcess?
29/12/23, 5:31 PM - +263 71 554 0651: Yes please
29/12/23, 5:32 PM - +263 77 336 8037: We are blessed thank you and how are you doing
29/12/23, 5:32 PM - +263 77 336 8037: Yes we can proceed
29/12/23, 6:01 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Since you are active now, I wanted to know if you were able to recall our past discussions about the admission process so that we can proceed with the session smoothly?
29/12/23, 6:03 PM - +263 77 336 8037: Yes we do
29/12/23, 6:04 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
29/12/23, 6:08 PM - +263 77 336 8037: Yes sir ,but I want to know if we still continue deposing on the same account number or?
29/12/23, 6:21 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: We can also share you with multiple account options for that. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know by when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
29/12/23, 6:24 PM - +263 77 336 8037: I'm Shyleen' s mom sir I'm the one asking we have already discussed and since it's end of the month I wanted to know if we can continue depositing on that account number that we have

29/12/23, 6:40 PM - +263 77 336 8037: Okay thanks we will continue with the one that we have thank you🙏
29/12/23, 6:50 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you on 2nd of January to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.

9/1/24, 9:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test. This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
9/1/24, 9:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?

If I talk about myself, I have made a resolution to bring more humility in myself and bring about a change in my perspective to be a better version of myself all while ensuring that I help all of our students to achieve their educational goals. With that said, I would like to know what aspirations or a change in your approach towards life you wish to achieve?

We will be able to help you only if we can connect timely and have healthy discussions.
12/1/24, 4:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, this is something I want to inform you all that the agenda for the discussions, that we are going to have, is to help you all understand the process you will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since you are going to be occupied with school and your parents are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
12/1/24, 4:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January].

Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your input and find the right time for our sessions.

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa*. Recently I was having a discussion with the Academic Board. They highlighted  that you have not been able to proceed with your admission process in a timely manner, since your child is at school and you have been occupied with work. Hence, I pitched in that I will be able to help you out and take over your application profile so that together we can ensure a timely and smooth progress. Since my operational hours accommodate your timings more suitably, I will be assuming the duties of your admission officer. I am optimistic that together, we can pave the way for an auspicious beginning to your academic journey, resulting in the right career prospects and eventual success for both you and your family.

Since this is the first time we are interacting, allow me to introduce myself. I am Miss Siddhi Singh, your Admission Officer.

27/1/24, 3:32 PM - +263 71 554 0651: Point of correction this January payment is the second month since we deposited $150 on December that was the first. So we have two months that we paid so far.
27/1/24, 4:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for the warm welcome. I was going through Shyleen's application profile and it is my understanding that you have successfully been introduced to Edoofa's Financial Secure Plan and you have already made the first deposit for the month of January. May I know if I am correct?
27/1/24, 4:30 PM - +263 71 554 0651: January is the second month of payment,, first payment was done on December.
27/1/24, 4:45 PM - +263 78 909 8049: This message was deleted
27/1/24, 5:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand, thank you for letting me know that. I understand that Shyleen has school during the weekdays and you are occupied with work. In such a case, I want to ensure that our sessions are held in a timely and smooth manner so we can comfortably proceed with your application process and the financial plan. Could you kindly suggest a 1-hour slot between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM when we can have our sessions?
27/1/24, 5:16 PM - +263 78 909 8049: <Media omitted>
27/1/24, 5:16 PM - +263 78 909 8049: So, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Let me explain how:

Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months. Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
27/1/24, 5:18 PM - +263 77 336 8037: This message was deleted
27/1/24, 5:18 PM - +263 71 554 0651: I think 5pm is okay for the sessions
27/1/24, 5:22 PM - +263 78 909 8049: 5pm is okay thats when l will be back from school
27/1/24, 5:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Rest assured I have taken a note of the same and we will discuss it in detail on Monday during our session.
27/1/24, 5:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our operational hours end at 5:00 PM, could you kindly let me know of a time slot before 5:00 PM so that we can coordinate and ensure a timely progress in your application?
27/1/24, 5:37 PM - +263 78 909 8049: This message was deleted
27/1/24, 5:43 PM - +263 78 909 8049: lets try at 2pm
27/1/24, 5:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. In such a case, we will conclude our conversation for today and reconnect on Monday at 2:00 PM for further discussion about your application profile. Until then, please take care and kindly extend my regards to your family as well.
27/1/24, 8:31 PM - +263 71 554 0651: Thank we will try to be available.

29/1/24, 2:59 PM - +263 77 336 8037: This message was deleted
29/1/24, 3:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am doing fine too, thank you for asking. Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held last week, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
29/1/24, 4:13 PM - +263 78 909 8049: l dont know what it is ma'am
29/1/24, 4:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
29/1/24, 4:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
29/1/24, 4:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
29/1/24, 4:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me share a glimpse of the conference with you and your family. I am certain that Shyleen too would be this excited to attend such events when he comes to India.

29/1/24, 4:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me know once you are able to go through the messages about the SLICE CON, along with the images and videos shared with you. This was indeed a momentous step for all of our students, making them employable ready and giving them access to the right opportunities for their careers ahead.
29/1/24, 4:43 PM - +263 77 336 8037: That's so nice and encouraging
29/1/24, 4:53 PM - +263 78 909 8049: indeed ma'am that's great
29/1/24, 5:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly. Also, regarding the discussion we had the other day about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
29/1/24, 5:40 PM - +263 78 909 8049: no they didn't have queries
29/1/24, 5:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As much as I would like to continue with our discussion, since my operational hours for the day have already concluded, I would like to reconnect with you tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the Financial Secure Plan and admission process. Until then, please take care and have a blessed day ahead!
30/1/24, 10:28 AM - +263 71 554 0651: I'm not familiar with that
30/1/24, 10:34 AM - +263 71 554 0651: Nice thanks for sharing the experience.
30/1/24, 10:40 AM - +263 71 554 0651: There were no queries as such, it's a good plan but my only concern was about the extra charge when depositing that $150 to the bank.
30/1/24, 11:24 AM - +263 71 554 0651: Since the financial secure plan is mandatory I don't know if there is another way of reducing that cost because 12% is a bit too much. That's my only worry.
30/1/24, 12:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Shyleen. I hope everything is well on your end. Thank you for sharing your concern with me. I understand please. I would like to highlight that the payment mode being provided by us are done through local associates who offer to help in making payments through their bank accounts, which has 12.5% international transfer charges. If you have to make the same payment through your own bank account, the international transfer charges are at least 18%.
30/1/24, 12:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moreover, keeping your finances in mind, we also offer a waiver of your remaining $150 enrollment fee. These additional benefits can be availed through the Financial Secure Plan, and we have carefully introduced this plan for the students to ensure that they do not face any financial burden by the time they arrive in India for their higher education. I hope this was helpful in clearing your query regarding the payment charges?
30/1/24, 1:08 PM - +263 71 554 0651: Okay thank you I now do understand and thank you for breaking this down for me.
30/1/24, 1:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that this was helpful. For the current round of students, there are only 27 seats available for the students who can benefit from the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. 

Since you have been one of the most dedicated students, and I see you have great aspirations, I wanted you to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.
30/1/24, 1:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of January, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
30/1/24, 1:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
30/1/24, 2:10 PM - +263 77 336 8037: It's a bit difficult to put a fixed date ma'am since this side our pay dates are not always on the same specific day every month ,so how about any day between the last day of the month and the first week of the following month?
30/1/24, 2:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In such a case, would it be helpful if you choose a date at the end of the month i.e., 30th of every month?
30/1/24, 2:48 PM - +263 77 336 8037: I understand ma'am ,but choosing the date will be a problem because sometimes we get paid before or after the 30th. If I may ask , what will happen if we choose the 30th and then it happens that we get paid on the 3rd of the month?
30/1/24, 3:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In such a case, do you think it would be suitable for you to set the date as the 7th of every month? This way, you will be able to pay the deposit on time regardless of whether you are getting paid at the end of every month or the beginning of the following month.
30/1/24, 3:23 PM - +263 77 336 8037: Thats great!, then let us choose the 5th of every month
30/1/24, 3:36 PM - +263 77 336 8037: Since we have already paid for January which means for February we are going to pay on the 5th of March am I correct?
30/1/24, 4:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct. Thank you for sharing these details, your commitment to securing a seat in this exclusive program is appreciated.

To proceed with the next steps, we will be sharing an official agreement detailing the specifics of the Financial Secure Plan along with its benefits. This agreement is a crucial document that outlines the terms and conditions of your participation in the program. It serves as a legal framework ensuring transparency and mutual understanding between all parties involved.
30/1/24, 4:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As we prepare to send you the agreement, we kindly request the following details to personalize the document:

1. Full Name of Parent/Guardian/Sponsor responsible for catering to the student's finances [The representative in whose name you want the agreement to be]


2. Residential Address of the aforementioned representative.

31/1/24, 4:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 4:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Please take the time to thoroughly review each point in the agreement. If there are any sections that you find unclear or need further clarification, please make a note of them. We want to ensure that you fully understand the terms and conditions before proceeding.

31/1/24, 5:16 PM - +263 71 554 0651: Understood.
31/1/24, 5:21 PM - +263 71 554 0651: Looking at the table of instalments per month December is not included I just want to know if the $150 that we paid on December 7th was added to enrollment fee to make it $350 or it is the one that was waived from enrollment fee? I don't know if my question is clear?
31/1/24, 6:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. The payment you had made in the month of December will be counted towards your enrollment fee itself. The $150 waiver will be adjusted towards the end of the plan. I hope this helps with your query?
31/1/24, 8:11 PM - +263 71 554 0651: I'm a bit lost because the first message said the balance that we were due to pay which was $150 will be waived that is why I asked, so how towards the end?
31/1/24, 8:29 PM - +263 77 336 8037: Sorry ma'am I'm confused now because after paying the $200 for enrollment fee we had a balance of $150 ,then we were advised about financial secure plan before we even pay the $150 which we were due to pay on or before the 7th of December and now it's is said that the money is counted towards our enrollment fee itself how?may you please help us to understand about how will the $150 waiver be adjusted towards the end of the plan.🙏
1/2/24, 10:23 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Shyleen. I hope you are all doing wonderful today!

Kindly excuse me for being unable to respond to your message last night, as our operational hours had already concluded. I understand please, allow me to help you understand it better.
1/2/24, 10:27 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As per the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, your remaining balance from the enrollment fee of $150 will be waived off. Since you have already made the payment towards enrollment fee, we will record it against the enrollment fee itself, and the 10th month of your Financial Secure Plan i.e., November will be waived off to adjust the balance. May I know if you are following? <This message was edited>
1/2/24, 10:34 AM - +263 77 336 8037: Okay ma'am I'm following that means October will be waved off for us as it is our 10th month right.
1/2/24, 11:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for misstating your last month as November. You are correct, your last month of payment is October, which will be waived off. It is important to remember that in order to claim the waiver, consistency is important. I am sure you must have gone through all the details mentioned in the agreement, right?
1/2/24, 11:52 AM - +263 71 554 0651: Okay if that is the case I understand.
1/2/24, 12:22 PM - +263 77 336 8037: <Media omitted>
1/2/24, 12:36 PM - +263 77 336 8037: <Media omitted>
1/2/24, 12:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. You are saying that you will not be able to raise the amount within such a short span of time, and I understand. Since you have already paid $150 in January, the same will be reflected as your first installment starting from the month of February. This way, there will be no gaps or question of confusion moving forward. Because of this, you final month of plan will be changed from October to November. May I know if you find this suitable? <This message was edited>
1/2/24, 1:28 PM - +263 77 336 8037: Maybe the date that we choose is the one that makes things difficult if I may ask,let's say we chose the last day of every month when was our next payment be?
1/2/24, 2:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. According to the current plan, you will have to make the next payment on March 5th. If you choose the monthly deposit date to be the end of every month i.e., 30th, in such a case your next payment will be due on March 30th. May I know if this is suitable for you?
1/2/24, 2:30 PM - +263 77 336 8037: What about month-end February?
1/2/24, 2:39 PM - +263 77 336 8037: The thing is I'm trying to choose the date that won't open but close the gap between so that our next installment will reflect as the second installment not the first
1/2/24, 4:03 PM - +263 77 336 8037: Or let's just mantain the same date that we paid in January so that there is no gap and our next installment plan will be on 26 February and on ....how is that?. Then my question now is what will happen if the 26 is on Sunday when no bank is open?i.e 26 May will be on a Sunday.
1/2/24, 4:13 PM - +263 71 554 0651: This message was deleted
1/2/24, 4:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Thank you for elaborating your concern. I would like to inform you that the date you are choosing is deadline for that particular installment. You can make the payment anytime between your previous deadline and the next deadline, and your payment will be reflected against your upcoming deadline. Allow me to help you understand it better with the following example:
1/2/24, 4:17 PM - +263 77 336 8037: Okay give us an example
1/2/24, 4:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Your upcoming deadline for the month of February is 26th for example and you have already made the payment for the previous month i.e., January. In such a case, if you make the next $150 payment between 26 January and 26 February, it will be reflected as your payment for the month of February. You can also choose to pay in advance.

For example, you happen to have the budget to pay $200 in the month of March , in such a case, the balance can be adjusted for the next month, and you will be required to pay $100 in the month of April.
1/2/24, 4:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you wish to begin the plan from the month of January and also wish to pay in February, in such a case we can change your deposit date towards the end of the month, and for all the following months you will be required to make the payment on or before the same date.

If you choose 26th as your deposit date, the deadline for your next deposit will be 26 February, following with 26th March as the subsequent deadline and so on. May I know if this is more suitable for you?
1/2/24, 4:29 PM - +263 77 336 8037: This message was deleted
1/2/24, 9:55 PM - +263 71 554 0651: Okay noted
1/2/24, 10:00 PM - +263 71 554 0651: Yes 26th is fine with us so February we will pay on 26th.
Just to confirm are you saying it is possible that we can pay before 26th if it happens that we get cash before 26th, I had as if you said so in your example if I'm not mistaken?
