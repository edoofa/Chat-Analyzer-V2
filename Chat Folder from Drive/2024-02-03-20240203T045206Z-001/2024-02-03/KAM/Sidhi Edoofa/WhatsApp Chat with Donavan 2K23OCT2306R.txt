26/1/24, 9:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Donovan,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa*. Recently I was having a discussion with the Academic Board. They highlighted  that you have not been able to proceed with your admission process in a timely manner, since your child is at school and you have been occupied with work. Hence, I pitched in that I will be able to help you out and take over your application profile so that together we can ensure a timely and smooth progress. Since my operational hours accommodate your timings more suitably, I will be assuming the duties of your admission officer. I am optimistic that together, we can pave the way for an auspicious beginning to your academic journey, resulting in the right career prospects and eventual success for both you and your family.
26/1/24, 9:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

27/1/24, 3:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you for asking. I have added the number to the group. Since this is the first time we are interacting, allow me to introduce myself. I am Miss Siddhi Singh, your Admission Officer.

27/1/24, 5:40 PM - +263 78 132 1644: Thank you for adding me
27/1/24, 5:40 PM - +263 78 132 1644: How are you all
27/1/24, 5:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We are well. Thank you for asking. I understand that Donovan has school during the weekdays and you are occupied with work. In such a case, I want to ensure that our sessions are held in a timely and smooth manner so we can comfortably proceed with your application process. Could you kindly suggest a 1-hour slot between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM when we can have our sessions?
27/1/24, 6:31 PM - +263 78 321 9879: I think 1300 to 1400 will be ohk because at school I dismiss at 1700 so that is the only time I can get in between the specified time
29/1/24, 9:36 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Donovan. I hope you are all doing well. Thank you for letting me know of your availability. I will reach out to you again at 1:00 PM today to further discuss the process. I hope you have a great day ahead!
29/1/24, 9:43 AM - +263 78 132 1644: Good marning
29/1/24, 10:07 AM - +263 78 321 9879: Thank you
29/1/24, 1:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Donavan. I hope you are all doing well. How has your day been going so far?
29/1/24, 1:23 PM - +263 78 321 9879: It has not been bad at all
29/1/24, 1:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that. I was going through Donavan's application profile and it is my understanding that you have successfully completed the 2nd step of the admission cycle i.e., Statement of Purpose. May I know if I am correct?
29/1/24, 1:45 PM - +263 78 321 9879: Yes you are correct
29/1/24, 1:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Biomedical Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
29/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 78 321 9879: Yes it is accurate
29/1/24, 2:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
29/1/24, 2:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
29/1/24, 2:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
29/1/24, 3:21 PM - +263 78 321 9879: Yes I am
29/1/24, 3:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
29/1/24, 3:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
29/1/24, 3:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
29/1/24, 3:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
29/1/24, 3:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
29/1/24, 3:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
29/1/24, 5:02 PM - +263 78 321 9879: Indeed it is
29/1/24, 5:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
29/1/24, 5:58 PM - +263 78 132 1644: You are welcome
29/1/24, 6:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As much as I would like to continue with our discussion, since my operational hours for the day have already concluded and I have had a long day, I would like to reconnect with you tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the admission process. Until then, please take care and have a blessed day ahead!
29/1/24, 6:30 PM - +263 78 321 9879: Yes please
29/1/24, 8:48 PM - +263 78 132 1644: Thank you
30/1/24, 1:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Donavan. I hope everything is well on your end. Before we proceed with our discussion today, I would like to check in on you and your family. How are you all doing today?
30/1/24, 1:46 PM - +263 78 321 9879: I am doing well. Thank you for checking
30/1/24, 1:47 PM - +263 78 132 1644: We are doing very well
30/1/24, 2:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are all doing well. During our previous interaction, we were discussing how Edoofa's Financial Secure Plan works. As you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
30/1/24, 2:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
30/1/24, 2:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
30/1/24, 2:37 PM - +263 78 321 9879: Yes I do
30/1/24, 3:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
30/1/24, 3:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
30/1/24, 3:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
30/1/24, 3:23 PM - +263 78 132 1644: Yes we are agree
30/1/24, 3:26 PM - +263 78 132 1644: Well understood
30/1/24, 3:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
30/1/24, 3:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
30/1/24, 3:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
30/1/24, 3:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
30/1/24, 4:26 PM - +263 78 132 1644: We are together
30/1/24, 5:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
30/1/24, 5:20 PM - +263 78 321 9879: Yes please
30/1/24, 5:34 PM - +263 78 132 1644: Yes
30/1/24, 6:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion, however, my operational hours for the day have concluded. Let us reconnect tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the Financial Secure Plan. I wish you a blessed day ahead! <This message was edited>
30/1/24, 6:24 PM - +263 78 132 1644: Thank you
31/1/24, 1:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Donavan. I hope you are having a wonderful day. How are you all doing today?
31/1/24, 1:26 PM - +263 78 321 9879: I am doing good thank you
31/1/24, 1:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am fine too, thank you for asking. In our last interaction, we were discussing about the details of the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay before your due date.
31/1/24, 1:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
31/1/24, 1:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
31/1/24, 2:26 PM - +263 78 321 9879: We first paid 200 then we also paid the 150 within the specified time. I did send the receipts
31/1/24, 2:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. I have taken a note of the same. If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
31/1/24, 2:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
31/1/24, 2:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
31/1/24, 2:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
31/1/24, 3:15 PM - +263 78 321 9879: It's actually great
31/1/24, 4:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
31/1/24, 4:14 PM - +263 78 132 1644: Well understood
31/1/24, 4:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
31/1/24, 4:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
31/1/24, 4:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
31/1/24, 5:01 PM - +263 78 132 1644: It sounds so good
31/1/24, 5:29 PM - +263 78 321 9879: Yes it is
31/1/24, 5:32 PM - +263 78 321 9879: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 5:32 PM - +263 78 321 9879: <Media omitted>
1/2/24, 11:01 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Donavan. I hope you are all doing great today!

Kindly excuse me for being unable to respond to your message last night, as our operational hours had already concluded. I see that you have reshared your enrollment fee payment receipts. We have already updated your payment records, and have successfully marked your enrollment fee payment as complete.
1/2/24, 12:53 PM - +263 78 321 9879: That is great. Thank you
1/2/24, 1:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Continuing our previous conversation, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
1/2/24, 1:26 PM - +263 78 321 9879: Yes I have
1/2/24, 3:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
2/2/24, 2:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Donavan

Please, how are you doing today? With regards to our discussion yesterday, I wanted to reach out and enquire if you are available for us to have a brief conversation?
2/2/24, 2:25 PM - +263 78 132 1644: Yes
2/2/24, 2:25 PM - +263 78 132 1644: Good after noon
2/2/24, 3:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are doing well and are available for us to connect with each other. Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held last week, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
2/2/24, 6:29 PM - +263 78 321 9879: Nor at all
2/2/24, 6:30 PM - +263 78 321 9879: Please pardon me for not being available for the discussion today. I had a very busy day
2/2/24, 8:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
2/2/24, 8:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
2/2/24, 8:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
2/2/24, 8:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me share a glimpse of the conference with you and your family. I am certain that you too would be this excited to attend such events when he comes to India.
2/2/24, 8:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This was indeed a momentous step for all of our students, making them employable ready and giving them access to the right opportunities for their careers ahead. Kindly go through the messages about the SLICE CON, along with the images and videos shared with you. We will reconnect tomorrow to further discuss about the Financial Secure Plan.

I wish you a blessed night!
2/2/24, 9:07 PM - +263 78 321 9879: Thank you
