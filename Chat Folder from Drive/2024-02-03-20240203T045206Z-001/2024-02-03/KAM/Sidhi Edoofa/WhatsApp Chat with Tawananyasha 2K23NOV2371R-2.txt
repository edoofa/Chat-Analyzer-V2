26/1/24, 9:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Tawananyasha,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa*. Recently I was having a discussion with the Academic Board. They highlighted  that you have not been able to proceed with your admission process in a timely manner, since your child is at school and you have been occupied with work. Hence, I pitched in that I will be able to help you out and take over your application profile so that together we can ensure a timely and smooth progress. Since my operational hours accommodate your timings more suitably, I will be assuming the duties of your admission officer. I am optimistic that together, we can pave the way for an auspicious beginning to your academic journey, resulting in the right career prospects and eventual success for both you and your family.

27/1/24, 6:33 AM - +263 78 575 1120: Hope you took note of this message
27/1/24, 9:01 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tawananyasha. I hope you are having a lovely morning. How are you all today?
27/1/24, 9:05 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that information with me. However, I am unable to view the previous message. Could you be kind enough to reshare the same with me?
27/1/24, 7:26 PM - +263 78 575 1120: Mr Dev how are you ,hope I find you well.Please accept my sincere apology as Tawananyasha cannot continue with the Edoofa scholarship .

There has been a change of plans beyond our control for her.But we thank Edoofa for having offered her this scholarship opportunity .

We.would have loved her to come and study in India but new plans cannot allow her anymore.My apologies once more.
29/1/24, 9:44 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tawananyasha. I hope you are all doing well today. Thank you for resharing the message with me and for sharing that information with me. I was going through Tawananyasha's profile, and was quite impressed because with her profile she will be eligible for a good scholarship opportunity from the universities. May I know what has caused this change in plans?
29/1/24, 8:33 PM - +263 77 234 0173: Good evening Mr Sing, sorry for lthe ate response .I am.Tawana's Mother.

The issue is Tawana in the first place wanted to do medicine but because she isn't doing Physics at school  we were told she cannot pursue Medicinein India..So we had  then opted MLT for her .But now she has gotten another opportunity  to do Medicine without the Physics.

So she has gotten a chance to pursue Medicine she always  wanted from the beginning. We were so happy to have been elected for the scholarship but  MLT wasn't her passion.

That's the only reason the plans had to changed Mr Sing and we are sorry for that.
1/2/24, 1:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tawananyasha.

I hope you are all doing great today. Thank you for sharing that information with me. I understand please. If I may ask, has Tawananyasha gotten the opportunity to pursue medicine in India or back in Zimbabwe?
1/2/24, 1:39 PM - +263 77 234 0173: Good afternoon , not in India  because they said Physics it's a must. So she will go to Zambia and Zimbabwe is our last option in the worst case scenario.
1/2/24, 4:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that information with me. However, if I am correct, Tawananyasha is supposed to sit for her A-Level examinations in 2024, right? In order to pursue medicine in Zimbabwe, you are required to have at least 15 points in your A-Level examinations. Could you kindly help me understand if she has already gotten the opportunity to pursue medicine?
1/2/24, 4:19 PM - +263 77 234 0173: Yes she will be sitting for her A Level this year. Zambia does pre-med for one year if one didnt do all 4 subjects at A Level.For girls in Zimbabwe they lower the bar a bit ,15points is for boys.
1/2/24, 4:22 PM - +263 77 234 0173: Besides the Zambia route we are still looking for other avenues. I really would have really  loved her to come to India.
2/2/24, 10:13 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tawananyasha.

I hope you are having a lovely morning. Thank you for sharing that information with me. If I may ask, have you been able to conduct research about these universities and apply to any of the them yet? <This message was edited>
2/2/24, 10:27 AM - +263 77 234 0173: Good morning  , yes I have spoken to some students I know who are already there and some agents as well who deal with the Universities.
2/2/24, 10:28 AM - +263 77 234 0173: I can only  apply when they are open for 2025 admissions
2/2/24, 11:14 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Since Tawananyasha is such a bright student with straight As in her report cards, I am sure that you must be thoroughly researching about the universities before applying for them. Through her hard work and dedication, she has built an academic profile that makes her stand out in the crowd and she deserves to enroll into a good university for her higher education. May I know if you have been able to shortlist any universities, and if so, could you kindly share the same with me?
2/2/24, 11:24 AM - +263 77 234 0173: I also feel the same too .Below are the Universities i will choose from among the following, University of Lusaka, Lusaka Apex, Textiles, Levy Mwanawasa,
2/2/24, 11:24 AM - +263 77 234 0173: I have to balance the good part of the University and affordability as well
2/2/24, 1:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand ma'am. Pursuing medicine can be a very expensive deal, and it is important to balance quality and affordability. Since Tawananyasha will undergo the 1 year pre-med course, that will mean that she will be studying for the next 6 years. If we include the internship period in order to get her license for practising, it will be a total of 7 years. Since Tawananyasha has such a strong motivation towards pursuing medicine, I am sure she will be willing to go ahead with the same, am I correct?
2/2/24, 1:28 PM - +263 77 234 0173: Thts her passion so am.pretty sure she can do whatever it takes  to become a Medical Doctor .
2/2/24, 1:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Hard work and dedication is really important, especially for a student who wishes to pursue medicine. Since you mentioned that she is looking for opportunities in Zambia, it got me wondering if they will be suitable for her. I happened to come across this review from a person with a Zambian nationality. <This message was edited>
2/2/24, 1:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/2/24, 1:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you agree with me when I say that when you pursue medicine, having infrastructure is a very important factor, as the real learning lies in practice and not just theory. Having said that, I also happened to come across this news article that informs how 700 doctors did not get employment in Zambia, even though the government had the budget for it.
2/2/24, 1:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: https://www.lusakatimes.com/2022/01/10/its-scandalous-for-zambia-not-to-employ-the-700-doctors-but-money-to-urgently-employ-district-commissioners/
2/2/24, 1:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This makes me unsure about the quality of education of medicine in a country that does not have proper infrastructure for medical practitioners and job opportunities.
2/2/24, 1:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If I may ask, do you happen to have eye clinics, hospitals, pediatrician clinics nearby where you live?
2/2/24, 1:55 PM - +263 77 234 0173: I hear you but Zambia will be just for studying then she can always look for opportunities elsewhere.
2/2/24, 1:57 PM - +263 77 234 0173: I live close to town .Yes
2/2/24, 2:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. But my concern is, if the country is unable to invest properly in the health infrastructure for the country that they will be able to offer quality education.

If I may ask, since Tawananyasha has such a strong inclination towards medicine, does she have a specialization in her mind?
2/2/24, 2:14 PM - +263 77 234 0173: I hear your concern .She is still.deciding on specialisation
2/2/24, 2:17 PM - +263 77 234 0173: We are still scouting and if we find something better like a scholarship outside our region we will still go for it
2/2/24, 2:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Has she thought about which field she wants to be in? For example pharmaceutical companies, public health agencies, research institutions, etc.?
