16/1/24, 1:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Takundanashe,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 1:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 77 384 0518: Sure noted will send the results by end of day tomorrow

17/1/24, 8:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Takundanashe.

Thank you for sharing your results with us. I noticed that your A-level results didn't turn out as we had hoped, particularly with the challenge in two subjects. However, I want to take a moment to remind you that this result is not a reflection of your abilities or potential. It's simply a hurdle on your academic journey, one that you are more than capable of overcoming.
17/1/24, 8:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It's important to remember that everyone faces setbacks at some point. What matters most is how we respond to them. This is an opportunity for growth and learning. Reflect on the experience, identify areas for improvement, and use this as a stepping stone towards future successes.
17/1/24, 8:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Rest assured, that you have Edoofa’s full support in navigating this phase. Whether it's discussing options for retaking the exam, exploring alternative career paths, or just needing someone to guide you, we are here for you. 

I have taken note of your results and I will add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
17/1/24, 8:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly allow us some time to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, we will reconnect with you to discuss the next steps in your academic journey.
18/1/24, 12:39 AM - +263 77 384 0518: Noted with thanks  looking forward for reconnection
2/2/24, 11:54 AM - +263 77 384 0518: Good day to you if I may ask when will  we know that our daughter has been accepted by the university.  Not yet received  the offer letter.
