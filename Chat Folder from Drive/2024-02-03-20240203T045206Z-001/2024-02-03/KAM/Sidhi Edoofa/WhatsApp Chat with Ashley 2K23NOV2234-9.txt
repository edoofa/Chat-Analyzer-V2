21/12/23, 7:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Along with these forms, I have asked you to share your academic documents with us. I am currently waiting for that we well.

Moving forward, as a part of your application file, you will need to visit your school and secure a letter of recommendation from them. We have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process.
21/12/23, 7:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, your subject combination for A Level exams, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
21/12/23, 7:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to enquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?
21/12/23, 7:15 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Ummmm ,  I think for this one you may give me some time , so that I can talk to the school authority

21/12/23, 8:04 PM - +263 71 596 3939: I am sure I'll talk to them on Monday
21/12/23, 8:24 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Very well, I shall wait on the same.

28/12/23, 9:37 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Okae sir
29/12/23, 6:13 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well today. May I know if you are currently available to proceed with the session for the admission process?
29/12/23, 6:54 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Good evening sir
29/12/23, 6:54 PM - +263 71 596 3939: I am ready Sir
29/12/23, 7:50 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
29/12/23, 7:50 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
29/12/23, 7:57 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Yes sir
29/12/23, 7:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
29/12/23, 7:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
29/12/23, 8:00 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Ok sir go on
29/12/23, 8:02 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Yes sir
29/12/23, 8:02 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
29/12/23, 8:02 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
29/12/23, 8:04 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Yes sir they are clear
29/12/23, 8:23 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?

1/2/24, 4:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ashley.

I was unable to respond to your message last night as our operational hours had concluded. Before we proceed with our discussion, how are you all doing today?
1/2/24, 4:56 PM - +263 77 690 4354: Good afternoon mam
1/2/24, 4:56 PM - +263 71 596 3939: I'm fine mam how are you
2/2/24, 4:22 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Good afternoon mam
2/2/24, 4:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ashley.

I hope you are having a wonderful day. Kindly excuse me for not being able to respond to your message last night as our team is currently working tirelessly towards the preparation of our upcoming Zimbabwe trip in the month of February. Before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to ask how are you doing today?
2/2/24, 4:47 PM - +263 71 596 3939: I am fine mam , how about you
2/2/24, 4:52 PM - +263 71 596 3939: <Media omitted>
2/2/24, 5:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that Ashley. I am fine too, thank you for asking. Mr. Rithvik is the HOD of the DSW department of Edoofa. Our team is currently preparing for the upcoming Zimbabwe trip in the month of February, and he has reached out to you to share some details regarding the same.
2/2/24, 5:19 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Okay okay mam for letting me know..
2/2/24, 5:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome Ashley. During our previous conversation, you had confirmed your course and year of intake.
2/2/24, 5:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
2/2/24, 5:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
2/2/24, 5:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
2/2/24, 5:57 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Yaah sure mam
2/2/24, 7:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
2/2/24, 7:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
2/2/24, 7:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
2/2/24, 7:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
2/2/24, 7:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
2/2/24, 7:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
2/2/24, 7:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Since our operational hours have concluded and I have had a long day already, let us conclude our conversation on this note. Kindly go through the above points and we will reconnect tomorrow to continue with our discussion about the Financial Secure Plan.

I wish you a blessed night!
