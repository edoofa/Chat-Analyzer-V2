*3. EWYL Program Instructions and Pledge Document:* In the form, you will find a section where you are required to specify the date on which you intend to commence your EWYL journey. The next batch is scheduled to start on *Tuesday (30 January 2024)* . If you are enthusiastic about beginning the procedures on that particular date, please fill it in accordingly.

24/1/24, 11:45 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The column "orientation availability" refers to a 3-day window following the commencement of your EWYL program, which, in your case, is on January 30. After the initiation, you will have a 3-day period during which you will commence your EWYL orientation, specifically from January 30 to February 3 in your situation. Your EWYL program initiation date remains January 30, and you are required to input a date between January 30 and February 3 for your Orientation program. It is permissible for both the EWYL Program availability and Orientation availability to share the same date. If you are available for the orientation on January 30 itself, kindly indicate so. I hope I am clear?
24/1/24, 11:57 AM - +263 77 405 9607: Yaa I Wii be available mam
24/1/24, 11:58 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well, then you may mention both the EWYL Program Availability date and Orientation Availability date as 30 January 2024.
24/1/24, 11:58 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Along with these forms, I had asked you to share your academic documents with us. I am currently waiting for that as well.

Moving forward, as a part of your application file, you will need to visit your school and secure a letter of recommendation from them. We have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process.
24/1/24, 11:58 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 11:59 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, *your subject combination for A Level exams*, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
24/1/24, 11:59 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to inquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?
24/1/24, 12:31 PM - +263 77 405 9607: I think by Friday we will hv received the letter of recommendation from the school
24/1/24, 12:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that and I am looking forward to getting an update from your end. I would also like to reiterate that our operational hours are from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Central African Time.
24/1/24, 12:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Considering this, for our future sessions, you have to decide on an hour’s time that suits your availability within this timeframe and share the same with us so that we can tailor our subsequent sessions to accommodate your schedule effectively.
24/1/24, 12:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For the next couple of days, we will have sessions on a daily basis and once we cover the first three steps of the admission cycle, we will have sessions scheduled on a need basis. Hence, can you let me know at what time you would like us to schedule our sessions on a daily basis (between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM)?
24/1/24, 12:47 PM - +263 77 405 9607: I think 10am will be the best tym mam
24/1/24, 12:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. In such a case, we will schedule tomorrow’s session at this time. It's important to note that all three forms and your academic documents with the Letter of recommendation should be completed and submitted by tomorrow before our session. 

This timeline is essential to ensure a smooth progression in the admission process and to meet the goal of concluding this session before Saturday, enabling us to assist you in initiating your EWYL process on time. I hope we are together with this?
24/1/24, 12:55 PM - +263 77 405 9607: Understood mam bt as I hv said before iam still waiting for the school to prepare the documents if the school manage today definitely all the documents will be ready before tomorrow session [10am] the only setback is that letter only some of all the documents will be ready mam
24/1/24, 12:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, sir. I have taken a note of the same. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 10:00 AM for our next session.

25/1/24, 10:58 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
25/1/24, 11:01 AM - +263 77 405 9607: Ready mam
25/1/24, 11:06 AM - +263 77 405 9607: I will definitely
25/1/24, 11:12 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 11:15 AM - +263 77 405 9607: Yaa I understand
25/1/24, 11:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
25/1/24, 11:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
25/1/24, 11:26 AM - +263 77 405 9607: Yes mam
25/1/24, 11:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps - 

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
25/1/24, 11:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
25/1/24, 11:31 AM - +263 77 405 9607: Yes mam
25/1/24, 11:32 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
25/1/24, 11:32 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
25/1/24, 11:35 AM - +263 77 405 9607: Very clear mam
25/1/24, 11:37 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
25/1/24, 11:45 AM - +263 77 405 9607: They are videos that u you receive from the founder so that the student will get to know what it  means to be an edoofian and it provides quite a number of universities who are within the edoofa program so that the child will get a clear insight of what's going on in India before she goes there and it also provide a number of courses
25/1/24, 11:47 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are absolutely correct sir. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
25/1/24, 11:47 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?
25/1/24, 11:47 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
25/1/24, 11:48 AM - +263 77 405 9607: Yes mam

25/1/24, 1:10 PM - +263 77 405 9607: I think for tomorrow let's say 12pm
25/1/24, 1:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 12:00 pm for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to go through the videos. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed day ahead and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.

26/1/24, 12:51 PM - +263 77 405 9607: Ok thanks mam
26/1/24, 12:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Since Nokutenda is yet to appear for her A-Level examinations, as mentioned in the above shared message, it is necessary that the letter of recommendation highlights her subject combination for A-Level. Alternatively, if you have her Statement of Entry, you may share the same with us. <This message was edited>
26/1/24, 1:00 PM - +263 77 405 9607: The statement of entry is nt available at the moment coz the examination date hs nt yet been set so still waiting maybe we can advise the head of school to add the subject combination on the letter

26/1/24, 1:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is alright sir, it is a genuine mistake. You may take your time to resubmit the recommendation letter, and in the meanwhile, if you are ready, we can proceed with the session?

26/1/24, 1:51 PM - +263 77 405 9607: The fourth video is mainly about that Statement of purpose which is a letter prepared by Edoofa to make sure you easly get a place from universities [the recommend you to any college or universities , etc ] around India . In the SOP includes all the information that you hv shared with the counselor and all your abilities and skills that you might have so the stand on yo behalf until u get a scholarship.

26/1/24, 2:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding of the 4th video. May I know if you were also able to go through the first 3 videos?
26/1/24, 2:25 PM - +263 77 758 4433: Yes ww did.it is about schools ,colleges and universities. Edoifa invested a lot of time  identifying colleges and universities (10years) which suit this program. Students are encouraged to follow so as to prepare and be qualified for these institutions.
26/1/24, 2:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Amazing. I am glad to know that you were able to go through the videos so thoroughly and understand the founder's message. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  I hope you were able to follow through with this?
26/1/24, 2:49 PM - +263 77 758 4433: Yes we were
26/1/24, 2:57 PM - +263 77 758 4433: This is  a document which will convinced the admission board on why she is worthy of scholarship. It includes achievements, goals,abilities her vision,academic progress and any other exceptional qualities. This also involves the reasons she chose the course she wants to do and why she choose that particular university
26/1/24, 2:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move Nokutenda's application ahead and help her to write a proper statement of purpose so that she can get into the best University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on Nokutenda's application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, we would require Nokutenda's availability for approximately 30 minutes. If she is unavailable, she can provide you with her input, and you can proceed with the statement of purpose on her behalf.
26/1/24, 2:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in Nokutenda's admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

27/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 77 405 9607: Yaa she did
27/1/24, 1:38 PM - +263 77 405 9607: And it was shared in the morning on this platform
27/1/24, 1:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The 2nd task included answering 5 questions that are related to her course. For your reference, I have replied to that message in which I shared the task. May I know if you are following sir?

27/1/24, 1:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is alright sir, kindly do not apologize. I understand that she happened to overlook it. As long as she can send it here on the group by the end of the day, it is alright. In the meanwhile, we can proceed with our discussion if you are ready.
27/1/24, 1:56 PM - +263 77 405 9607: Yaa ready
27/1/24, 2:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: After Nokutenda shares the 2nd task, we will have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process. In the meanwhile, let us progress to the third step in your admission journey, i.e. *Introduction to Financial Secure Plan*.
27/1/24, 2:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, before we start the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
27/1/24, 2:13 PM - +263 77 758 4433: We are aware will do that before the 18th
27/1/24, 2:13 PM - +263 77 758 4433: Thanks for the reminder
27/1/24, 2:13 PM - +263 77 405 9607: Yaa we a on it we will try to meet the deadline
27/1/24, 2:14 PM - +263 77 405 9607: You welcome
27/1/24, 2:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better. 

In the meantime. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course Nokutenda has selected for her higher education is BA (Travel and Tourism) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
27/1/24, 2:18 PM - +263 77 405 9607: Yes it is
27/1/24, 2:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
27/1/24, 2:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
27/1/24, 2:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?

27/1/24, 3:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It's quite alright Nokutenda. Thank you for sharing the answers with me. I have duly taken a note of it.
27/1/24, 3:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
27/1/24, 3:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
27/1/24, 3:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
27/1/24, 3:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
27/1/24, 3:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
27/1/24, 3:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
27/1/24, 3:40 PM - +263 77 758 4433: Definitely a plan really needs to be in place
27/1/24, 3:41 PM - +263 77 405 9607: True
27/1/24, 3:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
27/1/24, 4:00 PM - +263 77 405 9607: Yes mam
27/1/24, 4:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
27/1/24, 4:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
27/1/24, 4:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
27/1/24, 4:04 PM - +263 77 405 9607: Yes mam
27/1/24, 4:05 PM - +263 77 758 4433: Very  well calculated and profound. A plan needs to be in place to avoid disappointments
27/1/24, 4:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
27/1/24, 4:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
27/1/24, 4:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
27/1/24, 4:38 PM - +263 77 405 9607: Well said and it's a very clear plan and easy to work with
27/1/24, 4:39 PM - +263 77 758 4433: Vera true
27/1/24, 5:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
27/1/24, 5:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
27/1/24, 5:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
27/1/24, 5:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
27/1/24, 5:14 PM - +263 77 405 9607: True that
27/1/24, 5:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you agree. However, as much as I would love to continue my conversation with you, my operational hours for the day have concluded and I have already had a long day. Could you kindly let me know of a suitable time on Monday when we can reconnect to further discuss the financial plan?
27/1/24, 5:30 PM - +263 77 405 9607: I think 12pm will be fine again
27/1/24, 5:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. In such a case, we will have our session on Monday at 12:00 PM. Until then, please take care and kindly extend my regards to your family as well.
27/1/24, 5:47 PM - +263 77 405 9607: Thanks for your tym may the lord bless the rest of your day
29/1/24, 10:48 AM - +263 77 758 4433: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 10:49 AM - +263 77 758 4433: The ammended recommendation letter
29/1/24, 10:51 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Nokutenda. I hope you are all doing well today. Thank you for sharing the recommendation letter with me, I have duly taken a note of it.
29/1/24, 10:51 AM - +263 77 405 9607: Gud morning to you
29/1/24, 10:53 AM - +263 77 758 4433: Morning how ur you today
29/1/24, 10:56 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am doing well. How has your day been doing so far?
29/1/24, 10:59 AM - +263 77 405 9607: Not bad thanks fo asking
29/1/24, 11:00 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: During our previous discussion, we were talking about the Financial Secure Plan. Continuing from where we left off, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
29/1/24, 11:03 AM - +263 77 758 4433: Yes please fo ahead
29/1/24, 11:08 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay before your due date.
29/1/24, 11:08 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
29/1/24, 11:08 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
29/1/24, 11:18 AM - +263 77 405 9607: Clear
29/1/24, 11:23 AM - +263 77 405 9607: So it's means we are gng into our straight saving starting on the 18 of February right
29/1/24, 11:25 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: You may start thplan in the month of January itself. If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
29/1/24, 11:25 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
29/1/24, 11:25 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
29/1/24, 11:25 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
29/1/24, 11:27 AM - +263 77 758 4433: It's quite a reasonable procedure which needs commitment
29/1/24, 11:32 AM - +263 77 405 9607: So wat is the due date for this first payment
29/1/24, 11:34 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: You can decide one date on which you will make the monthly payment every month. We will discuss the same in detail during our conversation, allow me to share all the relevant information related to the Financial Secure Plan for your reference.
29/1/24, 11:34 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
29/1/24, 11:37 AM - +263 77 758 4433: We are following
29/1/24, 11:50 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
29/1/24, 11:50 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
29/1/24, 11:50 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
29/1/24, 11:52 AM - +263 77 405 9607: I dnt kno if it's possible mam to start our payment on 11th on February and will stick to this particular date coz we hv some other comments this month end. eg. Fees , rentals etc so maybe 11 will be fexible for us
29/1/24, 11:53 AM - +263 77 758 4433: I think the 11th of every month will be oky starting this February
29/1/24, 11:55 AM - +263 77 758 4433: This saves a lot of hassles and definitely leaves us with no pressure
29/1/24, 11:57 AM - +263 77 405 9607: Yaa
29/1/24, 12:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you wish to begin the payment plan on 11th of February and want to set the 11th of every month as the deposit date, that is completely acceptable. Thank you for letting me know of the same.
29/1/24, 12:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know if you were also able to go through my previous messages?
29/1/24, 12:06 PM - +263 77 405 9607: You are welcome
29/1/24, 12:11 PM - +263 77 405 9607: Yes mam
29/1/24, 12:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
29/1/24, 12:22 PM - +263 77 758 4433: So this $900  from the 16th to 20th will be for fees for the same year/semester  or it's just fees which can be paid whenever convenient
29/1/24, 12:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It will be used for the same year itself. May I know if that is clear?
29/1/24, 12:29 PM - +263 77 758 4433: Oky understood
29/1/24, 12:31 PM - +263 77 758 4433: Sorry to bring you back a bit.The FBC account is  in whose name ,student or parent
29/1/24, 1:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is advisable to open the account under the student's name.
29/1/24, 1:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most people can discuss it the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly. <This message was edited>
29/1/24, 1:42 PM - +263 77 405 9607: I think tomorrow since we are all at wk right nw so I thinks we will discuss this tonight so that we can reconnect again tomorrow
29/1/24, 1:52 PM - +263 77 758 4433: Tomorrow is oky
29/1/24, 2:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you tomorrow to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.

However, I am glad that we can reconnect today and move forward with our discussions. Before we proceed, I would like to check in on you and your family. How are you all doing today?
31/1/24, 10:24 AM - +263 77 758 4433: We are all doing well. What about you
31/1/24, 10:26 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am fine too, thank you for asking.  Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held last week, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
31/1/24, 10:26 AM - +263 77 405 9607: Doing fine thanks hw a you dng
31/1/24, 10:30 AM - +263 77 758 4433: We do not know about it share more about it
31/1/24, 10:47 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
31/1/24, 10:47 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
31/1/24, 10:47 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
31/1/24, 10:48 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me share a glimpse of the conference with you and your family. I am certain that Nokutenda too would be this excited to attend such events when he comes to India.

This was indeed a momentous step for all of our students, making them employable ready and giving them access to the right opportunities for their careers ahead.

31/1/24, 11:03 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly. Also, regarding the discussion we had the other day about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
31/1/24, 11:23 AM - +263 77 405 9607: Yaa we did discuss it at length  it's  a very easy and affordable way of prepairing our daughter for a higher education it leaves us with no financial stress we welcomed the idea and willing to start our savings as promised

Since you have been one of the most dedicated students, and I see you have great aspirations, I wanted you to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.
31/1/24, 11:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of February, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
31/1/24, 11:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
31/1/24, 11:44 AM - +263 77 405 9607: Yaa sure we need to change our date for our payments we had suggested 11 bt we want to change it to 16 of February if possible mam after we had that discussion as a family we hd decided to shift the date if possible so that everything will go smoothly sorry fo that mam
