27/1/24, 4:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Blessing 2K24JAN1895)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
27/1/24, 4:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Blessing EWYL23E1232)* . In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
27/1/24, 4:39 PM - +263 71 975 2736: Yes mam l am quite clear about all group’s purpose .
27/1/24, 5:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counsellor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counselling session with your counsellor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
27/1/24, 5:20 PM - +263 71 975 2736: The EWYL program impressed me the most . Having the opportunity to be self financed playing a pivotal role in equipping a student to get a first hand professional experience .
27/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your feedback. I am glad to know that you find the program to be so helpful in terms of self-financing. As much as I would like to continue with our conversation today, my operational hours have already concluded and I have had a long day already. Could you kindly suggest a suitable time for you on Monday when we can connect to further discuss your application process?
27/1/24, 5:39 PM - +263 71 975 2736: I will be available starting from 1 o’clock mam .

29/1/24, 12:45 PM - +263 71 975 2736: Good afternoon team .
29/1/24, 1:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Blessing. I hope you are all doing well. How has your day been going so far?
29/1/24, 1:17 PM - +263 71 975 2736: It’s a picture perfect of a day .
29/1/24, 1:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
29/1/24, 1:42 PM - +263 71 975 2736: Yes let’s start .
29/1/24, 2:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 2:10 PM - +263 71 975 2736: I am done with it .
29/1/24, 2:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
29/1/24, 2:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
29/1/24, 2:46 PM - +263 71 975 2736: They are very clear and well understood .
29/1/24, 2:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps - 

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
29/1/24, 2:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
29/1/24, 3:01 PM - +263 71 975 2736: Yes l am following this very well .
29/1/24, 3:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
29/1/24, 3:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
29/1/24, 3:54 PM - +263 71 975 2736: They are very clear too .
29/1/24, 4:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
29/1/24, 4:26 PM - +263 71 975 2736: Yes .
29/1/24, 4:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
29/1/24, 4:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
29/1/24, 4:43 PM - +263 71 975 2736: Yes .
29/1/24, 5:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 5:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled for tomorrow after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?

30/1/24, 3:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Could you kindly share your understanding of each video individually?
30/1/24, 3:27 PM - +263 71 975 2736: I will summarize that in this video the cofounders of EDOOFA keeps a whole of fame record of successful Edoofians. The most important transition is when a student is handed the scholarship credit form . Students should be open minded and therefore must also follow EDOOFA’S instructions .
30/1/24, 3:42 PM - +263 71 975 2736: The second video was emphasizing on the importance of the Statement of purpose which is designed to market you for a good first impression. EDOOFA contacts the schools , colleges and universities on my behalf which are on their platform . The SOP convinces the admission board that the student is worth the scholarship.

1/2/24, 11:17 AM - +263 71 975 2736: Answering question 4 : 
Electrical devices convert electrical energy into other forms of energy , for example heat , light or sound . Electronic devices control the flow of electrons in order to perform a task . The term electrical deals with the flow of electrical power or charge , whereas electronics deals with the flow of electrons . There is only a minute difference between electrical and electronics, and both of them more or less deal with electricity. They is also the difference of circuits which can not be ignored . Electric circuit simply powers machines with electricity. However , an electronic circuit can interpret a signal or an instruction and perform a task to suit the circumstances. For example a microwave oven often beeps when it has finished cooking, to inform the user that his or her meal is ready . Electronic and Electrical systems have also differences in maintenance . While electrical engineering is all about generation , transmission, and distribution of power , electronics engineering focuses on the design , development, and maintenance of electronic circuitry used in different types of equipment used in TV , radio , computes e.t.c. .
1/2/24, 11:30 AM - +263 71 975 2736: Answering question 5: 
Unlike the battery , a capacitor is a circuit component that temporarily stores electrical energy through distributing charged particles on ( generally two) plates to create a potential difference. A capacitor can take a shorter time than a battery to charge up and it can release all the energy very quickly. A capacitor works on the principle that the capacitance of a conductor increases appreciably when an earthed conductor is brought near it . Hence , a capacitor has two plates separated by a distance having equal and opposite charges . The purpose of the capacitor are widely used in electronic circuits for blocking direct current while allowing alternating current to pass . In analog filter networks , they smooth the output of power supplies . In resonant circuits they tune radio to particular frequencies. A circuit can work without a capacitor, it depends on what type of circuit you are talking about . If it is an output from a full wave rectifier , and capacitor is not used , you will have a lot of ripples ( voltage fluctuation) . If it is a resonate circuit,  you can’t say that it is resonate if you remove the capacitor.
1/2/24, 11:32 AM - +263 71 975 2736: NB : mam can you confirm if my statement of purpose reflected there . I sent it early morning today .

2/2/24, 3:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that Blessing. I wish you all the best for your EWYL journey!
2/2/24, 3:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With the completion of the SOP form, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey, i.e. *Introduction to Financial Secure Plan*.
2/2/24, 3:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Cardiovascular Technology) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
2/2/24, 3:42 PM - +263 71 975 2736: Bachelors Degree in Electrical Engineering , and yes am planning to arrive in August 2025 .
2/2/24, 3:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the confusion. You are planning on pursuing B.Tech (Electronics and Electrical Engineering) and you plan on arriving in India in August 2025. Thank you for confirming that for me. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
2/2/24, 3:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
2/2/24, 3:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
2/2/24, 3:46 PM - +263 71 975 2736: Yes mam , can you explain more to me .
2/2/24, 4:18 PM - +263 71 975 2736: When is it beginning mam .
2/2/24, 5:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the confusion Blessing. Allow me to share the information with you.
2/2/24, 5:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As promised, now that you are a part of the Edoofa Journey, the opportunity to help you self-fund your higher education and for you to be industry-ready s here, and in light of the same, I would like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Friday (2 February 2024).
