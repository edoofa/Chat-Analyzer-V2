This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
25/1/24, 12:31 PM - +263 78 746 3056: Yes understood its clear
25/1/24, 12:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counsellor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.
25/1/24, 12:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counselling session with your counsellor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?

25/1/24, 12:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you find the program to be so helpful. Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
25/1/24, 12:47 PM - +263 78 746 3056: Yes we can start, lam ready
25/1/24, 12:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 12:57 PM - +263 78 746 3056: Iam done, you now can explain in detail
25/1/24, 12:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
25/1/24, 12:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
25/1/24, 1:00 PM - +263 78 746 3056: Very much clear
25/1/24, 1:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps - 

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
25/1/24, 1:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
25/1/24, 1:03 PM - +263 78 746 3056: Yes lam following
25/1/24, 1:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
25/1/24, 1:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
25/1/24, 1:09 PM - +263 78 746 3056: Very clear but may l know on step 5.is this stage done next year
25/1/24, 1:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The stage will commence this year itself i.e., 2024 in the month of August.
25/1/24, 1:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I hope this helps?
25/1/24, 1:17 PM - +263 78 746 3056: Ok understood it's helpful
25/1/24, 1:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
25/1/24, 1:18 PM - +263 78 746 3056: We may start
25/1/24, 1:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
25/1/24, 1:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.

27/1/24, 12:23 PM - +263 78 746 3056: afternoon sir . we are doing great and you  there
27/1/24, 12:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are doing great. I am doing fine myself, thank you for asking.
27/1/24, 12:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the screenshot of the SOP form. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey, i.e. *Introduction to Financial Secure Plan*.
27/1/24, 12:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, before we start the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 22 February 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
27/1/24, 12:58 PM - +263 78 746 3056: you are welcome
27/1/24, 1:01 PM - +263 78 746 3056: yes we have managed to align them in the right direction
27/1/24, 1:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.

In the meantime. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Plan and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
27/1/24, 1:13 PM - +263 78 746 3056: ok sir   .  that exactly it is sir the information is correct
27/1/24, 1:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
27/1/24, 1:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
27/1/24, 1:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
27/1/24, 1:17 PM - +263 78 746 3056: iam aware of this and it is true
27/1/24, 1:18 PM - +263 78 746 3056: l am eager to know about the details of the plan and how it helps
27/1/24, 1:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
27/1/24, 1:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
27/1/24, 1:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
27/1/24, 1:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
27/1/24, 1:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
27/1/24, 1:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
27/1/24, 1:29 PM - +263 78 746 3056: it is what we wish to have , this plan in indeed helpful
27/1/24, 2:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
27/1/24, 2:03 PM - +263 78 746 3056: YES
27/1/24, 2:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
27/1/24, 2:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
27/1/24, 2:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
27/1/24, 2:11 PM - +263 78 746 3056: Yes l agree with this
27/1/24, 2:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
27/1/24, 2:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
27/1/24, 2:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
27/1/24, 2:22 PM - +263 78 746 3056: Yes l can see this perspective, it is very helpful l must say
27/1/24, 2:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
27/1/24, 2:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
27/1/24, 2:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
27/1/24, 2:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
27/1/24, 3:02 PM - +263 78 746 3056: Yes this will surely do
27/1/24, 3:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
27/1/24, 3:44 PM - +263 78 746 3056: yes I would like to know
27/1/24, 3:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay before your due date. <This message was edited>
27/1/24, 4:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
27/1/24, 4:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
27/1/24, 4:04 PM - +263 78 746 3056: Yes
27/1/24, 4:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
27/1/24, 4:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
27/1/24, 4:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
27/1/24, 4:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
27/1/24, 4:35 PM - +263 78 746 3056: this  is good , l must say
27/1/24, 5:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
27/1/24, 5:26 PM - +263 78 746 3056: Yes
27/1/24, 5:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. As much as I would like to continue with our discussion, my operational hours have concluded and I have already had a long day. Could you kindly suggest a suitable timing for you on Monday when we can continue our discussion about the same?
27/1/24, 5:40 PM - +263 78 746 3056: 1:30pm
27/1/24, 5:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. In such a case, we will conclude our conversation for today and reconnect on Monday at 1:30 PM for further discussion about your application profile. Until then, please take care and kindly extend my regards to your family as well.
27/1/24, 6:04 PM - +263 78 746 3056: Thank you. Take care also
29/1/24, 1:41 PM - +263 78 746 3056: Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is Mrs Aditi  and she has scheduled my session for 2 February
29/1/24, 2:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Thomas. I hope you are all doing well. Thank you for sharing the message, Thomas. How has your day been going so far?
29/1/24, 2:09 PM - +263 78 746 3056: Good afternoon. My day is good and thank you for asking
29/1/24, 2:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Continuing our previous conversation, in the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
29/1/24, 2:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
29/1/24, 2:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
29/1/24, 2:15 PM - +263 78 746 3056: Sounds good
29/1/24, 2:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
29/1/24, 2:50 PM - +263 78 746 3056: Yes l have understood
29/1/24, 3:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
29/1/24, 3:36 PM - +263 78 746 3056: Ok l think l will be able to discuss this today with both my parents
29/1/24, 3:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you tomorrow to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
30/1/24, 2:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Thomas

Please, how are you doing today? With regards to our discussion yesterday, I wanted to reach out and enquire if you are available for us to have a brief conversation?
30/1/24, 2:34 PM - +263 78 746 3056: Good afternoon.we are going good and you. We are available so we can have the conversation
30/1/24, 2:40 PM - +263 78 746 3056: Doing *
30/1/24, 3:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are doing well and are available for us to connect with each other. Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held last week, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
30/1/24, 3:34 PM - +263 78 746 3056: Iam not familiar with that
30/1/24, 3:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
30/1/24, 3:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
30/1/24, 3:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
30/1/24, 3:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me share a glimpse of the conference with you and your family. I am certain that you too would be this excited to attend such events when he comes to India.
30/1/24, 3:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 3:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

30/1/24, 3:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 3:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me know once you are able to go through the messages about the SLICE CON, along with the images and videos shared with you. This was indeed a momentous step for all of our students, making them employable ready and giving them access to the right opportunities for their careers ahead.
30/1/24, 3:56 PM - +263 78 746 3056: I have gone through them. This was indeed a great conference l must say
30/1/24, 3:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly, Thomas. Also, regarding the discussion we had the other day about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
30/1/24, 4:01 PM - +263 78 746 3056: Ok so we did have a discussion and during this discussion my father  liked the idea and recommended it. He had a few questions but l was able to answer him
30/1/24, 4:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, Parents and Thomas. For the current round of students, there are only 27 seats available for the students who can benefit from the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. 

Since you have been one of the most dedicated students, and I see you have great aspirations, I wanted you to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.
30/1/24, 4:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of January, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
30/1/24, 4:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
30/1/24, 4:36 PM - +263 78 746 3056: Ok  we will decide and tell you when father comes home from work
30/1/24, 5:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In such a case, we will reconnect tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the same. I hope that by then you will be able to discuss the same with your father and let me know about the date you have decided. Until then, please take care and have a blessed day ahead!
31/1/24, 11:10 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Thomas. I hope you are having a lovely morning. How are you all doing today?
31/1/24, 11:32 AM - +263 78 746 3056: Good morning, we are doing well and you
31/1/24, 11:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is wonderful to know that you are all doing well. I am fine too, thank you for asking. May I know if you were able to discuss the plan with your father, Thomas?
31/1/24, 11:58 AM - +263 78 746 3056: Yes we did discuss about the plan
31/1/24, 12:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. May I know if you have decided on a monthly deposit date?
31/1/24, 12:22 PM - +263 78 746 3056: Ok so we agreed that will be paying it on the 20th of every month, but we will  start in March  since this February we have to finish the remaining enrollment fee and l don't know if that is okay with you
31/1/24, 1:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing these details, your commitment to securing a seat in this exclusive program is appreciated.

This agreement is a crucial document that outlines the terms and conditions of your participation in the program.
