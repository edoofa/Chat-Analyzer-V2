I am glad to know that are enthusiastic to move forward with your admission process. and I hope you are excited for the new day and most importantly the new year as well. @263787255242 , the new year brings about a transformative mindset in us which may not emphasize immediate changes but a change in the direction that you believe is needed.

If I talk about myself, I have made a resolution to bring more humility in myself and bring about a change in my perspective to be a better version of myself all while ensuring that I help all of our students to achieve their educational goals. With that said, I would like to know what aspirations or a change in your approach towards life you wish to achieve?
12/1/24, 11:35 AM - +263 78 725 5242: I appreciate your thoughtful message and wish you the best with your own goals of humility and positive change in your life. 

As for myself,"I'm hoping to make some changes in my life, and I'd like to share them with you. I'm aiming to be more patient, positive, and humble in my interactions with others. I also want to take more time to listen and understand others, instead of rushing to respond or judge.I'm hoping to make some changes in my life, One of my goals is to be more mindful in my daily life. I'm hoping to focus on the present moment, rather than worrying about the past or future. I also want to practice gratitude more often and appreciate the small things in life. To achieve my goals, I've found it helpful to break them down into smaller, more manageable tasks. This way, I can focus on one task at a time and feel a sense of accomplishment when I complete it. I also try to stay positive and remind myself that progress, not perfection, is the goal. I know I'm not going to be perfect, but I'm trying my best to make progress each day.
12/1/24, 3:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that you want to become a better version of yourself by working on your inner self to be able to make better decisions in your life .

29/1/24, 5:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held last week, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
29/1/24, 5:47 PM - +263 78 725 5242: I'm not familiar with it,I'm eager to know it
29/1/24, 5:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'

However, I am glad that we can reconnect today and move forward with our discussion. Before we do so, I wanted to ask how your day has been going so far? <This message was edited>
30/1/24, 11:25 AM - +263 78 725 5242: Good morning. My day has been going well so far, and I'm glad to be able to chat with you again.
30/1/24, 11:56 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that your day has been going well. During our previous conversation, I had shared with you a few glimpses of the SLICE Con'24. Also, regarding the discussion we had the other day about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
30/1/24, 12:37 PM - +263 78 725 5242: I talked to my parents and they don't have a problem with it
30/1/24, 12:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, Parents and Lindsay. For the current round of students, there are only 27 seats available for the students who can benefit from the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. 

Since you have been one of the most dedicated students, and I see you have great aspirations, I wanted you to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.
30/1/24, 12:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of January, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
30/1/24, 12:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
30/1/24, 1:04 PM - +263 78 725 5242: Will pay by end of February
30/1/24, 1:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better. 

In the meantime, Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA (Travel and Tourism) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
30/1/24, 2:17 PM - +263 78 725 5242: Yes, that's correct - I'm planning to arrive in India in August 2025 to begin my studies. The program I've selected is the BA (Hons) Travel and Tourism Management, and I'm really excited about the opportunity to learn more about this field.
30/1/24, 2:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
30/1/24, 2:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
30/1/24, 2:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
31/1/24, 10:57 AM - +263 78 725 5242: Yes, I am very interested in learning more about the details. Can you give me an overview of how it works?
31/1/24, 11:02 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Lindsay. I hope you are all doing well today.

Continuing our previous discussion, Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
31/1/24, 11:02 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
31/1/24, 11:02 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
31/1/24, 11:02 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
31/1/24, 11:03 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
31/1/24, 11:03 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
31/1/24, 11:10 AM - +263 78 725 5242: I think you've made a very convincing case for the value of the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. The benefits you've described, such as a lower overall cost of education, access to scholarships, and greater financial stability, sound very attractive. And yes, I think my family would certainly benefit from this type of plan.
31/1/24, 11:12 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
31/1/24, 11:14 AM - +263 78 725 5242: Absolutely! I'd love to learn more about how this plan works in practice.
31/1/24, 11:29 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
31/1/24, 11:29 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
31/1/24, 11:29 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
1/2/24, 11:04 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Lindsay. I hope you are all doing great today!

I was hoping to get a response from your end yesterday, but it seems like due to some reason we were unable to connect. However, I am glad that we can reconnect today. How are you all doing this fine morning?
1/2/24, 12:48 PM - +263 78 725 5242: Im good and you ma'am
1/2/24, 2:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am fine too, thank you for asking. May I know if you were able to follow through with the details we discussed yesterday?
1/2/24, 4:33 PM - +263 78 725 5242: Yes ma'am l was able to follow them
2/2/24, 11:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Lindsay.

I hope that you are having a wonderful morning. Kindly excuse me for not being able to respond to your last message as our operational hours has already concluded. Before we move ahead with our discussion, I would like to ask you how you are doing today?
2/2/24, 11:49 AM - +263 78 725 5242: I'm good how are you ma'am
2/2/24, 12:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am fine too, thank you for asking. Moving forward in today's discussion, we will continue our discussion regarding the Financial Secure Plan.
2/2/24, 12:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
2/2/24, 12:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
2/2/24, 12:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
2/2/24, 4:03 PM - +263 78 725 5242: Yes l do see this one
2/2/24, 4:04 PM - +263 78 725 5242: Sorry ma'am for late replies it's just that l have been busy with school stuff
2/2/24, 4:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand Lindsay, it's quite alright.
2/2/24, 4:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.

If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
2/2/24, 4:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
2/2/24, 4:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
2/2/24, 5:55 PM - +263 78 725 5242: Absolutely, you're right.
2/2/24, 7:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to hear. Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. I would like to explain how this has been achieved during our next session.
2/2/24, 7:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: On this note, let us conclude our conversation for today and we will reconnect tomorrow for our next session. 

I wish you a blessed night!
2/2/24, 7:46 PM - +263 78 725 5242: Good night to you too ma'am
