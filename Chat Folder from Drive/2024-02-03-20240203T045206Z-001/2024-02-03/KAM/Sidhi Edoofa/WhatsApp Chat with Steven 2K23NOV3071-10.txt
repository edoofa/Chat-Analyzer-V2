29/12/23, 6:33 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
29/12/23, 6:34 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
29/12/23, 6:34 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identifying reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
29/12/23, 6:34 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
29/12/23, 6:34 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
29/12/23, 6:41 PM - +263 78 327 6052: Yes i agree with the above and i understood much better
29/12/23, 7:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
29/12/23, 7:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by 2nd Jan 6:30 PM.
29/12/23, 7:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

27/1/24, 2:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for introducing yourself Steven. I am glad to know that you are also interested in music and it is amazing to know that you are a picture editor too. I was going through your application profile and it is my understanding that you have successfully completed the 2nd step of the admission cycle i.e., Statement of Purpose. May I know if I am correct?
27/1/24, 3:43 PM - +263 78 327 6052: Yess
27/1/24, 3:43 PM - +263 78 327 6052: Yes you are correct
27/1/24, 4:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. I understand that you have school during the weekdays and your parents are occupied with work. In such a case, I want to ensure that our sessions are held in a timely and smooth manner so we can comfortably proceed with your application process. Could you kindly suggest a 1-hour slot between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM when we can have our sessions?

29/1/24, 4:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Steven. I hope you are all doing well today. How has your day been going so far?
29/1/24, 4:16 PM - +263 78 327 6052: My day is wonderful. How are you today
29/1/24, 4:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am doing fine too, thank you for asking. Moving forward with our discussion today, to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA (Travel and Tourism) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
29/1/24, 5:05 PM - +263 78 327 6052: The information is very correct
29/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
29/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
29/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
29/1/24, 5:35 PM - +263 78 327 6052: Yes may you help on that
29/1/24, 5:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As much as I would like to continue with our discussion, since my operational hours for the day have already concluded, I would like to reconnect with you tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the Financial Secure Plan and admission process. Until then, please take care and have a blessed day ahead!
29/1/24, 5:53 PM - +263 78 327 6052: Thank you so mach
30/1/24, 4:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Steven.

I hope everything is well on your end. Before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to check in on you and your family. How are you all doing today?
30/1/24, 9:04 PM - +263 78 327 6052: Sory for being absent for the session i was overwhelmed by school work but i promise i will be active on tomorrow's session onwards.
31/1/24, 4:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Steven. I hope you are having a wonderful day. How are you all doing today?
31/1/24, 4:30 PM - +263 78 327 6052: We are doing great, and you ther?
31/1/24, 5:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am fine too, thank you for asking. In our previous conversation, we had just started discussing the Financial Secure Plan. Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
31/1/24, 5:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
31/1/24, 5:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
31/1/24, 5:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
31/1/24, 5:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
31/1/24, 5:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
31/1/24, 8:21 PM - +263 78 327 6052: Yes we wish for this
1/2/24, 10:20 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Simbrashe. I hope you are all doing wonderful today!

Kindly excuse me for being unable to respond to your message last night, as our operational hours had already concluded. Allow me to help you understand the Financial Secure Plan in a better way. As you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025. <This message was edited>

1/2/24, 10:21 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
1/2/24, 10:21 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
1/2/24, 10:38 AM - +263 78 327 6052: Sory im not Simbrashe
1/2/24, 11:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I apologize for the confusion from my end Steven. As I am currently actively conversing with a lot of students, I happened to mistype. 

May I know if you were able to go through my previous messages Steven?
1/2/24, 12:09 PM - +263 78 327 6052: Yes i agree
1/2/24, 2:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
1/2/24, 2:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
1/2/24, 2:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
1/2/24, 4:57 PM - +263 78 327 6052: Yes i am so i will be paying half fee right
2/2/24, 4:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Steven.

I hope you are having a wonderful day. Kindly excuse me for not being able to respond to your message last night as our team is currently working tirelessly towards the preparation of our upcoming Zimbabwe trip in the month of February.
2/2/24, 4:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is indeed correct. You will be saving up for your 1st semester of your higher education.
2/2/24, 4:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Allow me to proceed with our discussion yesterday. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
2/2/24, 4:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
2/2/24, 4:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
2/2/24, 4:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
2/2/24, 4:51 PM - +263 78 327 6052: Nice i understood
2/2/24, 4:52 PM - +263 78 327 6052: No problem
2/2/24, 4:53 PM - +263 78 327 6052: Yes i do know
2/2/24, 4:54 PM - +263 78 327 6052: Absolutely correct
2/2/24, 5:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to hear. Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
2/2/24, 5:37 PM - +263 78 327 6052: Yes i li
2/2/24, 5:45 PM - +263 78 327 6052: I like
2/2/24, 8:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to see that you like the approach. As much as I would like to continue with our conversation today, my operational hours have already concluded and I have had a long day already. Let us conclude our conversation for today, and we will reconnect tomorrow to further discuss the Financial Secure Plan.

I wish you a blessed night!
