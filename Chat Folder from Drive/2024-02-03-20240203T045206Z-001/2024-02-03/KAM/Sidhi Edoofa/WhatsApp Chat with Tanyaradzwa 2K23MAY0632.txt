16/1/24, 12:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tanyaradzwa,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects with flying colours! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
23/1/24, 1:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly allow us some time to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, we will reconnect with you to discuss the next steps in your academic journey.
23/1/24, 4:50 PM - +263 78 705 3454: Ok thank you
23/1/24, 4:50 PM - +263 78 705 3454: But l have another issue
2/2/24, 6:29 AM - +263 78 705 3454: Morning
2/2/24, 10:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tanyaradzwa.

I hope you are having a wonderful morning. How may I help you today?
2/2/24, 10:46 AM - +263 78 705 3454: I had any issue
I need to change the program that l have choose at first
2/2/24, 1:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that Tanyaradzwa. May I know what course do you want to change to and why did this shift in your decision happen?
2/2/24, 1:27 PM - +263 78 705 3454: I need to shift from Chemical engineering to medicine because l later realized that in my home country the job opportunities for engineering are very slim
2/2/24, 1:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Since you are aiming to pursue your higher education abroad, may I know if you intend to return to your country for employment? Once you graduate with a degree from India, it will be globally acceptable and you will find job opportunities across the world, even in developed countries like USA and UK.
2/2/24, 1:40 PM - +263 78 705 3454: Not as soon as I finish bt letter on l would like to return to my home country
2/2/24, 2:13 PM - +263 78 705 3454: In addition
When l was doing my counseling session l was told that if you do chemical engineering you gonna work as a pharmacist bt when l carried out research when l had no pressure with school,l found out that it's impossible to specialize on pharmacy if you're a chemical engineer
2/2/24, 3:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. I was having a conversation with your counsellor, Mr. Shubham, and he gave me a few insights about your conversation. He mentioned that you have an inclination towards creating medicine and that is why you voluntarily chose to pursue Chemical Engineering. May I know if the information that I have is correct?
2/2/24, 7:05 PM - +263 78 705 3454: Unfortunately I no longer have my chats l would have showed you
2/2/24, 7:05 PM - +263 78 705 3454: We didn't discuss about doing medicine
2/2/24, 8:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand, Tanyaradzwa. Let us reconnect tomorrow during the day to discuss your concern regarding the course change.

I wish you a blessed night!
2/2/24, 8:53 PM - +263 78 705 3454: Ok thank you ma'am
