19/12/23, 10:22 AM - You joined using this group's invite link
21/12/23, 6:35 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Adonis !

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. May I know if you are currently available so that we can proceed with the session for your admission process?
21/12/23, 6:36 PM - +263 71 480 1825: Good evening to you too , yes we are
21/12/23, 7:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know I know if you were able to go through the above points?
21/12/23, 7:11 PM - +263 77 168 2406: Yes we did go through
21/12/23, 7:23 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
21/12/23, 7:24 PM - +263 77 168 2406: Yes can you explain further
21/12/23, 8:04 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in December 2023, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
21/12/23, 8:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
21/12/23, 8:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
21/12/23, 8:10 PM - +263 77 168 2406: Okay I agree
21/12/23, 8:13 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
21/12/23, 8:13 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
21/12/23, 8:13 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
21/12/23, 8:15 PM - +263 71 480 1825: Yah I can see it now makes sense now
21/12/23, 8:19 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
21/12/23, 8:19 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
21/12/23, 8:19 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
21/12/23, 8:20 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
21/12/23, 8:20 PM - +263 77 168 2406: I see
21/12/23, 8:22 PM - +263 77 168 2406: For this we already transact in US dollars so we already have a nostro account
27/12/23, 7:44 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Adonis. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

It has been a while. I was not able to connect with you yesterday. May I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session for your admission process?
27/12/23, 7:44 PM - +263 77 168 2406: How are you
27/12/23, 7:44 PM - +263 77 168 2406: Yes we are available
27/12/23, 7:47 PM - +263 71 480 1825: We are all good 
Yes we are available
27/12/23, 8:01 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session for your admission process?
27/12/23, 8:01 PM - +263 71 480 1825: Yes we are
27/12/23, 8:17 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
27/12/23, 8:18 PM - +263 77 168 2406: Yes
27/12/23, 8:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
27/12/23, 8:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
27/12/23, 8:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
27/12/23, 8:29 PM - +263 77 168 2406: Okay this is understandable and Okay
27/12/23, 8:33 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
27/12/23, 8:43 PM - +263 71 480 1825: Okay yeah understandable here
27/12/23, 8:44 PM - +263 77 168 2406: Yes
27/12/23, 8:44 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know by when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
27/12/23, 8:46 PM - +263 77 168 2406: We will discuss it by tomorrow and give you feedback
27/12/23, 8:57 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you on Thursday to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
28/12/23, 6:09 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are having a wonderful evening with your family as we are approaching a New Year. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session for the admission process?
28/12/23, 6:10 PM - +263 77 168 2406: Evening
28/12/23, 6:12 PM - +263 77 168 2406: We can proceed
28/12/23, 6:35 PM - +263 71 480 1825: Yes we can proceed
28/12/23, 7:53 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you were able to have a conversation with your family regarding the Edoofa secure plan with your family?
28/12/23, 8:01 PM - +263 77 168 2406: Yes we did and it's okay we can proceed
28/12/23, 8:24 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me. I shall be having a conversation with the accounts team and getting back to you very shortly to pass on the next update.
28/12/23, 8:24 PM - +263 71 480 1825: Oky
28/12/23, 8:33 PM - +263 77 168 2406: Ol
28/12/23, 8:33 PM - +263 77 168 2406: Ok
29/12/23, 9:33 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was not able to continue with the session today as I was on a call with the university officials. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing the session for today and let us connect on the 2nd of January. Along with that, as we stand on the threshold of a new year, I extend my heartfelt wishes to you and your family for a prosperous and fulfilling 2024. May this year bring new opportunities, fresh beginnings, and the realization of your dreams and aspirations.

I hope the coming year is filled with success, health, and happiness for you and your loved ones. May it be a year that surpasses all expectations and is replete with moments of joy and achievement.

Wishing you a Happy New Year⭐
29/12/23, 9:35 PM - +263 71 480 1825: Happy new year to you too

This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

9/1/24, 9:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
9/1/24, 9:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test. This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
9/1/24, 9:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?

I hope you are excited for the new day and most importantly the new year as well. The new year brings about a transformative mindset in us which may not emphasize immediate changes but a change in the direction that you believe is needed.

If I talk about myself, I have made a resolution to bring more humility in myself and bring about a change in my perspective to be a better version of myself all while ensuring that I help all of our students to achieve their educational goals.

We will be able to help you only if we can connect timely and have healthy discussions.
12/1/24, 8:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, this is something I want to inform you all that the agenda for the discussions, that we are going to have, is to help you all understand the process you will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since you are going to be occupied with school and your parents are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
12/1/24, 8:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January]. This way, we can align it with our availability as well and help you move forward and make progress in a streamlined manner. Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your input and find the right time for our sessions.

Our day has been going smoothly sofar
29/1/24, 1:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are all well and your day has been going well. I am doing fine too, thank you for asking. Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held last week, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
29/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 77 168 2406: You can elaborate on that one as it's our first time to hear about it
29/1/24, 2:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
29/1/24, 2:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
29/1/24, 2:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
29/1/24, 2:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me share a glimpse of the conference with you and your family. I am certain that Adonis too would be this excited to attend such events when he comes to India.
29/1/24, 2:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 2:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

29/1/24, 2:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 2:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me know once you are able to go through the messages about the SLICE CON, along with the images and videos shared with you. This was indeed a momentous step for all of our students, making them employable ready and giving them access to the right opportunities for their careers ahead.
29/1/24, 2:34 PM - +263 71 480 1825: Definitely it would be huge honour to seat at the same table with such people
29/1/24, 2:36 PM - +263 71 480 1825: Oky I am done abd I'm quite pleased seeing that this people are very proud Edoofians
29/1/24, 2:47 PM - +263 77 168 2406: Okay
29/1/24, 3:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly, Adonis. Also, regarding the discussion we had the other day about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
29/1/24, 3:01 PM - +263 71 480 1825: Yes we discussed it, my only querie was , is the money for the secure plan being deposited into my savings account or into the Edoofa account? <This message was edited>
29/1/24, 3:01 PM - +263 77 168 2406: We wanted clarification on that issue
29/1/24, 3:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Under Edoofa's Financial Secure Plan, you are required to deposit the amount with Edoofa. I hope that helps with your query?
29/1/24, 3:39 PM - +263 77 168 2406: Okay noted. So how does the process go
29/1/24, 4:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500.
29/1/24, 4:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
29/1/24, 4:02 PM - +263 77 168 2406: Okay noted
29/1/24, 4:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
29/1/24, 4:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
29/1/24, 4:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
29/1/24, 4:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
29/1/24, 4:34 PM - +263 77 168 2406: Okay we understand.
29/1/24, 5:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
29/1/24, 5:21 PM - +263 77 168 2406: Yes
29/1/24, 5:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As much as I would like to continue with our discussion, since my operational hours for the day have already concluded and I have had a long day, I would like to reconnect with you tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the Financial Secure Plan and admission process. Until then, please take care and have a blessed day ahead!
29/1/24, 5:40 PM - +263 77 168 2406: Same to you
29/1/24, 8:01 PM - +263 71 480 1825: Okay same to you
30/1/24, 1:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Adonis. I hope everything is well on your end. How are you all doing today?
30/1/24, 1:26 PM - +263 71 480 1825: We are fine how are you?
30/1/24, 1:27 PM - +263 77 168 2406: We are okay. How are you
30/1/24, 1:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am fine too, thank you for asking. Based on our previous conversation, we were discussing the plan for the remaining 10 months of the Financial Secure Plan. Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
30/1/24, 1:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
30/1/24, 1:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
30/1/24, 1:58 PM - +263 77 168 2406: Okay noted
30/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 77 168 2406: Okay noted
30/1/24, 2:04 PM - +263 77 168 2406: It's okay
30/1/24, 2:05 PM - +263 77 168 2406: Is any letter that you give us to aid us in account opening
30/1/24, 2:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Once the 10 months are completed, our team will guide you and give the relevant information required to open a bank account. May I know if this was helpful?
30/1/24, 2:24 PM - +263 77 168 2406: Okay understood
30/1/24, 2:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad that it was helpful. Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
30/1/24, 2:47 PM - +263 77 168 2406: Yes we understand
30/1/24, 3:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their family the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
30/1/24, 3:13 PM - +263 77 168 2406: We will discuss about it tomorrow then we will give you feedback  after the discussion
30/1/24, 3:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you tomorrow to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
30/1/24, 3:48 PM - +263 77 168 2406: Okay thanks. Have a blessed day as well
31/1/24, 1:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Adonis. I hope you are having a wonderful day. How are you all doing today?
31/1/24, 1:23 PM - +263 77 168 2406: We are all okay. How are you
31/1/24, 1:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am fine too, thank you for asking. Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held last week, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
31/1/24, 1:44 PM - +263 77 168 2406: It was previously mentioned and some pictures and videos were sent over the issue of SLICE CON
31/1/24, 1:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. That is wonderful to know. Also, regarding the discussion we had the other day about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
31/1/24, 1:56 PM - +263 77 168 2406: Yes we did
31/1/24, 2:03 PM - +263 77 168 2406: You can explain on how we go about it
31/1/24, 2:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I believe we have discussed the details of the Financial Secure Plan. May I know which aspect you wish to get more clarity on?
31/1/24, 2:34 PM - +263 77 168 2406: You said that we make deposits of 150 per month for 10 months. I want to know which account will the money be deposited into and starting when
31/1/24, 3:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For the current round of students, there are only 27 seats available for the students who can benefit from the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. 

Since you have been one of the most dedicated students, and I see you have great aspirations, I wanted you to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.
31/1/24, 3:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of February, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
31/1/24, 3:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
31/1/24, 3:06 PM - +263 77 168 2406: 28th of every month will do just fine
31/1/24, 3:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing these details, your commitment to securing a seat in this exclusive program is appreciated.
