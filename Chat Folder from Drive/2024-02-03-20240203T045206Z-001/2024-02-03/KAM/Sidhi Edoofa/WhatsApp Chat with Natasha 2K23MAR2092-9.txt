6/1/24, 4:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the same spirit, I would like to share that I am embarking on a journey as I prepare myself to pursue my doctorate and take a step forward in my academic pursuits. This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.

I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
8/1/24, 2:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
8/1/24, 2:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 2:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?

8/1/24, 5:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your kind wishes. I am happy to be here to support her in realising her dreams and succeed in life.
8/1/24, 5:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I would like to discuss about your daughter's admission process. As per her application file, it seems that she were unable to proceed with her admission formalities scheduled for August 2024. Since a few months have passed, and this is our first interaction, I would like to inquire why you were unable to do so and if now is the right time for you and her to focus on your university admission journey for higher education abroad.
8/1/24, 5:16 PM - +263 71 243 1513: She was focusing more on her examinations but it's done and let's proceed with the admission process whilst we are waiting for her results so that we meet our 2024 August enrollment.
9/1/24, 8:10 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is completely understandable. Working hard and concentrating on examinations is very important, and it is good to hear that she was focused on it to perform her best during examinations.

It is great to know that you are now available to take your admission process forward.

I would like to schedule a detailed conversation regarding the same today. Would you be available at 2:30 PM today?

10/1/24, 8:17 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
10/1/24, 8:17 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
10/1/24, 8:17 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/1/24, 8:21 AM - +263 71 243 1513: Great thank you
10/1/24, 8:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, indeed. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
10/1/24, 8:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.
10/1/24, 8:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
10/1/24, 8:48 AM - +263 71 243 1513: Great job you are doing assist our children to achieve their dreams. Well done.
10/1/24, 8:48 AM - +263 71 243 1513: Keep up the good work
10/1/24, 8:54 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
10/1/24, 8:54 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you, dear. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
10/1/24, 8:54 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
10/1/24, 8:54 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
10/1/24, 8:54 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
10/1/24, 8:59 AM - +263 71 243 1513: Reviewed let's proceed thank you
10/1/24, 9:00 AM - +263 71 243 1513: Good flexible developments
10/1/24, 9:01 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
10/1/24, 9:01 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
10/1/24, 9:01 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.
10/1/24, 9:01 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
10/1/24, 9:08 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know if you were able to go through the above messages?
10/1/24, 9:10 AM - +263 71 243 1513: Yes
10/1/24, 9:10 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad.
10/1/24, 9:10 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
10/1/24, 9:10 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
10/1/24, 9:10 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
10/1/24, 9:22 AM - +263 71 243 1513: That is great, keeping the  fees at the same level from last year and during the whole period upto completion of her bachelor's education. Well done by keeping the fees affordable and flexible.
10/1/24, 9:24 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes indeed, Natasha.
10/1/24, 9:24 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
10/1/24, 9:24 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
10/1/24, 9:27 AM - +263 71 243 1513: Yes very resonate , thank you.
10/1/24, 9:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
10/1/24, 9:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
10/1/24, 9:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $450 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
10/1/24, 9:35 AM - +263 71 243 1513: May l get deadline of end of February onwards because January l am not ready financially.
10/1/24, 9:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I have taken a note of your query, dear. However, once I have explained the benefits of the endowment program, which will help you financially, we can discuss your query in detail and find a solution for it. So, shall we move ahead?
10/1/24, 9:41 AM - +263 71 243 1513: Yes thank you
10/1/24, 9:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well, dear.
10/1/24, 9:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
10/1/24, 9:49 AM - +263 71 243 1513: So far before the A level are out the assessment is based on O level results and A level entry examination slip , when the results are out ,if you meet the pass standard. You will be enrolled at the university, if you don't  meet the required passes , you will be enrolled for a diploma then proceed later.
10/1/24, 9:50 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is very correct, Natasha. I am glad that you have such clarity.
10/1/24, 9:50 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
10/1/24, 9:51 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
10/1/24, 10:00 AM - +263 71 243 1513: Thank well explained.
10/1/24, 10:11 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
10/1/24, 10:13 AM - +263 78 648 1446: Noted it's fully understood
10/1/24, 10:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
10/1/24, 10:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
10/1/24, 10:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
10/1/24, 10:29 AM - +263 78 648 1446: Yes it's clear
10/1/24, 10:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
10/1/24, 10:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
10/1/24, 10:45 AM - +263 71 243 1513: This message was deleted
10/1/24, 11:21 AM - +263 71 243 1513: Clear thank you
10/1/24, 12:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
10/1/24, 1:12 PM - +263 71 243 1513: Clear thank you
10/1/24, 1:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
10/1/24, 1:41 PM - +263 71 243 1513: So far, it's clear. May we have a timetable for these sessions. Thank you.
10/1/24, 2:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
10/1/24, 2:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
10/1/24, 2:29 PM - +263 71 243 1513: Sorry who is Abigail?
10/1/24, 2:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I apologize for the confusion dear.
10/1/24, 2:34 PM - +263 71 243 1513: Ok
10/1/24, 2:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With this, we have come to a conclusion to our conversation. We have completed your process, and we will move forward with sending out your application to different universities and start your process so you can get the best education here in India. Are you excited for the same?
10/1/24, 2:38 PM - +263 78 648 1446: Yes i am  excited for the next step
10/1/24, 2:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
10/1/24, 5:20 PM - +263 71 243 1513: Is the medical fees going to be included?
11/1/24, 8:02 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good morning, dear. I hope your day is going well.

While the university provides various facilities, medical expenses are not covered under their purview. To protect international students from these expenses, there is *Medical Health Insurance*.

A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from India or Zimbabwe, it would cost them around $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?

I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
13/1/24, 10:15 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
13/1/24, 10:16 AM - +263 78 648 1446: Thank you we may continue
13/1/24, 10:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
13/1/24, 10:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is your annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
13/1/24, 10:27 AM - +263 78 648 1446: 1)$350

2)$0

3)$1600

4)$250

5)$1000
13/1/24, 10:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 90% scholarship on tuition fees. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
13/1/24, 10:54 AM - +263 78 648 1446: Yes, the 90%scholarship has reduced so much stress concerning tertiary education
13/1/24, 10:59 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to see that. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
13/1/24, 11:00 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1600 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1850.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1600. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
13/1/24, 11:04 AM - +263 78 648 1446: May i ask what is the Misc fee
13/1/24, 11:14 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Miscellaneous fees include components like maintenance fees, water and electricity charges.
13/1/24, 11:14 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
13/1/24, 11:15 AM - +263 71 243 1513: Thank you for your clarifying, food is it included on accomodation
13/1/24, 11:18 AM - +263 78 648 1446: Wow it's incredible
13/1/24, 11:21 AM - +263 71 243 1513: Earlier on , you said the admission processing fees is flexible, we can pay in installments . May you explain in our case.
13/1/24, 11:25 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As we move forward in our discussion today, the majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well.
13/1/24, 11:26 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make his/her education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
13/1/24, 11:28 AM - +263 71 243 1513: Yes let's continue
13/1/24, 11:30 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1850, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
13/1/24, 11:30 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
13/1/24, 11:33 AM - +263 71 243 1513: Clear , thank you for making education more affordable through the EWYL program.
13/1/24, 11:35 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
13/1/24, 11:36 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $1250. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1250 - $1000 = $250, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
13/1/24, 11:36 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
13/1/24, 11:37 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I would like to make a small correction here. Your annual fees is $1600. Which would mean, your balance for the year would be reduced to $1600 - $1000 = $600.
13/1/24, 11:37 AM - +263 78 648 1446: Yes i have already started the EWYL project my problem is that companies take along time to respond  back and it is quite frustrating . I have been  waiting for their responses since last year.
13/1/24, 11:37 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
13/1/24, 11:38 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I recommend reaching out to your EWYL mentor, and sharing the same concern with them as they will be able to guide you better with this issue.
13/1/24, 11:39 AM - +263 78 648 1446: Thank you i will get in touch with her
13/1/24, 11:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
13/1/24, 11:44 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1850 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $850 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
13/1/24, 11:46 AM - +263 78 648 1446: Yes it is clear
13/1/24, 11:47 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to see that your financial preparations are in place. I hope you recall that the per annum cost of education and the registration fee figures you mentioned were supposed to face a range of $2,000 to $3,000 for the annual cost of education and a registration fee between $500 and $1000.
13/1/24, 11:47 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, based on the discussions we had with your career counselor and their assessment of your application, they encouraged us to secure a higher quantum of scholarship for you. This is the reason the per annum cost of education is only $1600, which is significantly less than the general cost of education fee range ($2000 to $3000).
13/1/24, 11:48 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: When you look at this opportunity, with a higher quantum of scholarship, the registration fee may also appear a bit higher. Rest assured, this does not increase your financial burden, as it is an integral part of your first year of education cost and will be utilized for the same purpose. I hope this makes sense?
13/1/24, 11:52 AM - +263 78 648 1446: Yes it does make sense that through the scholarship program the financial burden decreases
13/1/24, 11:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In continuation of our discussion, I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for you is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that you will find a more affordable and high-quality education. 

Certainly, there are other universities that may assess your scholarship qualifications, and with those, the cost of education may fall within the specified range I mentioned earlier.
13/1/24, 11:58 AM - +263 78 648 1446: Noted
13/1/24, 11:58 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $850 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?
13/1/24, 11:58 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: It's essential to consider the big picture and the overall financial benefits that come with the scholarship offer you have received. Do you not agree with this?
13/1/24, 12:05 PM - +263 78 648 1446: For question you posed i would go for the first option because the scholarship is meant to reduce financial burden and registration fee is only for the  first year
13/1/24, 12:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Glad to see we share the same perspective. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1,850. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you  arrive in India will be $1850 - $1,000 = $850 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
13/1/24, 12:23 PM - +263 78 648 1446: Yes i am
13/1/24, 12:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as January 26th, 2024*.
13/1/24, 12:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
13/1/24, 12:35 PM - +263 78 648 1446: Yes that will be great
13/1/24, 12:38 PM - +263 71 243 1513: I recall that will get a grant of $100 and remain with $900 to pay in installments of $ 450 end of this month another $450 end of February.
13/1/24, 12:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $900 of the registration fee. This $900 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $450 before the first deadline date of *26 January, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $450 before the second deadline date of *26 February, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
13/1/24, 12:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $900 within 15 working days, before 26 January, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
13/1/24, 12:44 PM - +263 78 648 1446: Thank you  so much for clarifying and thank you Edoofa for the assistance with $100 for the startup
13/1/24, 12:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Indeed, sir. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
13/1/24, 12:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Hence, there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
13/1/24, 12:53 PM - +263 78 648 1446: No we stay in Bulawayo
13/1/24, 12:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
13/1/24, 12:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
13/1/24, 12:58 PM - +263 78 648 1446: Thank you please do so
13/1/24, 1:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
13/1/24, 1:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
13/1/24, 1:05 PM - +263 78 648 1446: Yes please
13/1/24, 1:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
13/1/24, 1:11 PM - +263 78 648 1446: Thank you  for the account details
13/1/24, 2:50 PM - +263 71 243 1513: Thanks for your efforts towards making our daughter achieve her academic dream affordably via scholarship, EWYL program and $ 100 towards admission process fee. My finances for January are tight,  may you allow us to pay the first installment by 26 February of $450 and second installments by 26 march 2024. I really want my daughter to enroll and benefit from this program.
13/1/24, 2:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As my operational hours for the day are coming to an end, I would like to schedule our next session on Monday at 8:30 AM. I hope the timing is suitable for you?
13/1/24, 2:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We may discuss any concerns during the same.

15/1/24, 9:21 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning, Parents and Natasha!

15/1/24, 9:21 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand. I would like to address your query tomorrow during our session.

16/1/24, 8:58 AM - +263 71 243 1513: Yes thank you
16/1/24, 2:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly. Please, I understand. As you are aware, students from around the world are actively pursuing this scholarship program, and a considerable number have already secured their scholarship seats. For the current month of January, 79 students have successfully secured their seats, leaving 21 seats available. Additionally, it's crucial to note that the benefits of the Endowment Program will remain valid until the end of this month. In my capacity as Natasha's admission officer, my priority is to ensure she secures her seat promptly, enabling her to gain admission to the best university for her higher education. I believe you enrolled her in this program with the intention of providing her with the finest educational opportunities. Do we share the same understanding on this matter?
16/1/24, 5:30 PM - +263 71 243 1513: Understood
16/1/24, 5:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know if you wish to proceed with the admission process now?
16/1/24, 6:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As my operational hours have concluded for the day, I would like to reschedule our session for 12:30 PM tomorrow to continue our discussion. Until then, take care and have a blessed night!

17/1/24, 12:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Natasha. How are you all doing today?
17/1/24, 12:59 PM - +263 78 648 1446: Good afternoon
17/1/24, 1:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Are you ready to continue with our discussion today, dear?
17/1/24, 1:03 PM - +263 71 243 1513: Yes may we proceed
17/1/24, 1:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
17/1/24, 1:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you?
17/1/24, 1:09 PM - +263 71 243 1513: For securing seat , admission processing fees, may l pay in two installments as follows $300 before 26 January 2024 and $600 by 26 February 2024 ?
17/1/24, 1:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, that is definitely possible. However, in order to get a better understanding of your situation, may I ask what are the challenges that you are facing that are causing you to not be able to follow the scheduled payment plan? The reason I am asking you this is because I need to get a better understanding of your situation in order to help you in my best capacity. As I mentioned earlier, only 21 seats are remaining, and as Natasha's admission officer, I would not want her to miss out on this opportunity to secure a scholarship seat along with the Endowment Program Benefits. I hope I am clear?
17/1/24, 1:19 PM - +263 71 243 1513: For January, l had already committed my funds , paid school fees for her two other brothers who started high school at a boarding school. I had a huge outlay of funds. Sorry for  bothering you.
17/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 71 243 1513: Are you still there?
17/1/24, 2:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand where you are coming from and thank you for sharing this with me. As a parent, planning for all your children's finances is important and the concern you have shared seems genuine. 

Under normal circumstances, if a student is unable to make the payment for their fee as per the due dates shared by the university, they end up losing out on their scholarship offer, and at the same time, Natasha is one of the fortunate students to benefit from the Endowment Program as well.
17/1/24, 2:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Hence, as Natasha's admisison officer admission officer, I wanted to understand your position better to see how best I can be of assistance. 

When I took over Mr. Shivjeet's duties as Natasha's admission officer, I went through her application thoroughly and I noticed a lot of things that make her stand out, such as her determination and objectivity and hence I have personally invested so much time to help Natasha secure a high quantum of scholarship.
17/1/24, 2:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With that said, ma'am, I believe the concern you have is genuine. I can see that you are a person who plans the way forward, and that is the reason you reshared your request to alter the payment plan – making a payment of $300 for the first part and the remaining amount next month. Hence, I will do my best to help you with the same request.
17/1/24, 2:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly allow me time until tomorrow to have a detailed discussion with the academic board, and I will certainly present a strong case in front of them. However, to do that, I will require your help. 

You will need to write an email to academicboard@edoofa.com explaining your situation and the requested payment plan. As Natasha's admission officer, I will present your case with utmost sincerity because Natasha's application is the most important to me at the moment. Once they approve your payment plan, we can go ahead and follow the payment plan suggested by you. I hope I am clear, and this will help you secure Natasha's scholarship seat with the university?
17/1/24, 2:40 PM - +263 71 243 1513: Thank you for your understanding and support you are offering us, for making Natasha achieve her academic dream at the low cost. May God bless you.
17/1/24, 2:41 PM - +263 71 243 1513: Will send the email soon
17/1/24, 2:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are welcome, sir. It is a pleasure of mine to be able to assist you in achieving your daughter's academic dream.
17/1/24, 2:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, shall we proceed with the letter discussion for now, so that you are able to get more clarity about the offer letter?
17/1/24, 2:56 PM - +263 71 243 1513: Yes let's pry
17/1/24, 2:56 PM - +263 71 243 1513: Let's proceed
17/1/24, 3:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
17/1/24, 3:36 PM - +263 71 243 1513: After the admissions processing fees seat securing , are there any other payments    before the annual fee balance ( $850.00) for planning purpose ?
17/1/24, 3:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: While you are in your home country, you only need to prepare and make the payment of the registration amount i.e., $1000 in your case in order to secure the scholarship seat. The remaining balance ($850) needs to be paid within 3 days of your arrival in India, and you need not make any other payments before that after completing the $1000 transaction. I hope this was helpful?
17/1/24, 3:44 PM - +263 71 243 1513: Thank you very helpful
17/1/24, 3:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that.

31/1/24, 12:10 PM - +263 71 243 1513: Hope I find you well, sorry for taking you back , is food included in hostel and accomodation?
31/1/24, 12:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mr. Kapfunde. I am well, thank you for asking. I hope everything is well on your end too.

The food/mess charges are not included in the accommodation charges mentioned in your offer letter, and as you are aware you have received 100% scholarship on accommodation only. However, *they do offer food services in the hostel, which have separate charges*. I hope this helps with your query?
31/1/24, 12:29 PM - +263 71 243 1513: Yes it was not clear , roughly how much can we spend per month on food?
31/1/24, 1:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. The food cost is between the range of $200 to $250 per annum. I hope this was helpful?
31/1/24, 2:10 PM - +263 71 243 1513: Helpful , thank you. Does the food cater for African students who does not take chili and too many spices. Sorry to ask this.
31/1/24, 2:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. You must be concerned about the difference in culture and food over here. However, I must highlight that this is an opportunity for Natasha to come out of her comfort zone to experience the new culture, environment and food that is present here in India, and I am sure with time she will be able to adjust and even gain a liking towards it.
31/1/24, 2:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With that being said, since there are quite a number of international students at the university, they do cater to students' needs if they have difficulties with adjusting to the spices and food. Moreover, Natasha will also have other alternatives to the spicy food, and will have the option to cook for herself in the hostel itself! She will have the option of making tasty delights from back home whenever she feels like it. <This message was edited>
