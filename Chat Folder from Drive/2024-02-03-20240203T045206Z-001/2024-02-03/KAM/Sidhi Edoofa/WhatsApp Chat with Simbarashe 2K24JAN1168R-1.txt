After receiving your provisional offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

11/1/24, 9:08 AM - +91 83509 76168: Could you kindly acknowledge the same using voice notes, please?
11/1/24, 9:08 AM - +91 83509 76168: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 17th or 18th January 2024 for $200 and the 17th or 18th of February for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 17th or 18th January 2024. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
11/1/24, 9:08 AM - +91 83509 76168: I would tentatively go for the first option. But if I have enough funds, on the said date, I will pay the whole amount so as to speed up the process
