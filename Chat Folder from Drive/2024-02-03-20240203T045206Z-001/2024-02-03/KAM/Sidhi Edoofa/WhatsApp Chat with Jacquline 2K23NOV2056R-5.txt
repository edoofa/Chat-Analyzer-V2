19/12/23, 7:11 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well and blessed today. Please excuse me for the late reply. I was occupied with a university official today. May I know if you are available to proceed with our session?
20/12/23, 2:48 PM - +263 71 465 3213: we are fine.how are you
20/12/23, 3:23 PM - +263 71 465 3213: We are available
20/12/23, 6:10 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Jacquline!

I hope you are doing well today. I was not able to connect with you earlier as it was past my available hours at the moment. I would like to let you know that our available hours daily will be from 6:00 pm to 9:00 pm every day for this session. With that said may I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session?
20/12/23, 6:15 PM - +263 71 465 3213: yes
20/12/23, 7:16 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
20/12/23, 7:16 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
20/12/23, 7:17 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identifying reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
20/12/23, 7:17 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
20/12/23, 7:17 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
20/12/23, 7:22 PM - +263 77 560 7562: I agree
20/12/23, 7:23 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
20/12/23, 7:23 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 6:30 PM.
20/12/23, 7:23 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

21/12/23, 5:56 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Jacquline!

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. May I know if you are currently available so that we can proceed with the session for your admission process?
21/12/23, 5:58 PM - +263 71 465 3213: Yes
21/12/23, 6:52 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for submitting the SOP form. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
21/12/23, 6:53 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Cardiovascular Technology) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
21/12/23, 6:59 PM - +263 71 465 3213: Yes it is accurate
21/12/23, 7:16 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
21/12/23, 7:16 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
21/12/23, 7:16 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
21/12/23, 7:24 PM - +263 71 465 3213: yes l am wondering how it works.l want to learn more
21/12/23, 8:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.

*Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.

*Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.
21/12/23, 8:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.

*Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
21/12/23, 8:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
21/12/23, 8:12 PM - +263 71 465 3213: it is
21/12/23, 8:33 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
21/12/23, 8:33 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in December 2023, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
21/12/23, 8:34 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
21/12/23, 8:34 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
21/12/23, 8:36 PM - +263 71 465 3213: yes l agree
21/12/23, 8:39 PM - +263 71 465 3213: how the Edoofa secure plan works
21/12/23, 8:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow properly. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
21/12/23, 9:00 PM - +263 71 465 3213: Thank you
28/12/23, 6:02 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

As it has been a while. May I know how are you doing today?
28/12/23, 7:12 PM - +263 71 465 3213: fine
28/12/23, 7:15 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
28/12/23, 7:17 PM - +263 71 465 3213: We can
28/12/23, 7:55 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
28/12/23, 8:32 PM - +263 71 465 3213: yes
28/12/23, 8:35 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
28/12/23, 8:35 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
28/12/23, 8:35 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
28/12/23, 8:38 PM - +263 71 465 3213: It is helpful
28/12/23, 9:09 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
28/12/23, 9:12 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As much as I wanted to proceed with the session my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow properly again. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
29/12/23, 6:13 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well today. May I know if you are currently available to proceed with the session for the admission process?
29/12/23, 6:38 PM - +263 71 465 3213: We are fine and you
29/12/23, 6:39 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know by when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
29/12/23, 6:39 PM - +263 71 465 3213: We may proceed
29/12/23, 6:41 PM - +263 71 465 3213: We are on School and festival Holiday  here in Zimbabwe
29/12/23, 6:42 PM - +263 71 465 3213: We have visited  our rural home
29/12/23, 6:42 PM - +263 71 465 3213: We will let you know
29/12/23, 7:07 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In that case shall we connect on 2nd of Jan 2024?
6/1/24, 11:57 AM - Shivjeet Edoofa added Dev Edoofa
6/1/24, 12:31 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Parents of Jacquline,

6/1/24, 12:31 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the same spirit, I would like to share that I am embarking on a journey as I prepare myself to pursue my doctorate and take a step forward in my academic pursuits. This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.
6/1/24, 12:31 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The decision to transition to a new phase in my life presents an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of students, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience remain enriched and fulfilling.

As I embark on this new journey, I want to assure you that I have entrusted your application file to capable hands. From this point forward, your admission journey will be seamlessly guided by one of our accomplished admission officers, *Mr. Dev,* who will connect with you on Monday.  I hope you will make yourself available for further procedures and will give your best to your career.
6/1/24, 12:31 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments. Wish you all the best, and God Bless.

Regards,
Mr. Shiveet

6/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 71 465 3213: Thank you so much for the time we had together.We as a family we wish you the best in what ever you want to achieve
9/1/24, 9:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Jacquline,

I will be guiding you toward realizing your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
9/1/24, 9:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
9/1/24, 9:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test. This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
9/1/24, 9:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
10/1/24, 2:09 PM - +263 71 465 3213: We are fine
10/1/24, 2:10 PM - +263 71 465 3213: Thanks to hear from you
12/1/24, 9:16 AM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome and I hope you are excited for the new day and most importantly the new year as well. @~Sterae, the new year brings about a transformative mindset in us which may not emphasize immediate changes but a change in the direction that you believe is needed.

If I talk about myself, I have made a resolution to bring more humility in myself and bring about a change in my perspective to be a better version of myself all while ensuring that I help all of our students to achieve their educational goals. With that said, I would like to know what aspirations or a change in your approach towards life you wish to achieve?
12/1/24, 1:02 PM - +263 71 465 3213: Jacqueline is at School right now
12/1/24, 1:04 PM - +263 71 465 3213: Her aspirations are

We will be able to help you only if we can connect timely and have healthy discussions.
12/1/24, 8:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, this is something I want to inform you all that the agenda for the discussions, that we are going to have, is to help you all understand the process you will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since you are going to be occupied with school and your parents are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
12/1/24, 8:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January]. This way, we can align it with our availability as well and help you move forward and make progress in a streamlined manner. Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your input and find the right time for our sessions.
12/1/24, 8:18 PM - +263 71 465 3213: We will be free starting from 03:00PM

26/1/24, 9:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Jacquline,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa*. Recently I was having a discussion with the Academic Board. They highlighted  that you have not been able to proceed with your admission process in a timely manner, since your child is at school and you have been occupied with work. Hence, I pitched in that I will be able to help you out and take over your application profile so that together we can ensure a timely and smooth progress. Since my operational hours accommodate your timings more suitably, I will be assuming the duties of your admission officer. I am optimistic that together, we can pave the way for an auspicious beginning to your academic journey, resulting in the right career prospects and eventual success for both you and your family.
26/1/24, 9:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

27/1/24, 1:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are fine. I am doing well too, thank you for asking. Since this is the first time we are interacting, allow me to introduce myself.

27/1/24, 2:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is my pleasure. I was going through Jacquline's application profile, and it is my understanding that you were successfully introduced to Edoofa's Financial Secure Plan. May I know if I am correct?
27/1/24, 2:25 PM - +263 71 465 3213: yes
27/1/24, 2:26 PM - +263 71 465 3213: but l would like to ask some few questions
27/1/24, 3:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Sure. Kindly share your queries or thoughts about the same if you have any.
27/1/24, 3:32 PM - +263 71 465 3213: l have already invested my money in a small business is it a must to save with you
27/1/24, 4:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The Financial Secure Plan is not mandatory for the students, and if you wish to save the money in your own bank account that is perfectly reasonable. However, since we are carefully planning and personalising every student's finances, we will require your help and cooperation to do so. The end goal is to ensure that you are successfully able to save up $1500 in the next 10 months so that you are not subjected to any difficulties when your child comes to India next year in 2025. In order to do that, you can deposit your money in your bank account and share the receipt with us every month so that we are also able to keep a track of your savings and help you plan for the future accordingly. I hope we are together in this?
27/1/24, 4:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand that Jacquline has school during the weekdays and you are occupied with work. In such a case, I want to ensure that our sessions are held in a timely and smooth manner so we can comfortably proceed with your application process. Could you kindly suggest a 1-hour slot between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM when we can have our sessions?

Until then, please take care and kindly extend my regards to your family as well!
27/1/24, 5:40 PM - +263 71 465 3213: thank you

29/1/24, 5:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, Parents and Jacquline. For the current round of students, there are only 27 seats available for the students who can benefit from the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. 

Since you have been one of the most dedicated students, and I see you have great aspirations, I wanted you to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.
29/1/24, 5:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of January, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
29/1/24, 5:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
29/1/24, 5:32 PM - +263 71 465 3213: Stanley has the money already in his account will sent you the proof
29/1/24, 5:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As much as I would like to continue with our discussion, since my operational hours for the day have already concluded and I have had a long day, I would like to reconnect with you tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the Financial Secure Plan and admission process. Until then, please take care and have a blessed day ahead!
30/1/24, 2:08 AM - +263 71 465 3213: thank you
30/1/24, 3:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Jacqulin. I hope everything is well on your end. How are you all doing today?
30/1/24, 7:05 PM - +263 71 465 3213: We are fine
30/1/24, 7:06 PM - +263 71 465 3213: There was no electricity the phone battery was Low very sorry
31/1/24, 9:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Jacqulin. I hope your day is going well. I understand that you were having power challenges yesterday. I am glad that we can reconnect today. May I know if you have stable connection and power to continue with our discussion?
31/1/24, 9:35 AM - +263 71 465 3213: yes
31/1/24, 10:07 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Thank you for letting me know.  Continuing our conversation from yesterday, you mentioned that Stanley has the money in his account. May I know if this means that you do not wish to proceed with the Financial Secure Plan?
31/1/24, 10:12 AM - +263 71 465 3213: We wish to save  the money on our own
31/1/24, 10:14 AM - +263 71 465 3213: if the money is needed during the course let us know
31/1/24, 10:31 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. That's absolutely fine is you wish to save the amount in your bank. However, that would mean that you are paying $15 extra every month to the bank in order to keep your money in the account. Moreover, with Edoofa's plan, you also get the addiitonal benefit of waiving off the remaining $150 from the Edoofa enrollment fee.
31/1/24, 10:32 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you wish to not avail the benefits and want to deposit the amount in your bank, you will have to share the same receipt with us every month. This is because our end goal is to ensure that the student is able to save money to come to India for their higher education. Since we are carefully planning and personalizing every student's finances, the receipt will help us to keep track of your savings so that we can together plan ahead. In order to ensure that, we will require your support and cooperation. I hope you are following?
31/1/24, 10:36 AM - +263 71 465 3213: yes we are following
31/1/24, 3:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of the same. I would also like to highlight that with the Financial Secure Plan, you are indirectly getting the benefit of paying the registration amount towards university fees in installments. Allow me to help you understand this better.

For the students with intake year as 2024, once their admission process is complete and they receive offer letters from the university, they are required to pay the registration amount of $500 - $1000 within 15 days of receiving the offer letter, or they are at a risk of losing their scholarship seat with the university.
31/1/24, 3:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With the Financial Secure Plan, it is an indirect opportunity for you to pay the registration amount in easy installments of $150 per month, relieving you from the burden of accumulating a hefty amount of $500 to $1000 within just 15 days after receiving the offer letter. May I know if you were able to follow through?
31/1/24, 3:39 PM - +263 71 465 3213: l have understood your concern and l am grateful but l also have own means of savings
31/1/24, 3:39 PM - +263 71 465 3213: if the money is needed just notified us
31/1/24, 4:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In such a case, you will not be eligible to avail the benefit of $150 waiver, may I know if you are okay with that?
31/1/24, 4:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moving forward, we will reconnect with you in the month of August when the universities begin accepting applications for the 2025 intake. You will have to be prepared with an amount of $1000, as once you have received your offer letter, you will be required to make the payment within 15 days of receiving the letter. May I know if we are on the same page here?
31/1/24, 5:42 PM - +263 71 465 3213: yes we are on the same page
31/1/24, 7:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Thank you for letting me know that. I respect your decision. However, since the plan has no demerits and instead offers you benefits of a $150 waiver with a flexible payment plan, I am failing to understand why you do not wish to invest in the Financial Secure Plan. Could you kindly help me understand your thought process better? As your admission officer, a better understanding of your thought process will allow me to assist you in a better and more efficient way.
31/1/24, 7:27 PM - +263 71 465 3213: We need to generate More money instead of saving l would spin that money in my small business and have profit that how we survive here
1/2/24, 9:29 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Jacqulin. I hope you are all doing great today.

Thank you for elaborating your concern. I understand please. You are indeed correct, that in order to keep making profits you need to keep reinvesting your money in it. However, my concern is that in the past 2 years, about 20-30% students who had successfully enrolled with us lost their scholarship seats due to not being able to meet the deadline. They were perfectly capable of making the payment, however due to some unforeseen challenges, they faced financial crisis. Since they did not have any prior savings, they lost out on the opportunity. This is the reason why we have introduced the Financial Secure Plan exclusively for the 2025 intake, so that we can help the parents and students plan their finances ahead of time, to ensure that you do not face any challenges in Jacquline's higher education due to any unpredicted situations.
1/2/24, 9:35 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand that you plan on growing your business and expect that when the time comes, you will have the resources in hand. But god forbid, if you happen to face any unforeseen situation, I am sure that you would not wish for Jacqulin's future to be in jeopardy. The Financial Secure Plan is going be Jacqulin's financial safety net, that will ensure that under any circumstances she is able to achieve her dreams. This can only be achieved with planning and consistency, and if we work together, I am sure that we will be able to accomplish the same. I hope we are together in this?
1/2/24, 9:39 AM - +263 71 465 3213: We are together Jacqueline is at boarding school.Here in Zimbabwe boarding school ranges from $500 upwards.We have never failed to plan for her and other siblings
1/2/24, 9:40 AM - +263 71 465 3213: We as teachers ourselves we really value education very much
1/2/24, 11:23 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. I am in no way trying to indicate that you will not be able to arrange for the resources. As teachers, I am sure that you understand the importance of education more than others do, and hence you will not compromise with your children's education. However, my only concern is that sometimes unfortunate things and situations happen that bring new challenges and difficulties along with them, and they come unannounced. I am sure you agree with me Mrs. Chipadza?
1/2/24, 12:34 PM - +263 71 465 3213: l agree challenges and difficulties are part of life
1/2/24, 3:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Indeed Mrs. Chipadza. In such a case, I am sure that you agree that having a safety plan is always beneficial. We do not know what kind of challenges or difficulties we might face in the future, it is not in our control. What we can control is, how well-prepared we are for such situations.

I was going through Jacqulin's application file and the values that you have instilled in her are very clearly visible. I am confident that there is no doubt that when required, you will be able to accumulate the resources for her. However, if I may ask, do you not think it is better to plan safely for the future and simultaneously invest in your business?
1/2/24, 5:06 PM - +263 71 465 3213: We have decided to save on our own for several reasons which maybe personal and private Thank you for your concern.You have to let us know when the money is needed
2/2/24, 3:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. I respect your decision to not go ahead with the Financial Secure Plan. In such a case, you will be required to write an email to the Academic Board of Edoofa on academicboard@edoofa.com , mentioning that you were introduced to the Financial Secure Plan, however you do not wish to go ahead with the same and instead want to opt for saving the money in your own bank account.

Kindly also mention the name of your admission group i.e., Jacquline 2K23NOV2056R.
2/2/24, 8:02 PM - +263 71 465 3213: ok thank you
