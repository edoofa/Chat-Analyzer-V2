It is alright, may I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session?
4/1/24, 6:46 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Good evening sir
Yes I am ready
4/1/24, 7:00 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
4/1/24, 7:00 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
4/1/24, 7:01 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Yes they are clear
4/1/24, 7:17 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
4/1/24, 7:17 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
4/1/24, 7:18 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Yes sir
4/1/24, 7:23 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
4/1/24, 7:23 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
4/1/24, 7:24 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Yes sir
4/1/24, 8:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
4/1/24, 9:00 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Ok sir
4/1/24, 9:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
4/1/24, 9:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
4/1/24, 9:05 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Ok sir u can

9/1/24, 9:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.

12/1/24, 10:41 AM - +263 77 810 4432: Good morning sir.
So as of this year I'm writing my final examinations. I'm a bit scared but am willing to risk it all I really wish to pass with flying colors. I want to make a difference in the world and become a successful somebody to make myself and those that look up to me proud.
12/1/24, 4:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that your academics are your main priority and want to become a better version of yourself by helping others in need.

However, since you are going to be occupied with school and your parents are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
12/1/24, 4:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January].

I hope you are having a wonderful day. Kindly excuse me for not being able to respond to your message last night as our team is currently working tirelessly towards the preparation of our upcoming Zimbabwe trip in the month of February. Before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to ask how are you doing today?
2/2/24, 5:09 PM - +263 77 810 4432: We're doing just fine ma'am.
How are you doing.
2/2/24, 5:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that Allen. I am fine too, thank you for asking. May I know if you were able to go through the videos that I shared with you day before yesterday?
2/2/24, 5:39 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Yes ma'am.
2/2/24, 5:39 PM - +263 77 810 4432: I did watch the videos.
2/2/24, 5:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: thank you for letting me know that. Could you kindly share your understanding of each video with me?
2/2/24, 5:48 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Ok so they were saying that as an Edoofian you should be able to be teachable and follow all the instructions.

They talked about how some people are making a business off giving scholarship but Edoofa is mostly concerned about the students' education, they'll enroll one in the best universities, universities which themselves have examined.

They talked about how Edoofa wants to make students responsible before entering into the world.

And in the last video they talked about the Statement of Purpose.They said a form will be sent and the student needs to fill in the form.
2/2/24, 6:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
2/2/24, 6:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of tomorrow.
2/2/24, 6:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
2/2/24, 6:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
2/2/24, 6:56 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Ok ma'am thank you.
2/2/24, 8:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
2/2/24, 8:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let us reconnect tomorrow for our session to proceed with the next steps. I wish you a blessed night, Allen!
2/2/24, 8:34 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Thank you ma'am.
Goodnight.
