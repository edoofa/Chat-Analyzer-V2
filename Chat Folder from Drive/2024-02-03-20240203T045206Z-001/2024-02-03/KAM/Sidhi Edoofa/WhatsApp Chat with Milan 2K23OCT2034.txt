26/1/24, 9:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Milan,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa*. Recently I was having a discussion with the Academic Board. They highlighted  that you have not been able to proceed with your admission process in a timely manner, since your child is at school and you have been occupied with work. Hence, I pitched in that I will be able to help you out and take over your application profile so that together we can ensure a timely and smooth progress. Since my operational hours accommodate your timings more suitably, I will be assuming the duties of your admission officer. I am optimistic that together, we can pave the way for an auspicious beginning to your academic journey, resulting in the right career prospects and eventual success for both you and your family.
26/1/24, 9:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

I would like to schedule our session for 10:30 AM tomorrow, so that we can discuss the progress and the next steps to be taken for your admission journey.
26/1/24, 9:30 PM - +263 77 821 3898: *10:30 AM* is tricky... Can we make it *1:30 PM*?
27/1/24, 10:40 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Milan. Thank you for letting me know of your availability. In such a case, we will reschedule our discussion for 1:30 PM today. Until we reconnect, I hope you have a blessed day ahead!
27/1/24, 1:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Milan. I hope you are having a lovely day. How are you all doing today?
27/1/24, 1:52 PM - +263 77 821 3898: It's fine, how are you
27/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 77 821 3898: Sorry for the delay
27/1/24, 2:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am doing fine, thank you for asking. Since this is the first time we are interacting, allow me to introduce myself. I am Miss Siddhi Singh, your Admission Officer. I belong from the vibrant city of Varanasi, known as one of the oldest living cities globally, Beyond my passion for education, I find joy in music and playing basketball. It is my pleasure to assist and guide you through the admission process, ensuring you achieve your dream education in India with the support of Edoofa.
27/1/24, 3:00 PM - +263 77 821 3898: Nice to meet you
27/1/24, 4:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is my pleasure. I was going through your application profile and it is my understanding that you had successfully completed the 2nd step of the admission cycle i.e., Statement of Purpose. May I know if I am correct?
27/1/24, 4:31 PM - +263 77 821 3898: Yes you're correct
27/1/24, 5:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. I understand that you have school during the weekdays and your parents are occupied with work. In such a case, I want to ensure that our sessions are held in a timely and smooth manner so we can comfortably proceed with your application process. Could you kindly suggest a 1-hour slot between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM when we can have our sessions?
27/1/24, 11:20 PM - +263 77 821 3898: 10:00 am
29/1/24, 10:15 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Milan. I was unable to respond to your last message on Saturday as my operational hours had concluded. How are you all doing today?
30/1/24, 10:32 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Milan. I hope everything is well on your end. It seems like we were unable to connect yesterday, so I wanted to check in and see how you all are doing today?
30/1/24, 10:34 AM - +263 77 308 4875: A very good morning to you too. Thank you for taking care. We are doing fine
30/1/24, 10:52 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are doing fine today. Our previous interaction was on Saturday, and you had confirmed that you have successfully completed the 2nd stage of the admission cycle. May I know if you are currently available to move forward with our discussion?
31/1/24, 10:50 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Milan. I hope you are all doing well today. I was hoping to get a response from your end yesterday, but it seems like due to some reason we were unable to connect with each other. However, I am glad that we can reconnect today and move forward with our discussion. Before we do so, I wanted to check in on you and your family. How is your day going so far?
31/1/24, 11:23 AM - +263 77 821 3898: It's okay, just super hectic... How is your day?
31/1/24, 11:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand. My day has been going pretty well, thank you for asking. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BBA and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
31/1/24, 11:41 AM - +263 77 821 3898: Yes it is 🙂
31/1/24, 12:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
31/1/24, 12:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
31/1/24, 12:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
31/1/24, 12:04 PM - +263 77 821 3898: Yes I'm curious
31/1/24, 12:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
31/1/24, 12:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
31/1/24, 12:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
31/1/24, 12:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
31/1/24, 12:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
31/1/24, 12:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
1/2/24, 11:02 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Milan. I hope you are having a wonderful day! How are you doing today?
1/2/24, 11:06 AM - +263 77 821 3898: We're doing good, how are?
1/2/24, 11:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am fine too, thank you for asking. I was hoping to get a response from your end yesterday, however it seems like we were unable to connect due to some reason. May I know if you were able to go through my previous messages Milan?
1/2/24, 11:39 AM - +263 77 821 3898: Yes
1/2/24, 11:40 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
1/2/24, 11:50 AM - +263 77 821 3898: Yes please
1/2/24, 1:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for responding late. 

I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
1/2/24, 1:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
1/2/24, 1:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
1/2/24, 1:52 PM - +263 77 821 3898: Yes
1/2/24, 5:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
1/2/24, 5:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
1/2/24, 5:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
1/2/24, 6:11 PM - +263 77 821 3898: To be honest I'm actually seeing a very clear picture 🙂
1/2/24, 6:11 PM - +263 77 821 3898: Thank you
2/2/24, 10:23 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Milan.

I hope you are having a lovely morning. Kindly excuse me for not being able to respond to your message last night as our operational hours had already concluded.
2/2/24, 10:24 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: We were discussing the Financial Secure Plan during our previous conversation. Continuing the same, I am pleased to hear that you are able to see a clear picture. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
2/2/24, 10:24 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
2/2/24, 10:24 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
2/2/24, 10:24 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
2/2/24, 10:29 AM - +263 77 821 3898: Yes
2/2/24, 10:38 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
2/2/24, 10:52 AM - +263 77 821 3898: Yes please
2/2/24, 1:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you have paid.
2/2/24, 1:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
2/2/24, 1:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
2/2/24, 1:07 PM - +263 77 821 3898: Yes!
2/2/24, 1:07 PM - +263 77 821 3898: Why isn't it more than 10 months
2/2/24, 1:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
2/2/24, 1:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
2/2/24, 1:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
2/2/24, 1:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
