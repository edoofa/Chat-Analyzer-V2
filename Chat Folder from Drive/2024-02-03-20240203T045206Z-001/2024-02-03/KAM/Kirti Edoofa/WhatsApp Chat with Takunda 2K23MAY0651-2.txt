I trust this message finds you well. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admission Officer at Edoofa*. I will be handling the next steps in your university admission journey and will be directing you in the right direction. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
16/1/24, 9:52 AM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
16/1/24, 9:52 AM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?

16/1/24, 7:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. With great excitement and pride, I also want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
16/1/24, 7:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
16/1/24, 7:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
16/1/24, 7:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we discuss your admission journey further, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

I hope you are doing well. I am glad to know that you did go through the message above. Indeed you will be apart of these events once you arrive in India. Over the past couple of days, we also had the pleasure of conversing with some of our students who expressed their joy upon receiving their A-Level results.

Reflecting on my own school days, I vividly recall the mix of excitement and anticipation surrounding the result day. It is an important moment that shapes the path of one’s academic journey.
17/1/24, 9:42 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
17/1/24, 11:40 AM - +263 71 717 1647: <Media omitted>

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
17/1/24, 11:45 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly allow me time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward.

Please excuse me for not connecting in the past few days, I have been currently dealing with an unexpected family emergency and have taken some time off to provide support to my loved ones during this challenging time and that is why I have not been able to get back to you, however, given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion.

2/2/24, 12:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Takunda.

I hope you are doing well. Since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
2/2/24, 12:57 PM - +263 71 717 1647: We are available
2/2/24, 1:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing now coming back to the challenges that you shared we were able to have a discussion with the board and the university officials as well and they did consider your concern genuine because you were in two minds because the payment mode was not clear to you, so for me to have a clear understanding could you please help me understand what concerns were you facing with the payment mode please?
2/2/24, 1:32 PM - +263 71 717 1647: l need to change the programme which l used to share with you
2/2/24, 1:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: may I know why do you wish to change the program?
2/2/24, 1:40 PM - +263 71 717 1647: Future beholds plus the way you see yourself in the next generation of years the world is changing l need something which l had interest with
2/2/24, 1:48 PM - +263 71 717 1647: l need to do something which l have passion on
2/2/24, 1:52 PM - +263 77 657 0486: It's taku.s mom the payment mode was that  to you were talking about the endowment plan so  it was specifically for us to pay the   registration fee the whole $750  before the due date of closure to meet the benefits of it . So by that time that,s when takunda.s sibling got sick  so I end up getting confusion till the  date came closer.  I asked if it was possible to pay  the first part of it then  finish the other one
2/2/24, 1:58 PM - +263 71 717 1647: Like my mom said there was a problem in the house and it gets us confused but now we are  ready if you give us the plan
2/2/24, 2:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know now I have a better understanding of your situation, however, the endowment plan is for your benefit let me help you understand that there was a $150 grant which is given to you, and hence the total that you were supposed to pay is $550 and as per your discussion with Mr. Milan I believe he did explain that you will be able to pay the this $550 in two equal installments, may be you can help me understand better?
2/2/24, 2:14 PM - +263 77 657 0486: Okay that's where I got lost to my understanding   ithought it was supposed to be paid all to meet the benefits  lam so sorry for  that   and I think that's when  my child was sick so I would sometimes   browsing   your discussion due to confusion
2/2/24, 2:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263776570486 it is completely alright please, may I know if you wish to proceed with the payment now to secure seat for Takunda?
2/2/24, 2:28 PM - +263 77 657 0486: Yes   iam willing to proceed
2/2/24, 2:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263776570486 that is great to know. Now while it was really difficult to have a discussion regarding keeping Takunda's seat since LPU is one of the best universities in India, however, I was able to have a discussion with the university officials personally because since the start Takunda has been one of my favorite students and I was determined to assist you and that is why after multiple discussions I was able to make the university understand the concerns you shared with us above previously and they did understand the same.
2/2/24, 2:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Coming to the next part regarding the payment would you like me to share payment modes with you?
2/2/24, 2:37 PM - +263 77 657 0486: Ooo thank you  for telling me that Takunda was one of your favorite  students  . My  payment  mode   was that if fortune favours me. I would pay  half of the payment then complete the  remaining in  30 days
2/2/24, 2:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
2/2/24, 2:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
2/2/24, 3:13 PM - +263 77 657 0486: No  I don't reside in  Harare   we are alitt bit  far away  it's about 300k.s from Harare
2/2/24, 3:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
2/2/24, 3:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
2/2/24, 3:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
2/2/24, 3:19 PM - +263 77 657 0486: Okay thank you for  your assistance . I think    to connect with Mr  Rajan is the best since it's cheaper
2/2/24, 3:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
2/2/24, 3:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
2/2/24, 3:34 PM - +263 77 657 0486: Yes   please provide them  for me
2/2/24, 3:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference - 

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
2/2/24, 3:41 PM - +263 77 657 0486: Thank you once again
2/2/24, 3:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, now coming to the concern @263717171647 shared regarding his course change I would like to inform you that you can even change your course after your arrival in India, so please do not worry about it.
2/2/24, 3:49 PM - +263 77 657 0486: Yaaaa well informed
2/2/24, 3:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, for me to update the university officials as well could you please confirm the date for me when are you making the payment of the first installment of $275?
2/2/24, 3:58 PM - +263 77 657 0486: Friday the 9th of  Feb  this month
2/2/24, 4:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your confirmation with me, it is duly noted with us and I shall update the university officials as well.
2/2/24, 4:12 PM - +263 77 657 0486: Okay thank you for your time with us  your patience
2/2/24, 4:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome and have a blessed day ahead.
2/2/24, 4:28 PM - +263 77 657 0486: Thank you
