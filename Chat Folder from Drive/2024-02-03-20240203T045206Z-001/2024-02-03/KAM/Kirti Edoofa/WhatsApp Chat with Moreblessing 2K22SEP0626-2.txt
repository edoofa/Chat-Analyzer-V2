12/1/24, 5:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Moreblessing,

I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
12/1/24, 5:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
12/1/24, 5:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
12/1/24, 7:12 PM - +263 78 426 2482: A good day to you,,,, thank you so much for checking on us,,,, we are all very well and looking forward to a better 2024
12/1/24, 7:16 PM - +263 78 426 2482: It's good and inspiring to hear about your country's scientific research achievements. One can only wish you as a people, as a country, and as a nation a prosperous 2024 and beyond
12/1/24, 8:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear your views. With great excitement and pride, I also want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
12/1/24, 8:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
12/1/24, 8:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we discuss your admission journey further, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

16/1/24, 10:23 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Moreblessing.

I hope you are doing well. Since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday I wanted to reach out and know more about your A-level results. We also had the pleasure of conversing with some of our students who expressed their joy upon receiving their A-Level results.

Reflecting on my own school days, I vividly recall the mix of excitement and anticipation surrounding the result day. It is an important moment that shapes the path of one’s academic journey.
16/1/24, 10:23 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

16/1/24, 10:44 AM - +263 78 426 2482: We also have encouraged her to our daughter to look for some employment so she could possibly supplement whatever we will get and it is our hope she finds a job
17/1/24, 8:01 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Moreblessing.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for asking I am doing great. Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

17/1/24, 8:01 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly allow me time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once I have evaluated your results, along with all the other applications for your university admission, we will reconnect with you to discuss the next steps in your academic journey.

25/1/24, 11:53 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Moreblessing,

I hope this message finds you all well and in high spirits. I apologize for not being in touch over the past few days. Unfortunately, I was dealing with a significant ENT infection and needed to follow my doctor's recommendation for rest, which meant taking some time off to prioritize my health. As a result, I was unable to inform you about my temporary absence. Thankfully, I'm feeling considerably better now and am ready to resume our interactions. Before we proceed with our discussion, I'd like to catch up - how have you and your family been lately?
25/1/24, 6:32 PM - +263 78 185 2032: Good day maam I'm glad you now feeling better
25/1/24, 6:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings. Thank you for your concern, I appreciate it. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
25/1/24, 6:38 PM - +263 78 185 2032: Yes I am available
25/1/24, 6:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing with regard to our previous conversation may I know if you are ready to proceed with Moreblessing's application now?
25/1/24, 6:45 PM - +263 78 185 2032: We are facing some financial challenges at the moment we were hoping if it's possible for me to apply for 2025
25/1/24, 6:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263781852032 may I know what challenges are you facing due to which you wish to defer Moreblessing's year of intake? <This message was edited>
25/1/24, 6:49 PM - +263 78 185 2032: It's Moreblessing speaking my parents are currently offline can they reply once they are online
25/1/24, 7:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, it is alright please, I will be waiting for their response.
25/1/24, 7:08 PM - +263 78 185 2032: Okay maam
25/1/24, 8:52 PM - +263 78 426 2482: A good evening to you  Ma'am,,,, sorry for the late response
25/1/24, 9:06 PM - +263 78 426 2482: So the thing is we were hoping to have financially stabilised by December, but we were unfortunate as we had to move out of our rented house. We had to move to our unfinished building (house) and all the little resources we had, we channelled it at trying to make this place livable.  So that's why we thought if its possible then we can defer Moreblessing's admission to next year
25/1/24, 9:09 PM - +263 78 426 2482: We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience caused.
25/1/24, 9:20 PM - +263 78 426 2482: By the way we are happy to hear that you are recovering well from your illness, we wish you a total recovery
26/1/24, 1:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Moreblessing. 

I hope you are doing well. On the auspicious occasion of Republic Day, I extend my heartfelt greetings to you and your loved ones. Today marks a significant moment in our nation's history, a day when we commemorate the enactment of our Constitution and celebrate the enduring spirit of democracy and unity that defines us as a country.
26/1/24, 1:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 1:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand the challenges that you are going through, however, before we discuss changing Moreblessing's year of intake I would like to understand what are your plans for her are you willing to wait for another year while her peers move abroad for studies?
26/1/24, 1:28 PM - +263 78 426 2482: Afternoon ma'am i hope i find you well. A happy anniversary on this auspicious day.

Now coming to the question of whether we are willing to wait for another year while her peers move abroad for studies,,,, let me first of all assure you ma'am that we as parents will always want the best for our daughter and we have been trying all our best to achieve that. However dear ma'am,   unforeseen circumstances befell us and its so unfortunate its something beyond our control. Once again we apologise for the inconveniences
26/1/24, 1:31 PM - +263 78 426 2482: We really want her to pursue her educational journey  that's why we are requesting for the alternative
26/1/24, 2:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263784262482 Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me; I appreciate gaining insight into your perspective. Reflecting back on our conversation in September, I remember you expressed a desire to proceed with Moreblessing's admission through the standard process, due to financial constraints at the time. Given this, I'm curious to know how you prepared over the past three months to support Moreblessing's education, especially considering you were already aware of the associated costs. Could you kindly share the steps you took during this period to contribute towards her educational expenses?
2/2/24, 3:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Moreblessing.

I hope you are doing well.  I'm writing to follow up on the messages shared above. I noticed that you have not responded to the message above.

Therefore, I am reaching out to you once more to inquire if you have had a chance to read my earlier message and to confirm whether we are still in communication.
2/2/24, 3:39 PM - +263 78 185 2032: Afternoon ma'am
2/2/24, 4:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if your parents were able to go through the message above?
