16/1/24, 9:37 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Rachel,

I trust this message finds you well. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admission Officer at Edoofa*. I would like to inform you that Mr. Shivjeet will no longer be available, as he is advancing in his career with a new opportunity. While his departure is a loss for us, we are also filled with pride and joy for his future endeavors. Moving forward, I will be handling the next steps in your university admission journey and will be directing you in the right direction.
16/1/24, 9:38 AM - Kirti Edoofa: As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test. This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
16/1/24, 9:38 AM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?

Reflecting on my own school days, I vividly recall the mix of excitement and anticipation surrounding the result day. It is an important moment that shapes the path of one’s academic journey.
16/1/24, 4:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

I hope this message finds you well. Please excuse me for not connecting in the past few days, I have been currently dealing with an unexpected family emergency and have taken some time off to provide support to my loved ones during this challenging time and that is why I have not been able to get back to you.
