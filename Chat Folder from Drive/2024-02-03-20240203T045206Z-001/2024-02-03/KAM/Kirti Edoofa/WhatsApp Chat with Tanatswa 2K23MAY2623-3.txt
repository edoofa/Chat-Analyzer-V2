2/1/24, 12:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your letter of recommendation, it is noted with us. The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned. <This message was edited>

11/1/24, 6:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Tanatswa,

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
11/1/24, 6:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
11/1/24, 6:18 PM - +263 71 351 1106: Good day we have gone through the offer letter
11/1/24, 6:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
11/1/24, 6:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
11/1/24, 6:22 PM - +263 71 351 1106: Okay
11/1/24, 6:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
11/1/24, 6:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
11/1/24, 6:25 PM - +263 71 351 1106: Before we begin I noticed an error on the letter country it's Zimbabwe not Zambia
11/1/24, 6:26 PM - +263 71 351 1106: 1   900
2   3 yrs 
3.   300
4 ) 750
11/1/24, 6:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, it must be a clerical error I have updated the team about the same, so please do not worry about that.
11/1/24, 6:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
11/1/24, 6:31 PM - +263 71 351 1106: Yes
11/1/24, 6:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
11/1/24, 6:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
11/1/24, 6:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
11/1/24, 6:33 PM - +263 71 351 1106: Iam following
11/1/24, 6:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
11/1/24, 6:34 PM - +263 71 351 1106: Yes
11/1/24, 6:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
11/1/24, 6:39 PM - +263 71 351 1106: Examination fee is it part of the tuition fee <This message was edited>
11/1/24, 6:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
11/1/24, 6:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on January 25th 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
11/1/24, 6:46 PM - +263 71 351 1106: Yes
11/1/24, 6:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
11/1/24, 6:50 PM - +263 71 351 1106: I shall have to pay half of registration fee in a period of a month
11/1/24, 6:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $650  of the registration fee. This $650 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$325 before the first deadline date of January 25, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$325  before the second deadline date of February 25, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
11/1/24, 6:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $650 within 15 working days, before *January 25, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
11/1/24, 6:53 PM - +263 71 351 1106: Okay let's continue
11/1/24, 6:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
11/1/24, 6:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
11/1/24, 6:56 PM - +263 71 351 1106: Near harare yes
11/1/24, 6:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
11/1/24, 6:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
11/1/24, 6:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
11/1/24, 6:59 PM - +263 71 351 1106: Thank you for sharing the contact information
11/1/24, 7:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
11/1/24, 7:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
11/1/24, 7:10 PM - +263 71 351 1106: Yes provide me with the account details
11/1/24, 7:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference - 

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
11/1/24, 7:11 PM - +263 71 351 1106: Thank you
11/1/24, 7:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
11/1/24, 7:13 PM - +263 71 351 1106: Thank you for that summary
11/1/24, 7:14 PM - +263 71 351 1106: I have a question also
11/1/24, 7:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome and yes please I will be more than happy to assist you here?
11/1/24, 7:17 PM - +263 71 351 1106: As you said before more offer letters will be coming my way so will I be able to wait for them and make informed decision is that correct <This message was edited>
11/1/24, 7:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
11/1/24, 7:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
11/1/24, 7:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
11/1/24, 7:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
11/1/24, 7:24 PM - +263 71 351 1106: Yes thank you
11/1/24, 7:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
11/1/24, 7:25 PM - +263 71 351 1106: No Englighten me <This message was edited>
11/1/24, 7:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
11/1/24, 7:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
11/1/24, 7:27 PM - +263 71 351 1106: Yes
11/1/24, 7:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
11/1/24, 7:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
11/1/24, 7:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
11/1/24, 7:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
11/1/24, 7:54 PM - +263 71 351 1106: Yes thank you very much
11/1/24, 8:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
11/1/24, 8:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
11/1/24, 8:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
11/1/24, 8:17 PM - +263 71 351 1106: Yes
11/1/24, 8:21 PM - +263 71 351 1106: So I shall research more on galgotias university with my parents and when we reach a decision I shall update you
11/1/24, 8:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely you can. It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
11/1/24, 8:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
11/1/24, 8:22 PM - +263 71 351 1106: No all is cleared
11/1/24, 8:23 PM - +263 71 351 1106: Thank you for sharing all the information with me
11/1/24, 8:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
11/1/24, 8:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Galgotias University, situated in Delhi NCR, boasts an impressive academic reputation, ranking among the top 100 universities in India. One of its notable achievements is obtaining NAAC A+ Accreditation in the First Cycle, setting the highest standard for academic excellence.

A significant factor contributing to Galgotias University's consistent recognition as a top institution is its 'students-first' philosophy. This approach prioritizes the well-being and success of its students and aligns with Edoofa's values and mission.

One of the university's standout features is its dedication to maintaining a low student-to-faculty ratio. This approach ensures that students receive ample personal attention and mentoring, fostering a supportive and nurturing learning environment.

11/1/24, 8:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasize the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
11/1/24, 8:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realising your dream of pursuing education abroad.
11/1/24, 8:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise.

We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?

13/1/24, 10:20 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Tanatswa!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Galgotias University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
13/1/24, 10:43 AM - +263 71 351 1106: Before we begin I shall like to share with you my A level results
13/1/24, 10:44 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely. We also had the pleasure of conversing with some of our students who expressed their joy upon receiving their A-Level results.

Reflecting on my own school days, I vividly recall the mix of excitement and anticipation surrounding the result day. It is an important moment that shapes the path of one’s academic journey.
13/1/24, 10:44 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education.
13/1/24, 10:45 AM - +263 71 351 1106: <Media omitted>
13/1/24, 10:45 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I'm sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will promptly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
13/1/24, 10:47 AM - +263 71 351 1106: Thank you @917292063289
13/1/24, 10:49 AM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome now  I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
13/1/24, 10:50 AM - +263 71 351 1106: Yes
13/1/24, 10:50 AM - Kirti Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
13/1/24, 11:00 AM - +263 71 351 1106: Regarding that we have not yet fully decided
13/1/24, 11:11 AM - Kirti Edoofa: @263713511106 may I know why were you not able to discuss the same, since it has been many days since we completed our letter discussion?
13/1/24, 11:19 AM - +263 71 351 1106: We are still weighing our options I shall get back to you as soon as we have decided
13/1/24, 12:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263713511106 Thank you for letting me know that. I would love to continue with our discussions however, I regret to inform you that I'm currently not feeling well. As a result, I just came to inform you that I would like to reschedule our discussion for Monday. I hope this works for you and that you'll be available to connect on Monday. Thank you for your understanding.
13/1/24, 12:35 PM - +263 71 351 1106: I understand feel better
17/1/24, 8:50 AM - +263 71 351 1106: Good morning @917292063289

24/1/24, 12:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tanatswa,

I trust you're all having a good day. I want to start by apologizing for my absence over the past week. Unfortunately, I was unwell with a severe ENT infection, which required me to rest as per my doctor's advice. Thankfully, I'm feeling much improved now and am eager to reconnect with you so we can continue our discussions. But before we proceed, I'm curious to hear about how your last week went?
24/1/24, 1:32 PM - +263 71 351 1106: Good day @917292063289
24/1/24, 4:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you are doing well. Since we were unable to connect previously so let us plan to connect tomorrow at 02:00 pm CAT so that we can go through any queries that you still have. I hope you will be available tomorrow have a blessed day ahead.
26/1/24, 1:48 PM - +263 71 351 1106: Greetings @917292063289
26/1/24, 2:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tanatswa!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the offer letter. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter as a collective?
26/1/24, 2:37 PM - +263 71 351 1106: Yes we reviewed the offer letter
26/1/24, 2:50 PM - +263 77 712 8484: Good @917292063289 iam Mr Makore I was wanting to ask you about the other offer letter so far we have seen only one
26/1/24, 2:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
26/1/24, 2:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
26/1/24, 2:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
26/1/24, 2:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Galgotias and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
26/1/24, 2:55 PM - +263 77 712 8484: Very well so we shall wait for a positive update from your end
26/1/24, 2:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
26/1/24, 2:59 PM - +263 77 712 8484: Iam very aware in that case can you provide us with list of the universities that you recommend then we can select
26/1/24, 3:01 PM - +263 77 712 8484: And also the universities you have dropped the applications for Tanatswa
26/1/24, 4:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is good to know you are aware of the transfer options. Since we are connected with more than 250+ universities providing you with the list will not be possible for me however, the some universities that are the best in India and where students want to get admissions are:

Lovely Professional University
Galgotias University 
PDM University
MVN University
26/1/24, 4:06 PM - +263 71 351 1106: Thank you for providing the short list so we shall wait for other offer letters
26/1/24, 4:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. It is alright please if you do not wish to reserve your seat with Galgotias University we completely respect your decision, however, if you wish to wait for more offers you can surely do that but if those offers do not align with your preference or you may consider that the amount asked might be expensive then please remember you would have even lost this opportunity, and that is the reason I would want you to think first make use of the transfer option and then select. If I were at your place I would keep two options open for myself rather than just waiting for the one.
26/1/24, 4:55 PM - +263 71 351 1106: Okay I shall update you
26/1/24, 4:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely may I know by when can I expect an update from you regarding your decision?
26/1/24, 4:57 PM - +263 71 351 1106: Is Monday alright
26/1/24, 5:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263713511106 since you missed your deadline already yesterday, however, I completely understand that my absence affected the process but, my health was also my priority at that time, and that is why I have discussed with the academic board to grant an extension till the 31st of January which is exactly when the university closes the round of applications for this month. Because I did not want my absence to affect you reserving your seat so surely you can update me by Monday.
26/1/24, 5:01 PM - +263 71 351 1106: Thank you very I shall update you regarding the same
29/1/24, 11:23 AM - +263 71 351 1106: Greetings
31/1/24, 11:32 AM - +263 71 351 1106: Hi @917292063289
31/1/24, 5:21 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Tanatswa,

I hope this message finds you well. I am *Ms. Vilsha, and I serve as the Head of Admissions at Edoofa*. Please excuse Ms. Kirti, she is currently dealing with an unexpected family emergency and has taken some time off to provide support to her loved ones during this challenging time.
31/1/24, 5:24 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: We at Edoofa extend our best wishes to her and her family, and we hope she gets through this tough situation as early as possible. At the same time, I hope you too share the same sentiments.
31/1/24, 5:25 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Also, while I was going through your scholarship application file, and noticed that you were supposed to make the payment of your first part of the university registration fee of $325 by 31st of January 2024.

Considering the same, I wanted to reach out to you, share a gentle reminder, and try to understand if you have been able to make the payment of your fee by now so that we can update the academic board and the university officials accordingly?
31/1/24, 5:26 PM - +263 71 351 1106: Greetings @918178723499  that is what reaching out for I lost the bank details of Mr shorwi
31/1/24, 5:29 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Oh, I am sorry to hear that, @263713511106. Please excuse us for not being able to connect with you earlier in the day; I had a few meetings scheduled. Shall I share the details with you right now so that you can make the payment of your fee first thing tomorrow?
31/1/24, 5:30 PM - +263 77 712 8484: Yes
31/1/24, 5:32 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
31/1/24, 5:32 PM - +263 71 351 1106: What is the percentage Interest
31/1/24, 5:33 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: The transfer charges are 12.5% of the amount you wish to send.
31/1/24, 5:34 PM - +263 77 712 8484: Good day @918178723499
31/1/24, 5:34 PM - +263 77 712 8484: Do you have an update on other universities
31/1/24, 5:42 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Good day to you as well, @263713511106

Yes, there are a few more updates that we are expecting to receive from universities like MVN University and Lovely Professional University within the next week. 

Once we get an update from them, we will promptly share it with you. Moreover, I believe Ms. Kirti must have assisted you in understanding the university admission process and how you can keep all your scholarship options open with the assistance of the transfer option.
31/1/24, 5:51 PM - +263 71 351 1106: I shall heed her words and update you if iam able to pay tomorrow
31/1/24, 5:56 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Indeed @263713511106, you can rely on the Transfer Option available, which is designed to offer students a wider choice of universities. 

As you are aware, the extended due date shared by the university was today, and unfortunately, you were unable to make the payment. We have a meeting scheduled with the university officials tomorrow at 2:00 PM to update them on the status of your application. Hence, I wanted to understand you, by what time will you be able to make the payment of your fee so that we can update them accordingly?
31/1/24, 6:48 PM - +263 71 351 1106: Tomorrow by 2pm cat  I won't be able to pay I will have to arrange for the payments to be done the fbc Bank is not in my town
1/2/24, 7:53 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: I see @263713511106. In that case, may I know by what time would you be able to make the payment of your fee so that we can see how best to help you in such a situation?
1/2/24, 9:10 AM - +263 71 351 1106: I will update as soon as I do so If Iam unable to we will just have to wait for other universities
1/2/24, 9:15 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: @263713511106, may I know why you feel as if you will not be able to make the payment of Tanatswa's registration fee today? With regards to the discussion you had with Ms. Kirti, it seems as if you have been preparing to reserve the scholarship seat before the 31st of January 2024 and that is the reason she liaised with the university as well to help you with an extension accordingly?
1/2/24, 9:18 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: Also, as Ms. Kirti and I shared with you earlier, if you prefer to wait for offers from other universities, you can certainly do so. 

However, it's important to note that Galgotias University has already granted you an extension to secure Tanatswa's scholarship seat. If you fail to meet the university's deadline, you risk losing this scholarship opportunity and will not be able to get the same opportunity again.

Considering this, if you receive better offers from other universities later on, and you decide that the offer from Galgotias University is best, what would be your plan of action since you would have already lost on the opportunity and to help you with this, you have been granted the access to the Transfer Option? Did I not get you well when you mentioned that you want Tanatswa to have all the university options open?
1/2/24, 9:21 AM - +263 77 712 8484: As I emphasized the FBC bank is not in my town so right now iam at work the most convenient day I can make the payment is weekend
1/2/24, 9:28 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: @263777128484, if you're facing challenges with the payment mode and FBC isn't easily accessible, you have alternative options such as Mukuru and Ecocash, you can proceed with those modes. 

At the same time, if processing the payment isn't feasible for you, Tantaswa can proceed with making the payment.
1/2/24, 9:29 AM - +263 77 712 8484: Ecocash and mukuru explain how I can make the payment
1/2/24, 9:30 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: As I have been sharing with you, providing another extension isn't possible. When Ms. Kirti extended the deadline until January 31st, I believe you must have recognized that the payment would need to be made on a working day, as it falls on a Wednesday and thus I am afraid we cannot help you with another extension till the weekend. 

You have to understand that you have applied for an International Scholarship and students all over the world are competing against the scholarship, if one misses the deadline, the same offer goes to some other student who was waitlisted and hence Tantaswa would miss out on this precious opportunity. I hope you are able to see the same perspective?
1/2/24, 9:32 AM - +263 77 712 8484: I understand
1/2/24, 9:33 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: With regards to this message of yours @263777128484, are you asking about the details of the account you can use for Mukuru or Ecocash, or are you enquiring how these payment modes work?
1/2/24, 9:33 AM - +263 77 712 8484: Yes
1/2/24, 9:39 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, @263777128484, I did not get you well, are you asking about the account details or the payment mode?
1/2/24, 9:39 AM - +263 71 351 1106: Yes the details
1/2/24, 9:48 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: Incase of *Mukuru/Ecocash/Innbucks Following are the Account Details*

1/2/24, 9:51 AM - +263 77 712 8484: And the interest is still 12.5%
1/2/24, 9:52 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, that is correct, the transfer charges are the same for all the modes.
1/2/24, 9:53 AM - +263 77 712 8484: Thank you
