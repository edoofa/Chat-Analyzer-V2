12/1/24, 6:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Anopaishe,

I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
12/1/24, 6:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
12/1/24, 6:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
13/1/24, 2:54 PM - +263 77 738 7544: We are all well please add Anopaishe on her new numbers 0774042943 . Thank you
15/1/24, 8:20 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Anopaishe.

I hope you are doing well. Surely I have granted you the admin please go ahead and add Anopaishe to the group.
16/1/24, 10:36 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Anopaishe.

I hope you are doing well. I was hoping to get a response from you however, you did not respond so I wanted to reach out and know more about your A-level results. We also had the pleasure of conversing with some of our students who expressed their joy upon receiving their A-Level results.

Reflecting on my own school days, I vividly recall the mix of excitement and anticipation surrounding the result day. It is an important moment that shapes the path of one’s academic journey.
16/1/24, 10:36 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
25/1/24, 11:57 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Anopaishe,

I trust you are all well. I'm writing to follow up on the messages shared above. I noticed that you have not responded for a long time now since the international scholarship is once in a lifetime opportunity your lack of response has left a negative response on the student's application. 

Therefore, I am reaching out to you once more to inquire if you have had a chance to read my earlier message and to confirm whether we are still in communication.

I hope you are doing well. Since we were not able to move further with our discussion may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can continue with our discussion?

26/1/24, 12:31 PM - +263 77 404 2943: start
26/1/24, 12:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
26/1/24, 12:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
26/1/24, 12:45 PM - +263 77 404 2943: sorry Miss Kirti l have already done that and also l paid my registration fee last year
26/1/24, 12:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. However, I believe what you are referring to is the Edoofa enrollment fee which is $350, which you have already paid, and the registration fee that you are referring to is a one-time payable fee that is a part of your first-year university tuition fee and is not an additional cost to be incurred by you. It is required to be paid once the university issues your offer letter. 

I hope you are clear now?
26/1/24, 1:21 PM - +263 77 404 2943: yes l got it
26/1/24, 1:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>

26/1/24, 1:46 PM - +263 77 404 2943: oky maam
26/1/24, 1:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please so could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
26/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 77 404 2943: sorry l am lost are you talking about the registration process of fees
26/1/24, 1:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, the once we discussed back in the month of July may I know if you recall that?
26/1/24, 1:58 PM - +263 77 404 2943: oky
26/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 77 404 2943: you said the university pay 85percent then l am supposed to earn while learning by motivate other student to join the edoofa
26/1/24, 2:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263774042943 thank you for sharing your understanding however, let me help you understand that we offer 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
26/1/24, 2:12 PM - +263 77 404 2943: no we can move forwad
26/1/24, 2:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
26/1/24, 2:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
26/1/24, 2:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 2:48 PM - +263 77 404 2943: woooh this is so nice l cant wait for my admission in August
26/1/24, 2:48 PM - +263 77 404 2943: cant wait.to receive my offer letter
26/1/24, 2:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, indeed @263774042943 . The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
26/1/24, 2:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
26/1/24, 2:50 PM - +263 77 404 2943: yes share with me please
26/1/24, 2:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.
26/1/24, 2:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $750. 

We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
26/1/24, 2:53 PM - +263 77 404 2943: sorry l am a bit lost so are you saying we are supposed to pay750
26/1/24, 2:55 PM - +263 77 404 2943: l want to know about programmes ...l am allowed to change my program
26/1/24, 5:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263774042943 yes please this $750 is  to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.
I hope we are clear here?
26/1/24, 5:04 PM - +263 77 404 2943: yes maam noted
26/1/24, 5:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly may I know which program do you have in mind please?
