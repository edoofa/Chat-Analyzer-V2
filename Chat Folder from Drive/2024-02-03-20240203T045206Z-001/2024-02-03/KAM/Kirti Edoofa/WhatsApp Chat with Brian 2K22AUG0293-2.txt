29/12/23, 7:28 AM - Piiyush Edoofa added you
12/1/24, 5:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Brian,

I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
12/1/24, 5:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
12/1/24, 5:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
12/1/24, 6:02 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: Happy new year. We are all doing fine
12/1/24, 6:02 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: Thank you
12/1/24, 7:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your wishes. I am glad to hear that. With great excitement and pride, I also want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
12/1/24, 7:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
12/1/24, 7:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we discuss your admission journey further, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

12/1/24, 7:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/1/24, 1:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond, since it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect on Monday to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation Monday.
13/1/24, 1:19 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: I did go through the posts and just appreciated by reacting to the post.
13/1/24, 1:19 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: Nice weekend
25/1/24, 11:53 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Brian,

I hope this message finds you all well and in high spirits. I apologize for not being in touch over the past few days. Unfortunately, I was dealing with a significant ENT infection and needed to follow my doctor's recommendation for rest, which meant taking some time off to prioritize my health. As a result, I was unable to inform you about my temporary absence. Thankfully, I'm feeling considerably better now and am ready to resume our interactions. Before we proceed with our discussion, I'd like to catch up - how have you and your family been lately?
25/1/24, 11:56 AM - +265 888 50 55 06: Sorry that you've been unwell but great that you are feeling better now.  We are doing well here.  Thanks.
25/1/24, 12:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are doing well and thank you for the concern. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
25/1/24, 12:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your MSCE results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
25/1/24, 1:34 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 1:35 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: Those are all A grades showing he is capable of doing almost any course.  But wants Civil Engineering
25/1/24, 1:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
25/1/24, 1:47 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: Thank you
25/1/24, 1:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course B.Tech (Civil Engineering) for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
25/1/24, 1:51 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: Yes
25/1/24, 1:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 1:52 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: Yes, I do remember.
25/1/24, 1:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
25/1/24, 2:19 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: From what I know the process of looking for a place for admission is underway.   Once a place has been secured, a letter of offer will be sent to the prospective student in our case Edoofa is also involved.
25/1/24, 2:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
25/1/24, 5:42 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: If I see need of clarification,  I will be doing that.  Thanks.
25/1/24, 6:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
25/1/24, 6:25 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: Thanks.  Just looking forward to that.
25/1/24, 6:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
25/1/24, 6:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
25/1/24, 6:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
25/1/24, 6:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
25/1/24, 7:55 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: Yes, I know it's not.  Then one is required to choose one?
25/1/24, 7:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
25/1/24, 7:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
25/1/24, 7:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
25/1/24, 8:02 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: They did.
25/1/24, 8:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
25/1/24, 8:08 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: Yes.
25/1/24, 8:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per year
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per year
Registration Fee: $750 (due within two weeks)
*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*
I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
25/1/24, 8:35 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: Yes
25/1/24, 8:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
25/1/24, 8:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
25/1/24, 8:40 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: This is noted.
25/1/24, 8:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
25/1/24, 8:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
25/1/24, 8:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
25/1/24, 9:16 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: Noted.
25/1/24, 9:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
25/1/24, 9:36 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: Understood.   Just clarification on USD750.00, this is supposed to be paid at once and full by the applicant?  When, roughly do you think there will be need to pay this amount?  According to your experience.
25/1/24, 9:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @265888505506 we would be discussing the same in the upcoming step which is step 4, however, given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
25/1/24, 9:44 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: Thank you. This is noted.
26/1/24, 11:47 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Brian.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation yesterday since we were not able to move further with our discussion may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can continue with our discussion?
26/1/24, 1:57 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: I am in office, working at the moment but free in 3 hrs time.  Good afternoon
26/1/24, 2:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @265888505506 thank you for letting me know that, in that case, may I know what time exactly will you be available to connect with us?
26/1/24, 2:42 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: Around 17 hrs
26/1/24, 3:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, let us connect at 05:00 pm today.
26/1/24, 4:00 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: Yes.
26/1/24, 5:54 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: I am home now
26/1/24, 5:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @265888505506 I am glad to know that may I know if we can connect now?
26/1/24, 6:22 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: Wanted a call?  Go ahead.  I am Ulunji Brian's father.  You can.
26/1/24, 6:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you are clear so far?
26/1/24, 6:37 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: I am but wanted clarification on this and it was promised that the conversation would continue today.
26/1/24, 6:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please we will continue with our discussion. Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
.
26/1/24, 6:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
26/1/24, 6:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 6:55 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: This is great
26/1/24, 6:55 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: Noted.
26/1/24, 6:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
26/1/24, 6:59 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: Very excited!
26/1/24, 7:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.
26/1/24, 7:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $750. 

We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
26/1/24, 7:04 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: Not aware.
26/1/24, 7:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
26/1/24, 7:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $750. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $375 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $375, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
26/1/24, 7:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 29 , 2024, and your registration fee stands at $750, you'll need to make a payment of $375 on or before January 29, 2024. The remaining $375 should be paid by February 29 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
26/1/24, 7:07 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: Following.
26/1/24, 7:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/1/24, 7:21 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: Understood.
26/1/24, 8:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
26/1/24, 8:12 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: Yes.
26/1/24, 8:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
26/1/24, 8:17 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: This is noted.  Thank you.
26/1/24, 8:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @265888505506 while I was going through your application file I noticed that we would need your JCE results as well.
26/1/24, 8:39 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: They don't give notification of results but just certificates which are not yet in.
26/1/24, 8:40 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: Should I just give results for each subject or wait for certificate?
26/1/24, 8:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @265888505506 I have the MSCE results for Brian, however, his JCE results are not with us and we would a picture of the jce results.
26/1/24, 8:41 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: I will revert on this since his certificate is not yet in.
26/1/24, 8:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @265888505506 may I know by when will you be able to update me about the same?
2/2/24, 3:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Brian,

I hope this message finds you well. Please excuse me for not connecting in the past few days, I have been currently dealing with an unexpected family emergency and have taken some time off to provide support to my loved ones during this challenging time and that is why I have not been able to get back to you, however, I will be able to connect with you now onwards.
2/2/24, 4:24 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: Good afternoon
2/2/24, 4:24 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: <Media omitted>
2/2/24, 4:25 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: Brian's former school just sent a reference letter confirming JC results.
2/2/24, 4:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the reference letter it is duly noted with us. Please even share your Identity proof with us.
2/2/24, 5:28 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: For me his dad or Ulunji Brian himself,  the prospective student?
2/2/24, 6:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @265888505506 for Brian, if he does not have an ID yet then you can share your ID as well.
2/2/24, 6:03 PM - +265 888 50 55 06: His ID is not yet out but was registered and it not yet out.  But has the ID number only. Will send mine instead.
2/2/24, 6:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely I shall wait for your response.
