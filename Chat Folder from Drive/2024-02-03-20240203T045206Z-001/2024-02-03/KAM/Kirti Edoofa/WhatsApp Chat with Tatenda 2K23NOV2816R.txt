I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.

It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.

On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?

I trust you are all well. I'm writing to follow up on the messages shared above. I noticed that you have not responded for a long time now since the international scholarship is once in a lifetime opportunity your lack of response has left a negative response on the student's application. 

Therefore, I am reaching out to you once more to inquire if you have had a chance to read my earlier message and to confirm whether we are still in communication.

Therefore, I'm reaching out today to check if you had a chance to review my previous message and to confirm if we are still in communication?
