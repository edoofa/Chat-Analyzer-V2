5/1/24, 9:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/1/24, 10:28 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Unathi,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
6/1/24, 10:28 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
6/1/24, 10:30 AM - +27 63 826 9733: Good morning ma'am thank you so much
6/1/24, 10:31 AM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
6/1/24, 10:32 AM - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
6/1/24, 10:33 AM - +27 63 826 9733: Okay ma'am
6/1/24, 10:36 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
6/1/24, 10:36 AM - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
6/1/24, 10:41 AM - +27 63 826 9733: 1. 1800USD
2. 5years
3. 300 USD
4. 750 USD
6/1/24, 10:58 AM - Kirti Edoofa: @27638269733 could you please check the first question again, and check for your tuition fee per semester after scholarship?
6/1/24, 11:03 AM - +27 63 826 9733: 900 USD
6/1/24, 11:10 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a five-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 10 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
6/1/24, 11:16 AM - +27 63 826 9733: Yes ma'am
6/1/24, 11:23 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
6/1/24, 11:23 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
6/1/24, 11:23 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
6/1/24, 11:29 AM - +27 63 826 9733: Okay ma'am
6/1/24, 11:29 AM - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
6/1/24, 11:30 AM - +27 63 826 9733: Yes
6/1/24, 11:32 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
6/1/24, 11:35 AM - +27 63 826 9733: Yes I am
6/1/24, 11:42 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
6/1/24, 11:42 AM - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on January 20th 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
6/1/24, 11:47 AM - +27 63 826 9733: Yes ma'am
6/1/24, 11:52 AM - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
6/1/24, 11:53 AM - +27 63 826 9733: Yes please
6/1/24, 12:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $650 of the registration fee. This $650 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$325 before the first deadline date of January 20th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$325 before the second deadline date of February 20th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date). <This message was edited>
6/1/24, 12:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $650 within 15 working days, before January 20th 2024. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
6/1/24, 12:07 PM - +27 63 826 9733: Okay ma'am
6/1/24, 12:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
6/1/24, 12:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
6/1/24, 12:09 PM - +27 63 826 9733: Not really I'm residing in Bulawayo
6/1/24, 12:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
6/1/24, 12:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
6/1/24, 12:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
6/1/24, 12:11 PM - +27 63 826 9733: Thank you
6/1/24, 12:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
6/1/24, 12:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mama Money for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option.
6/1/24, 12:26 PM - +27 63 826 9733: Okay ma'am
6/1/24, 12:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
6/1/24, 12:28 PM - +27 63 826 9733: Okay ma'am
6/1/24, 12:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
6/1/24, 12:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
6/1/24, 12:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
6/1/24, 12:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
6/1/24, 12:32 PM - +27 63 826 9733: Okay ma'am
6/1/24, 12:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
6/1/24, 12:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
6/1/24, 12:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
6/1/24, 12:57 PM - +27 63 826 9733: Yes ma'am
6/1/24, 12:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
6/1/24, 12:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
6/1/24, 12:58 PM - +27 63 826 9733: No ma'am l don't have
6/1/24, 12:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
6/1/24, 12:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Galgotias University, situated in Delhi NCR, boasts an impressive academic reputation, ranking among the top 100 universities in India. One of its notable achievements is obtaining NAAC A+ Accreditation in the First Cycle, setting the highest standard for academic excellence.

A significant factor contributing to Galgotias University's consistent recognition as a top institution is its 'students-first' philosophy. This approach prioritizes the well-being and success of its students and aligns with Edoofa's values and mission.

One of the university's standout features is its dedication to maintaining a low student-to-faculty ratio. This approach ensures that students receive ample personal attention and mentoring, fostering a supportive and nurturing learning environment.

Here, you'll find information about the accreditations and approvals granted by the Government of India, which reflect the university's commitment to meeting national educational standards.

6/1/24, 1:25 PM - +27 63 826 9733: Okay ma'am
6/1/24, 1:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
6/1/24, 1:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
6/1/24, 1:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on Monday 06:00 pm. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
6/1/24, 1:29 PM - +27 63 826 9733: Yes ma'am thank you
6/1/24, 1:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, have a blessed day and weekend ahead, and do convey my regards to your family as well.
8/1/24, 6:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Unathi!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by the University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from the University as a collective?
8/1/24, 8:08 PM - +27 63 826 9733: Good evening ma'am sorry we were busy with something
8/1/24, 8:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright please, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
8/1/24, 8:22 PM - +27 63 826 9733: Yes sure ma'am
8/1/24, 8:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from the University as a collective?
8/1/24, 8:37 PM - +27 63 826 9733: Yes ma'am we did
8/1/24, 8:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
8/1/24, 8:39 PM - +27 63 826 9733: Same here ma'am we are hoping everything will go well it's just that now we are experiencing a financial crisis and the registration fee is needed in 15days time so hopefully we will have money by then 😔
8/1/24, 8:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I can understand that completely, and we will discuss that in detail. 

Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further? <This message was edited>

Rest assured, as promised, I am here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. 

Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
8/1/24, 8:48 PM - +27 63 826 9733: Not yet ma'am
8/1/24, 9:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That's fantastic to hear! Moving forward, I would like to discuss your plans for securing your scholarship seat so that we can communicate them with the university. 

As the university has set a deadline of January 20, 2024, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $325, or you can opt to pay the full $325 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you?
8/1/24, 9:25 PM - +27 63 826 9733: My parents are trying hard to get the $325 hopefully they will get it by then the problem is my young sister is also in school so they are also trying hard to pay for her school fees
8/1/24, 9:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of this. In addition to this, it would be great if you could kindly provide me with the specific date you have in mind for the payment and the mode of payment that you are planning to use so that I can share those as well with the university. Hence, could you share these with me?
8/1/24, 9:38 PM - +27 63 826 9733: Hopefully by the 20th we will have money ma'am and we are in South Africa
8/1/24, 9:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, I have taken note of these details and I will update the university officials accordingly. 

As you navigate through your admission journey, please remember that if you encounter any challenges or have any concerns that could potentially hinder your progress, do not hesitate to reach out to me here. I trust that you will keep this in mind and feel comfortable reaching out when needed, right?
8/1/24, 10:01 PM - +27 63 826 9733: Yes ma'am
8/1/24, 10:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I appreciate you for keeping me informed. I will also ensure that the university officials are updated on our progress.

With your sessions now completed, and the offer letter in your possession, your next important step is to ensure the payment of your university registration fee within the shared deadline to secure your scholarship seat.
8/1/24, 10:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you have made the payment, please share the receipt with me here.

8/1/24, 10:13 PM - +27 63 826 9733: Thank you ma'am
24/1/24, 12:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Unathi,

I trust you're all having a good day. I want to start by apologizing for my absence over the past week. Unfortunately, I was unwell with a severe ENT infection, which required me to rest as per my doctor's advice. Thankfully, I'm feeling much improved now and am eager to reconnect with you so we can continue our discussions.
24/1/24, 12:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As I was organizing my day I recall our previous conversation and I've been awaiting a response from you but haven't received an update yet. I wanted to reach out again to check on the status of the payment, as your deadline was on the 20th and you shared that you will be making the deposit on the same day. It's important for us to provide an update to the university officials accordingly.

Could you please let me know if you were able to complete the payment? Your response would be greatly appreciated as it will help us stay on track with the university's requirements?
24/1/24, 12:35 PM - +27 63 826 9733: Greetings ma'am thank God you are now feeling better
24/1/24, 12:35 PM - +27 63 826 9733: About the payment my parents failed to raise the money needed
24/1/24, 4:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your concern. May I know what happened, due to which you were not able to make the first installment of your registration fee?
24/1/24, 6:50 PM - +27 63 826 9733: They were not able to arrange it
26/1/24, 12:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Unathi.

1/2/24, 8:19 PM - +27 63 826 9733: Okay ma'am my younger sister is in a new grade now so there was a lot of money that was needed for her and my mom she started work not so long ago but in the middle of January so the pay she got is not so good enough and my dad being a security guard he is not also getting much of a payment <This message was edited>
1/2/24, 8:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Based on the insights you have provided, I now have a clearer understanding. While the university's due dates are significant for securing the scholarship seat, I acknowledge the validity of your concerns and as promised, I am here to help you with the same.
1/2/24, 8:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: if you do not mind me asking could you please help me understand when your mother paid is it the start or end of the month?
1/2/24, 8:32 PM - +27 63 826 9733: End of month
1/2/24, 8:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that. If you do not think it is too much to ask could you please help me understand how much your parents get paid, I understand that it can be a personal question so if you wish to respond to the same over the personal window you can do that?
1/2/24, 8:36 PM - +27 63 826 9733: Umm okay ma'am
1/2/24, 8:40 PM - +27 63 826 9733: My mom gets R2000 a month

I hope you are doing well. Since we were not able to continue with our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
2/2/24, 7:35 PM - +27 63 826 9733: Good evening ma'am
2/2/24, 7:35 PM - +27 63 826 9733: My dad gets R4000 a month
2/2/24, 7:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, so if my understanding is correct both your parents' salaries combine to a total of 6000 rands which is almost $317 a month?
2/2/24, 8:32 PM - +27 63 826 9733: Yes ma'am
2/2/24, 8:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Considering you've brought this concern to our attention. I believe we can discuss the matter with university officials to explore a solution that prevents you from missing out on this valuable scholarship opportunity. This scholarship serves as the initial stepping stone for your to access higher-quality education and pave the way for a successful career.
2/2/24, 8:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To assist you effectively, I would appreciate a more detailed understanding of your situation. This will enable us to align your needs with the university's policies and find a suitable solution. For me to understand your situation better here, I would like to understand how much have you raised so far and will be able to raise till the 15th of February?
2/2/24, 8:52 PM - +27 63 826 9733: To be honest ma'am I don't know how much is saved because the money my parents get they use it to pay rent every month end and my younger sister also needs around R2000 for her schooling then food stuff and all so my situation is bad at the moment ma'am 😩
2/2/24, 8:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @27638269733 I completely understand what you are trying to say, however, unless and until you help me with how much have you raise so far I will not be able to assist you with a flexible payment plan.
