28/12/23, 4:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Leroy.

I hope this message reaches you in good health. *I am Ms. Kirti, the Admission Officer at Edoofa*. Please excuse Mr. Shivjeet for his unavailability this week, as he is engaged in meetings with university officials. In the meantime, I am here to assist you with any concerns or questions you may have.
28/12/23, 4:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: First of all. Thank you for sharing the payment receipt for your university registration fee, we have duly noted it. Our accounts team is currently processing the same receipts for payment confirmation.

Once the payment is verified, we will update your scholarship application accordingly. Additionally, we will notify the university authorities about the payment for their records to ensure a smooth visa process.
28/12/23, 4:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your kind and thoughtful message. It's heartening to hear about your positive view of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and your appreciation for the efforts we made to accommodate your educational aspirations. I understand that deciding not to continue with your plans to study in India or elsewhere is a significant decision, and it must not have been easy for you. Please know that your decision is respected. However, for us to have clarity could you please help me understand the sudden change in your plans, maybe this will help me understand you better?
29/12/23, 7:41 PM - +263 71 422 2943: My pleasure ma'am. I plan to venture into business here in Zimbabwe without including higher education. Of course higher education in a prestigious country like India is of great value, though pursuing in business is heartfelt and right for me. I nolonger want the program l have chosen. All this will help in my favor and my parents' too since money is being a difficulty to them. Hence, l can lessen their burden through this plan which will also be part of my long term goals.

4/1/24, 4:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Leroy.

I hope you are doing well and had a delightful New Year celebration. 
Thank you for sharing your thoughts and plans. It's clear that you've given considerable thought to your decision to venture into business in Zimbabwe, prioritizing it over higher education at this time. Your choice to follow a path that feels right and heartfelt to you is commendable.
4/1/24, 4:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, I'm curious to know more about how you envision this business venture contributing to your career development. How do you see this step fitting into your overall career aspirations? Do you have specific business ideas or sectors you are passionate about?
5/1/24, 5:54 AM - +263 71 422 2943: Greetings!!
The business does not contribute to the career l once wanted to pursue in. It was something in me though l wanted to go through higher education first but after considering the financial status at home and also the years l would have been in university against what l can achieve if only l have the capital to venture into this business in those three years it would be meaningful to me. Of course l have specific business ideas that l am passionate about and with God's grace they can be achieved without going for higher education.
5/1/24, 1:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Leroy.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing that with me. Certainly, Leroy, I completely comprehend that under the given circumstances, you might naturally lean toward the decision to withdraw from the scholarship. If this is the choice you've made, I fully respect your decision. However, there's still a question that is unanswered regarding the initial reasons behind your enrollment. When your parents enrolled you, they undoubtedly had specific aspirations or reasons in mind. If it's not too much to ask, could you kindly share with me what initially motivated you to pursue higher education in India?
6/1/24, 7:53 AM - +263 71 422 2943: Greetings!!
Growing up I always wanted to study abroad for my higher education but did not think that it would actually come true. Therefore, when l came to know about Edoofa, I fell in love with India because its educational system is highly recommended as proven by many world reknowned people it has produced. Also, I knew India as the third richest country globally, having Edoofa providing employability and psychology being one of the finest jobs in India( which l wanted to pursue in), learning there was very significant. Lastly, l have always loved India for its culture so learning there would have been such a wonderful and remarkable experience.
10/1/24, 3:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Leroy.

I hope you are doing well, kindly excuse me for not connecting earlier as I was a little under the weather. It's truly inspiring to hear about your aspirations and how you've nurtured the dream of studying abroad, particularly in India with us. In that case, I would like to understand that now that you have an opportunity why do you not wish to move ahead with the same, keeping aside the financial concerns I want to understand what other challenges are you facing?
10/1/24, 9:42 PM - +263 71 422 2943: We are okay ma'am thank you. There are no other challenges ma'am it is just that l no longer want to go for my higher education instead l want to venture into business as soon as l get capital.
16/1/24, 12:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Proud Edoofians,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 2:09 PM - +263 71 422 2943: Thank you mam for sharing with us the activities of rhe admin in concern  with the enroling of new students
16/1/24, 2:15 PM - +263 71 422 2943: As for Leroy as he shared earlier on he is no longer proceeding with the scholarship.
As his parents we have approached the Admin on how we can get the refund of the money we paid through Mr Shorwi of Hartzel High School  Mutare Zimbabwe.
As for now our plea is if you could help get our refund we would be very grateful.
We are looking forward to hear from you soon.
Leroy and parents
26/1/24, 12:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Leroy,

I hope this message finds you all well and in high spirits. I apologize for not being in touch over the past few days. Unfortunately, I was dealing with a significant ENT infection and needed to follow my doctor's recommendation for rest, which meant taking some time off to prioritize my health. As a result, I was unable to inform you about my temporary absence. Thankfully, I'm feeling considerably better now.
26/1/24, 12:35 PM - +263 71 422 2943: Greetings mam. This is Leroy's mother.Am really sorry for what you has been through, but am glad to hear that you are now feeling much better 
Please get well soon

26/1/24, 12:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: On the auspicious occasion of Republic Day, I extend my heartfelt greetings to you and your loved ones. Today marks a significant moment in our nation's history, a day when we commemorate the enactment of our Constitution and celebrate the enduring spirit of democracy and unity that defines us as a country.
26/1/24, 12:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 2:32 PM - +263 71 422 2943: Thank you mam.Then Leroy had sent you a message saying he has withdrawn from the program and we are requesting our refund.
Please kindly assist us on this issue so that we can get our refund.
We are really in need of the money
1/2/24, 9:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Leroy

I hope this message finds you well. Please excuse me for not connecting in the past few days, I have been currently dealing with an unexpected family emergency and have taken some time off to provide support to my loved ones during this challenging time and that is why I have not been able to get back to you, however, given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
2/2/24, 4:38 PM - +263 71 422 2943: Good afternoon mam
