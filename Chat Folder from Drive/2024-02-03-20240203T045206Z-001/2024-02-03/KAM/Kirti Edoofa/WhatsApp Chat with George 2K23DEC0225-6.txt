Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
6/1/24, 10:29 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
6/1/24, 10:30 AM - +263 77 756 4664: Yes we went through it
6/1/24, 10:30 AM - +263 77 756 4664: Thank you
6/1/24, 10:32 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
6/1/24, 10:32 AM - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
6/1/24, 10:33 AM - +263 77 756 4664: Yes you can
6/1/24, 10:36 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
6/1/24, 10:36 AM - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
6/1/24, 10:44 AM - +263 77 756 4664: 1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship: 350
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship:0
3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship:4325
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable):125
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat:1000
All prices in dollars
6/1/24, 10:51 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 90% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout the course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
6/1/24, 10:52 AM - +263 77 756 4664: Yes yes
6/1/24, 10:54 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
6/1/24, 10:55 AM - Kirti Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1600 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1850.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1600. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
6/1/24, 10:56 AM - +263 77 756 4664: Yes very well
6/1/24, 10:59 AM - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
6/1/24, 11:00 AM - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
6/1/24, 11:01 AM - +263 77 756 4664: Yes
6/1/24, 11:02 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
6/1/24, 11:02 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make his/her education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
6/1/24, 11:03 AM - +263 77 756 4664: Yes l have understood well
6/1/24, 11:11 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1850, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education. <This message was edited>
6/1/24, 11:11 AM - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
6/1/24, 11:12 AM - +263 77 756 4664: Yes very clear
6/1/24, 11:16 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
6/1/24, 11:17 AM - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his/her annual fee, which is $1600. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1600 - $1000 = $600, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
6/1/24, 11:17 AM - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
6/1/24, 11:18 AM - +263 77 756 4664: Yes yes
6/1/24, 11:25 AM - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
6/1/24, 11:26 AM - Kirti Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1850 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $850 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
6/1/24, 11:26 AM - +263 77 756 4664: Yes l have already started with program
6/1/24, 11:29 AM - +263 77 756 4664: Yes yes noted
6/1/24, 11:30 AM - +263 77 756 4664: So l don't need to pay the admission fee but it will be part of the fees
6/1/24, 11:31 AM - Kirti Edoofa: @263777564664 let me help you understand you are required to pay the registration fee inorder for you to reserve your seat with the university. This registration fee is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first-year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
6/1/24, 11:33 AM - +263 77 756 4664: Yes yes noted
6/1/24, 11:44 AM - Kirti Edoofa: In continuation of our discussion, I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for your is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that you will find a more affordable and high-quality education. 

Certainly, there are other universities that may assess your scholarship qualifications, and with those, the cost of education may fall within the specified range I mentioned earlier.
6/1/24, 11:44 AM - Kirti Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $850 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?
6/1/24, 11:44 AM - Kirti Edoofa: It's essential to consider the big picture and the overall financial benefits that come with the scholarship offer you have received. Do you not agree with this?
6/1/24, 11:47 AM - +263 77 756 4664: I would like one with less registration fee
6/1/24, 11:47 AM - +263 77 756 4664: No l didn't want to accept this offer l wanted to wait for another responses
6/1/24, 11:48 AM - +263 77 756 4664: Just to open up as per my passion was to try and get an offer letter from Lovely professional university
6/1/24, 3:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concerns I have taken a note of all your queries and I would love to continue with our discussion, since it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect on Monday to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation monday.
9/1/24, 12:18 PM - +263 77 756 4664: Good afternoon
9/1/24, 2:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I would love to continue with our discussions however, I regret to inform you that I'm currently not feeling well. As a result, I just came to inform you that I would like to reschedule our discussion for tomorrow. I hope this works for you and that you'll be available to connect tomorrow. Thank you for your understanding.
9/1/24, 2:41 PM - +263 77 756 4664: Yes l will connect with you
10/1/24, 12:48 PM - +263 77 756 4664: Hello
10/1/24, 2:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and George.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation previously, I wanted to schedule our discussion for today at 06:00 pm so that we can have a complete discussion about the concerns that you have shared as well in detail.
10/1/24, 2:48 PM - +263 77 756 4664: Okay l will be there
10/1/24, 6:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
10/1/24, 6:14 PM - +263 77 756 4664: Yes
10/1/24, 6:18 PM - +263 77 756 4664: Good evening
10/1/24, 7:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if you are available to continue with our discussion?
10/1/24, 7:28 PM - +263 77 756 4664: Yes
10/1/24, 7:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
10/1/24, 7:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
10/1/24, 7:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
10/1/24, 7:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the MVN and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
10/1/24, 7:41 PM - +263 77 756 4664: Yes this is clear
10/1/24, 7:41 PM - +263 77 756 4664: And as l mentioned the University l had in mind was Lovely Professional University
10/1/24, 7:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: At the same time, since it is an associated university with Edoofa, we have already shared your application with Lovely Professional University for a scholarship application and we are currently waiting for an update from them. 

As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by MVN, you would lose out on the scholarship from MVN and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
10/1/24, 7:43 PM - +263 77 756 4664: No l'm not aware of it
10/1/24, 7:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with MVN by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at MVN without risking losing out on the scholarship.
10/1/24, 7:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $1000 to MVN to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $1000.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $1000, but because you would have already paid $1000 for MVN, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $1000 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
10/1/24, 7:46 PM - +263 77 756 4664: Yes
10/1/24, 7:54 PM - +263 77 756 4664: I understand
10/1/24, 7:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now coming back to your question. Let me tell you that both universities are very well, and it is true that LPU is the best, however, this event brings us to the concern shared by the counseling team we were informed of your desire to get a high quantum of scholarship. If you do not wish to move ahead with MVN, we do not have a problem with it we appreciate your decision, but please understand the universities where we have shared your application will not be offering you such a high quantum of scholarship. If that is not a concern for you, and the cost is not a problem then we can surely wait for the responses of the other universities, however, if you miss your chance here you will not be able to transfer back to this university since you would already miss your opportunity.
10/1/24, 7:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: So before jumping on to decisions, I would encourage you to think twice before making any decisions that you might regret in the future, being your admission officer, I would not suggest this, and I think there is no harm in understanding the letter and discussing it, even if you reserve your seat you do have the transfer option available so it is a win-win situation for you, keeping two options handly and finally decide what you wish at the end, so please think about it first before making any decision.
10/1/24, 7:58 PM - +263 77 756 4664: Okay l will think about it critically
10/1/24, 8:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, so may I know if you are comfortable to complete the letter discussion so that you have a better understanding of the offer letter?
10/1/24, 8:12 PM - +263 77 756 4664: Yes we can complete it
10/1/24, 8:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: So may I know if you are clear so far and agree with the same?
10/1/24, 8:15 PM - +263 77 756 4664: Pardon you mean to agree and accept the MVN offer?
10/1/24, 8:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263777564664 may I know if you go through the message that I tagged above please?
10/1/24, 8:21 PM - +263 77 756 4664: Yes l did
10/1/24, 8:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: So I just wanted to know if you agree to the fact that it is essential to consider the bigger picture as well and the overall financial benefits that come with the scholarship offer you have received?
10/1/24, 8:23 PM - +263 77 756 4664: Yes sorry l did agree with that
10/1/24, 8:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to see we share the same perspective. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1,850. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you  arrive in India will be $1,850 - $1,000 = $850 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India.

I hope you are clear about this as well?
10/1/24, 8:25 PM - +263 77 756 4664: Yes
10/1/24, 8:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as January 20, 2024*.
10/1/24, 8:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
10/1/24, 8:31 PM - +263 77 756 4664: Yes very well
10/1/24, 8:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $900 of the registration fee. This $900 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $450 before the first deadline date of *January 20, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $450 before the second deadline date of *February 20, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
10/1/24, 8:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $900 within 15 working days, before January 20, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
10/1/24, 8:33 PM - +263 77 756 4664: Yes we are
10/1/24, 8:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
10/1/24, 8:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
10/1/24, 8:36 PM - +263 77 756 4664: No l'm not in Harare
10/1/24, 8:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In that case, may I know where you reside, please?
10/1/24, 8:37 PM - +263 77 756 4664: I'm in Mount Darwin
10/1/24, 8:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
10/1/24, 8:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare.

10/1/24, 9:14 PM - +263 77 756 4664: These are amazing
10/1/24, 9:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasize the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.

10/1/24, 9:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on Saturday which is 13th Jan at 10:00 am. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
10/1/24, 9:17 PM - +263 77 756 4664: Yes thank you so much
13/1/24, 10:18 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and George!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by MVN University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from MVN University as a collective?
13/1/24, 10:28 AM - +263 77 756 4664: Yes
13/1/24, 10:28 AM - +263 77 756 4664: Good morning
13/1/24, 10:50 AM - Kirti Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
13/1/24, 10:53 AM - +263 77 756 4664: Okay they wanted me just settle the sit but currently they cannot pay the registration fee and meet the deadline for MVN university
13/1/24, 10:54 AM - +263 77 756 4664: But they wanted me to change the University if l get another offer letter from another University
13/1/24, 10:56 AM - +263 77 756 4664: Also l would like to let you know that my A level results are out
13/1/24, 12:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand however, as we discussed yesterday I hope you are aware about the transfer option?
13/1/24, 12:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand since your results came out yesterday only the re-evaluation will not be possible right now as it takes time since the university has already offered you a scholarship, considering that you have the endowment benefits right which is the $100 grant if you tend to wait for re-evaluation and continue to move forward with the standard admission process you will end up losing the endowment benefits. So my advice regarding your admission offer is to understand the letter better now because I will never want you to miss out on the endowment benefit.
13/1/24, 12:33 PM - +263 77 756 4664: Yes l know
13/1/24, 12:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I would love to continue with our discussions however, I regret to inform you that I'm currently not feeling well. As a result, I just came to inform you that I would like to reschedule our discussion for Monday. I hope this works for you and that you'll be available to connect on Monday. Thank you for your understanding.
13/1/24, 12:41 PM - +263 77 756 4664: Okay thank you.l understand about the endowment benefits but my parents due to financial imbalance cannot pay the registration fee so they said l can miss the benefits and also they decided for me to wait for another University.Thank you
13/1/24, 12:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263777564664 let us discuss your challenge in detail on Monday so that I will be able to assist you even better with your challenges.
13/1/24, 9:01 PM - +263 77 756 4664: <Media omitted>
15/1/24, 8:41 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and George.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I'm sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will promptly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
15/1/24, 8:45 AM - +263 77 756 4664: Good morning thank you  too
15/1/24, 12:17 PM - +263 77 756 4664: Afternoon
15/1/24, 12:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, George with regard to our conversation previously may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can continue with our discussion?
15/1/24, 1:01 PM - +263 77 756 4664: Yes l am
15/1/24, 1:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, now with regard to our last discussion you mentioned that due to some financial concerns, your parents can not pay the registration fee and because of which you are ready to miss on the endowment benefits, so for me to assist you I would need to understand your situation better, could you please help me understand your challenges better?
15/1/24, 1:06 PM - +263 77 756 4664: Okay my daddy is a teacher and he get a very low salary and l come from a very poor family that was the main reason l applied for help from Edoofa now if he is supposed to pay the $1000 he can not pay it at once but maybe in parts so my main issue is money
15/1/24, 1:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263777564664 Thank you for letting me know that I completely understand that however, with the endowment grant of $100, you have been allowed to pay in two installments as well, may I know if you considered that as well?
15/1/24, 1:13 PM - +263 77 756 4664: Yes we did but for now we can't pay for the $450
15/1/24, 1:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your situation with me. I can understand that. Additionally, I want to inform you regarding the deadline, @263777564664 if a student misses the university's specified due date, they may lose the opportunity, making it crucial to adhere to the deadline.
15/1/24, 1:16 PM - +263 77 756 4664: Okay l understand
15/1/24, 1:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Considering you've brought this concern to our attention in a timely manner, I believe we can discuss the matter with university officials to explore a solution that prevents you from missing out on this valuable scholarship opportunity. This scholarship serves as the initial stepping stone for you to access higher-quality education and pave the way for a successful career.
15/1/24, 1:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To assist you effectively, I would appreciate a more detailed understanding of your situation. This will enable us to align your needs with the university's policies and find a suitable solution. In order for me to understand your situation better here, I would like to understand how much have you raise so far and will be able to raise till the 20th of January?
15/1/24, 1:16 PM - +263 77 756 4664: Okay thank you
15/1/24, 1:17 PM - +263 77 756 4664: As per now today it's 15 and he hasn't been able to find any funds for the Fee
15/1/24, 1:19 PM - +263 77 756 4664: And the other main  issue was  he did not want me to settle a sit at MVN university even l understand the transfer program that you explained
15/1/24, 1:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I understand your concern here, may I know if you explained the transfer option to your father as well?
15/1/24, 1:20 PM - +263 77 756 4664: Yes l did
15/1/24, 1:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Could you please help me understand what were his thoughts about the same?
15/1/24, 1:22 PM - +263 77 756 4664: He said it was a good option but because he doesn't even have any money at the moment he will wait for another offer letter
15/1/24, 1:23 PM - +263 77 756 4664: And we are also on the same page he wants me to proceed with Lovely professional university
15/1/24, 2:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. If you have made up your mind, we respect your decision. However, as your admission officer, I am keen to understand the reasons behind your decision to change the offered university (MVN). If you believe that MVN University is not the right fit and you wish to explore other options, I would appreciate insights into the specific reasons. MVN University was recommended to you after careful evaluation, and if it doesn't meet your expectations, understanding your concerns will help us provide feedback to the university and assist you in making the right decision for your education.
15/1/24, 2:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that, I understand that you are waiting for updates from other universities, however, I wanted to know what happens if you receive the offer letter from another university and it is not up to the mark as you thought or if the cost of education is not as what you had in mind, in that case, I would like to know what are your plans since you will also lose your opportunity from MVN university as well?
15/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 77 756 4664: I'm not sure about that but l just hoped that l get the offer letter from my desired university.Thank you
15/1/24, 2:09 PM - +263 77 756 4664: From my research l found out that the MVN university isn't a very recognized university and not well ranked that's why l lost interest in it
15/1/24, 2:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely if you wish to have a letter from Lovely Professional University you do not have to worry about that, we have already shared your application there. Once we receive any updates we shall notify you.
15/1/24, 2:16 PM - +263 77 756 4664: Okay thank you
15/1/24, 2:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Could you please help me understand what is the major concern may I know if you are worried about the quality of the university here?
15/1/24, 2:17 PM - +263 77 756 4664: Yes the quality of the University and a lot of friends in lndia advised me that it wasn't a good option for me
15/1/24, 2:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, I completely understand where you are coming from, if I had been at your place I would also believe what my friends or the internet suggest. However, being Indians, we have been in the education industry for 15+ years now we are not only connected with Ministries in Zimbabwe but are also connected with the ones in India, and hence the university recommendations we get, are approved and directed from them. With this, you can rest assured that the quality of the university would be up to the mark and would be the right fit for you.

Also if you do not mind me asking could you help me understand which friends of your shared the same?
15/1/24, 2:23 PM - +263 77 756 4664: Okay l can't disclose the names of the friends as they didn't want me to do so
15/1/24, 9:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, kindly excuse me I was occupied with a meeting today and hence I could not move ahead with the discussion with you.

26/1/24, 12:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 1:30 PM - +263 77 756 4664: Good afternoon
26/1/24, 1:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if you are ready to start with our discussion?
26/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 77 756 4664: Yes
26/1/24, 1:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, now coming back to your concern again that you shared earlier, I understand that you can't disclose the names of your friends and I respect that as well, however, considering as per the counseling team your application suggested a higher quantum of scholarship and since we have been in the education industry for 15+ years now we are not only connected with Ministries in Zimbabwe but are also connected with the ones in India, and hence the university recommendations we get, are approved and directed from them so I would like to understand what particular factor made you question about the quality of the university here?
26/1/24, 1:44 PM - +263 77 756 4664: I went on social media platforms and so that the University is not well recognized.
26/1/24, 1:46 PM - +263 77 756 4664: I also had another serious issue l wanted to share with you,if you can assist me
26/1/24, 1:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for expressing your concerns, I completely understand the importance of choosing the right university for your education, and I appreciate the effort you have put into researching MVN University.

Your commitment to ensuring a good university for yourself is commendable. Hence, I would like to address your concerns and offer some guidance. I am sure you must be aware that there are different ranking bodies in India and when you research university rankings and reviews, it's crucial to consider reliable sources such as official university websites, reputable education portals, and recognized ranking platforms.
26/1/24, 1:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: While online reviews provide insights, they might not always represent the complete picture. University rankings can vary based on the criteria considered, and some universities might excel in specific departments or programs.

To provide you with accurate information, MVN University is one of the leading universities in the Delhi NCR, which is the capital of India, and was recommended for you after careful consideration. Hence, I am not sure about the places you have looked for, but if I am correct, it seems as if you were exploring the wrong place, and thus these concerns were highlighted.
26/1/24, 1:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely please share, I am more than willing to assist?
26/1/24, 1:56 PM - +263 77 756 4664: Okay considering my application to the Edoofa scholarship program it was before results publication and l chose to do Medical laboratory technology because l thought l would not pass to the extent of doing the course l am very passionate about that was Pharmacy and after results publication l scored points that allow me to do Pharmacy but l talked to my counselor and she said for me to do Pharmacy l must have physics in lndia,as l looked deep into it in Zimbabwe l am able to do Pharmacy,l don't know how you can assist me in order for me not to ruin my career path and passion.l am looking forward to a positive help from you.Thank you
26/1/24, 2:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263777564664 thank you for sharing this with me transparently. I completely understand where you as a student are coming from however, there are certain times when we as students forget to look at the bigger picture and focus on the small opportunities we get and then later on regret those decisions.
26/1/24, 2:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For once even if you consider pursuing a Pharmacy degree in Zimbabwe, I would like to understand considering the economy there what career opportunities will you be having? what you are doing right now is comparing the education system of two countries India's education system is 10 times ahead of Zimbabwe and it is known the best for the medical. With the affordable education you also get an international degree recognition alongside the EWYL program that specifically focuses on skill development and making students employable ready. I hope you are able to understand now?
26/1/24, 2:21 PM - +263 77 756 4664: I understand you well and it was a very great opportunity for me to persue my degree in lndia but as for me and my family my passion is more important than doing something l will regret for life because my heart beats for Pharmacy
26/1/24, 2:42 PM - +263 77 756 4664: I wanted this Edoofa program so much but it's now not inline with my career path and passion so please assist me.

26/1/24, 4:58 PM - +263 77 756 4664: Hello
26/1/24, 5:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263777564664 by the statement above it seems you are confused between passion and career and for me to provide you with better clarity I would like to understand what exactly is your career aspiration as per the counseling session and the discussion you had with your counselor I believe your career aspiration was to be in medical field may I know if my understanding is correct here?
26/1/24, 5:39 PM - +263 77 756 4664: Yes it's correct
26/1/24, 5:40 PM - +263 77 756 4664: Under medical field l wanted to do Pharmacy.
26/1/24, 5:46 PM - +263 77 756 4664: I understand with the Zimbabwean economy and me coming from a poor family lndia was the best option for me but the Medical laboratory technology program is not what l am passionate about.
26/1/24, 5:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that George, now let me help you explain how MLT is the right choice for you to make your career in the medical field. First of all, to understand better I would want you to ask this question to yourself, do you just want to pursue Pharmacy because you are passionate about it or do you wish to pursue something that will leave an impact afterwards and open career opportunities for you in the Medical filed. Do you want long-term happiness and stability or short-term satisfaction in just pursuing what you are interested in?
26/1/24, 5:53 PM - +263 77 756 4664: I want to go for pharmacy because l know it has many business opportunities after the course and doing something l am not passionate about would end me regreting my whole life
26/1/24, 5:54 PM - +263 77 756 4664: And this is something l and my family have discussed and concluded that pharmacy was the best option for me so if you assist me and help me follow my dreams
26/1/24, 5:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, understandable George may I know what plans and business opportunities you think you have after pursuing Pharmacy as a course maybe understanding your plans will help me have better clarity?
26/1/24, 5:59 PM - +263 77 756 4664: I wish to work in a pharmacy for experience for 2 years and then open my own pharmacy after that
26/1/24, 6:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263777564664 Thank you for letting me know, may I know what requirements are needed for you to open a Pharmacy shop?
26/1/24, 6:19 PM - +263 77 756 4664: I have not dug deep into that yet but the capital is way too lesser than opening a medical laboratory
26/1/24, 6:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright please, let me help you understand. To set up a pharmacy, you need to obtain a drug license from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) or your state government.

If you are starting a general chemist store, you should get a retail drug license.
If you want to set up a wholesale pharmacy business, get a wholesale drug license.
26/1/24, 6:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: These requirements are for both a person who has a degree in Pharmacy and a person who wants to start a Pharmacy business without a degree in the same field as well. What I want you to understand George is that I am not against your Passion however, I am here to guide you in your career as well. If I did not care enough about your career I would have stopped the conversation there itself where I informed you that you are not eligible however, we here aim that make our students' careers as well.
26/1/24, 6:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Of course, as a student, you will want to pursue your passion and nobody is stopping you from doing that, however, Pharmacy has a limited career opportunity in Zimbabwe so even if you study the same degree or not you will be able to open your own shop, however, if you pursue your qualification in MLT you have a broader career opportunity. My question is why do you wish to limit your career opportunities to just one when you can have 10?
26/1/24, 6:37 PM - +263 77 756 4664: For this one l think l will do so and follow my dreams.
26/1/24, 6:45 PM - +263 77 756 4664: So for where l am now l don't know how Edoofa can assist me.
26/1/24, 7:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263777564664 Nobody here is stopping you from following your dreams in fact I am trying to say here that you can still achieve them even with MLT, however, maybe you need some time to have a thorough discussion about the same we are here to build your career only. You know today is a national holiday I am here to have a discussion with you because I promised you we will have the discussion no matter what. I want you to take some time with your father and have a discussion and we can connect on Monday to have a further discussion because it is something related to your career and it is important for you to think and highlight the same with your parent as well.
26/1/24, 7:03 PM - +263 77 756 4664: Okay
26/1/24, 7:03 PM - +263 77 756 4664: Thank you
26/1/24, 7:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Have a blessed day and weekend ahead.
29/1/24, 10:03 AM - +263 77 756 4664: Good morning may l please know at what time will l have my session today
1/2/24, 2:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and George,

1/2/24, 6:35 PM - +263 77 756 4664: Hello

I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
