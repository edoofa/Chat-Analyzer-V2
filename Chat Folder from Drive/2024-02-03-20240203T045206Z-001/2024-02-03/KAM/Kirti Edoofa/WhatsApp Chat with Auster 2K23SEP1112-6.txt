As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 1:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your msce results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education.

It's incredibly challenging to cope with the passing of one loved one, let alone two in such a short span of time.

26/1/24, 8:41 PM - +265 991 40 67 78: No problem thanks

26/1/24, 9:42 PM - +265 991 40 67 78: Hello everyone on the board,

We are samala family, part of the edoofians
Our admission group name is Auster 2K23SEP1112.

Just recently this evening of 26 January 24,we had a talk with  our admission officer Ms. Kirti discussing about the final payment of the registration fee of Auster Samala.

It has been a shock to our family facing two challenges within consecutive weeks,
This misfortune is funerals, last week we lost our grand parent and just 3days ago losing also a daughter of my young brother, all these incidences happened while we had prepared to finish our registration fee of 300us dollars by 28th January 24.
Much of the funds raised to cover the registration fee had been used to help facilitating matters and activities on both occasions.
Ending to disturb our preparations.

Now this evening we were in talks with our admission officer Ms. Kirti that she should wait for us till on Friday next week on the 2 Feb 24.
We sincerely apologize for the delay. We just ask God to take us safe through this week that nothing should intervene and disturb also our preparations/budget.

Lastly we ask the board to consider and understand our concern and we promise that we will fulfil the process.

Yours faithfully.
THE SAMALA FAMILY.
