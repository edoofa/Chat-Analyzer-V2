28/12/23, 9:04 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Malcolm. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

As per the recent conversation that you had with Mr. Milan, it has been noted that you were supposed to make the payment of $200 each month. Hence, I want to take an update on you if you were able to make the payment for this month as we have already exceeded the deadline. I will be having a meeting with the university officials tomorrow and will be discussing the same with them. I do not want this delay to affect your scholarship. Hence, may I know if you might be able to share an update about the second payment if not made the payment yet? Will you be able to make it by 5:00 PM tomorrow?
29/12/23, 10:22 AM - +27 68 790 9284: Morning

16/1/24, 1:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Malcom,

I trust this message finds you well. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admission Officer at Edoofa*. I would like to inform you that Mr. Shivjeet will no longer be available, as he is advancing in his career with a new opportunity. While his departure is a loss for us, we are also filled with pride and joy for his future endeavors. Moving forward, I will be handling the next steps in your university admission journey and will be directing you in the right direction.
16/1/24, 1:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey. <This message was edited>
16/1/24, 1:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

24/1/24, 12:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Malcolm,

I trust you're all having a good day. I want to start by apologizing for my absence over the past week. Unfortunately, I was unwell with a severe ENT infection, which required me to rest as per my doctor's advice. Thankfully, I'm feeling much improved now and am eager to reconnect with you so we can continue our discussions. But before we proceed, I'm curious to hear about how your last week went? <This message was edited>

24/1/24, 4:19 PM - +27 68 790 9284: Mechanical engineering
24/1/24, 9:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I have taken note of your concern and I would love to continue with our conversation however, given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion.

26/1/24, 12:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Malcolm.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation yesterday since we were not able to move further with our discussion may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can continue with our discussion?
26/1/24, 12:08 PM - +27 68 790 9284: Afternoon ,yes that is alright
26/1/24, 12:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, now coming back to your concern I would like to understand why do you wish to change your course?
26/1/24, 12:12 PM - +27 68 790 9284: L have thought more about the course l choose a few months ago and compared to my new choice because seems back then l didn’t really research more on the new course and l have had a change of heart
26/1/24, 12:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. I completely understand your interest, however, for Mechanical engineering you are not eligible since you do not have the required subjects combination in your A level.
26/1/24, 1:07 PM - +27 68 790 9284: Ooh what about chemical engineering 🤔
26/1/24, 1:08 PM - +27 68 790 9284: What about if l use my O levels ,am l eligible then
26/1/24, 5:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @27687909284 to pursue engineering in any subject you will require Physics as a subject combination in your A level.
26/1/24, 5:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: If you wish to pursue a diploma in Mechanical Engineering then surely we can have a discussion about it and take your O level results into consideration.
26/1/24, 5:08 PM - +27 68 790 9284: Ooh 🤔..will EDOOFA cover me till l reach the degree level of mechanical engineering if l persue it
26/1/24, 5:09 PM - +27 68 790 9284: Can l please know tye courses l can persue with a level combination only please 🙏
26/1/24, 5:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @27687909284 of course we at Edoofa offer scholarships for degrees in diploma, bachelor's, master's, and even Ph.D.'s.
26/1/24, 5:19 PM - +27 68 790 9284: Ooh 😮how about covering from diploma to degree period full time
26/1/24, 5:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: There are more than 200 courses that are being offered by the universities and if I check your eligibility for every course it is going to be a lengthy process so instead you let me know which course are you inclined towards the most to pursue keeping in mind your A-level subject combination.
26/1/24, 5:25 PM - +27 68 790 9284: Oooh 😯
26/1/24, 5:26 PM - +27 68 790 9284: What about :
Pharmacy 
Radiography 
Optometry
26/1/24, 5:27 PM - +27 68 790 9284: Do you offer industrial chemistry too
26/1/24, 5:36 PM - +27 68 790 9284: And medicine and surgery
26/1/24, 5:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @27687909284 I believe you are confused because I did not get the answer to my question here, it seems like you want to explore every field which is certainly not possible and for me to guide you I would want you to have a focused answer as to what field do you want to make your career exactly in?
26/1/24, 5:47 PM - +27 68 790 9284: Ooh , l have interests in both the medical field and engineering field ,
26/1/24, 5:48 PM - +27 68 790 9284: Especially these when it’s the medical field
26/1/24, 6:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Since you do not have Physics in your A-level you will not be eligible for any engineering course, however, let me tell you that you will even be able to change your course after you arrive in India, and considering that I even noticed that tomorrow stands your deadline for the university registration fee.  So may I know how is your preparations going on?
26/1/24, 6:24 PM - +27 68 790 9284: The preparations are going well , the payment will be made tomorrow l think
26/1/24, 6:24 PM - +27 68 790 9284: What about radiography and medicine please , <This message was edited>
26/1/24, 7:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know @27687909284 once you made the payment please share the receipt with me here.
26/1/24, 7:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @27687909284 stay assured that there are many career opportunities once you arrive in India, however, for me to help you with the exact courses right now I would have to get your application re-evaluated by the board because we once did that when you had an interest in the current course you have and this process would require time since because of the results there is a larger number of application now so I would please encourage you to be patient and once the academic board evaluates your application again I will be able to help you with the courses you are eligible in medical field.
26/1/24, 7:13 PM - +27 68 790 9284: Alright, sorry but can you please extend the deadline to 30 January, my parents said right now it’s still inadequate and they are able to send on the30th

26/1/24, 7:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Since you were able to convey the same to me before I will make sure to have a discussion about the same and since the university is closing round of applications on the 31st of this month I will be able to have a discussion for your extension till 30th.
