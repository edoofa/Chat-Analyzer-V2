12/1/24, 6:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Walusungu,

I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
12/1/24, 6:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
12/1/24, 6:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
12/1/24, 7:48 PM - +260 96 2476932: That's very interesting. 
As a family all is well and we hope it'll be through out the year.
12/1/24, 7:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. With great excitement and pride, I also want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
12/1/24, 7:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
12/1/24, 7:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
12/1/24, 7:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we discuss your admission journey further, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

25/1/24, 11:54 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Walusungu,

I hope this message finds you all well and in high spirits. I apologize for not being in touch over the past few days. Unfortunately, I was dealing with a significant ENT infection and needed to follow my doctor's recommendation for rest, which meant taking some time off to prioritize my health. As a result, I was unable to inform you about my temporary absence. Thankfully, I'm feeling considerably better now and am ready to resume our interactions. Before we proceed with our discussion, I'd like to catch up - how have you and your family been lately?
26/1/24, 12:50 PM - +260 96 2476932: We have been okay thank you. 
I'm glad you are better
26/1/24, 12:50 PM - +260 96 2476932: I'm ready to resume our interactions too
26/1/24, 12:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are doing well and thank you for your concern. On the auspicious occasion of Republic Day, I extend my heartfelt greetings to you and your loved ones. Today marks a significant moment in our nation's history, a day when we commemorate the enactment of our Constitution and celebrate the enduring spirit of democracy and unity that defines us as a country.

26/1/24, 1:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome and thank you for your wishes. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
26/1/24, 1:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your  results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
26/1/24, 1:02 PM - +260 96 2476932: Okay no problem
26/1/24, 1:03 PM - +260 96 2476932: G12 180502180003 BANDA WALUSUNGU: ENG.-1, CVCEDU-1, R.E.-6, MATHS-1, ADDM-2, PHYS-2, CHEM-3, BIOL-1 Result:SCHOOL CERTIFICATE
26/1/24, 1:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @260962476932 thank you for sharing that, however, could you please share the picture of the result since the document would be required for your scholarship application.
26/1/24, 1:07 PM - +260 96 2476932: I'd have to go to school to get the document.
The results are sent via text message
26/1/24, 1:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @260962476932 I understand that however, most of my students from Zambia have shared the document with us, so may I know by when will you be able to collect the document from the school?
26/1/24, 1:09 PM - +260 96 2476932: When I visit the school which is not anytime soon.
I'm currently far from the school but I'll make time
26/1/24, 1:20 PM - +260 96 1590476: Good afternoon, kirt. Maybe explain the kind of documents because these results have barely been announced 4 hours ago, and I doubt if the results are in schools yet.
26/1/24, 2:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @260961590476 there might be confusion since some students were able to share their results with me, might be they appeared last year and hence it was possible for them, however, may I know by when you be able to collect the grade 12 result for Walusungu?
26/1/24, 2:34 PM - +260 96 2476932: We aren't sure but we'll try our best
26/1/24, 2:42 PM - +260 96 1590476: I will be in touch with the school and get back to you ASAP
26/1/24, 2:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @260961590476  surely I will be waiting for your response.
26/1/24, 2:48 PM - +260 96 1590476: Excellent
2/2/24, 3:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Walusungu,

I hope this message finds you well. Please excuse me for not connecting in the past few days, I have been currently dealing with an unexpected family emergency and have taken some time off to provide support to my loved ones during this challenging time and that is why I have not been able to get back to you, however, I will be able to connect with you now onwards.
