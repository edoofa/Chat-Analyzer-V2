17/1/24, 10:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Tanyaradzwa,

I trust this message finds you well. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admission Officer at Edoofa*.

Moving forward, I will be handling the next steps in your university admission journey and will be directing you in the right direction.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Lovely Professional University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
17/1/24, 10:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly.

I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 1:00 PM.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 1:00 PM to 04:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

17/1/24, 10:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/1/24, 10:13 PM - +263 73 267 3608: Good Evening and thanks
17/1/24, 10:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, let us plan to connect tomorrow at 01:00 pm I hope you will be available.
17/1/24, 10:16 PM - +263 73 267 3608: I'd like to know if the issue with the course I wanted was fixed
17/1/24, 10:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, you can go through the letter as well.
18/1/24, 12:31 PM - +263 77 483 8660: Many thanks Kirti for the communication and the offer letter much appreciated. This Erasmos Father to Tanyaradzwa. Is it possible to have at least 3 offer letters for us to make an informed decision. Would appreciate if you can help us in that regard.
24/1/24, 12:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tanyaradzwa,

I trust you're all having a good day. I want to start by apologizing for my absence over the past week. Unfortunately, I was unwell with a severe ENT infection, which required me to rest as per my doctor's advice. Thankfully, I'm feeling much improved now and am eager to reconnect with you so we can continue our discussions. But before we proceed, I'm curious to hear about how your last week went?
24/1/24, 4:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, since we were unable to complete our letter discussion so let us plan to connect today at 06:00 pm CAT, so I can help you understand the offer letter better. I hope you will be available.
24/1/24, 4:28 PM - +263 77 483 8660: Noted Kirti will make time for the discussion hope and pray that network will behave
24/1/24, 4:32 PM - +263 77 483 8660: Well received we are are all good, we that God that you have fully recovered and doing well now. will be connecting at 1800hrs. bye for now
24/1/24, 6:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, with regard to our conversation earlier, may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can connect and continue with our discussion?
24/1/24, 6:23 PM - +263 77 483 8660: Yes please
24/1/24, 7:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
24/1/24, 7:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
24/1/24, 7:20 PM - +263 77 483 8660: Yes please you can continue
24/1/24, 7:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from LPU University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
24/1/24, 7:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
24/1/24, 7:33 PM - +263 77 483 8660: 1. 1225
2. 4years
3. 200
4. 700
24/1/24, 7:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 4-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 8 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $1225 making your per annum tuition fee ($1225*2) = $2450. Is that clear?
24/1/24, 7:46 PM - +263 77 483 8660: Yes
24/1/24, 7:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -

*1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
24/1/24, 7:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
24/1/24, 7:51 PM - +263 77 483 8660: Okay
24/1/24, 7:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
24/1/24, 7:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?
24/1/24, 7:54 PM - +263 77 483 8660: Very clear
24/1/24, 7:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
24/1/24, 7:55 PM - +263 77 483 8660: Yes
24/1/24, 8:00 PM - +263 77 483 8660: So far we are on yearly tuition fees 2450
Food &Accommodation  1675
Exam fee 75
Insurance 50
24/1/24, 8:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $700 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on  January 31st, 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
24/1/24, 8:01 PM - +263 77 483 8660: Total of 4,250
24/1/24, 8:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
24/1/24, 8:02 PM - +263 77 483 8660: Yes
24/1/24, 8:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263774838660 let me help you understand the cost of education that was explained to you while your course was Ba. LLB is $2000-$3000 when you change your course to B.Tech (Mechatronics Engineering) since it is a niche course the cost of education of the same ranges from $2700-$3700. So you per annum cost of education for Tanyaradzwa will be 

Yearly tuition fees $2450
Food &Accommodation $1000 (of campus)
Exam fee 75
Insurance 50 (The insurance and the exam fee are already included in the tuition fee)

Making your total of $3450.
24/1/24, 8:39 PM - +263 77 483 8660: Following
24/1/24, 8:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:
1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of January 31, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).
2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of February 29th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
24/1/24, 8:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before January 31, 2024. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
24/1/24, 8:47 PM - +263 77 483 8660: Okay
24/1/24, 8:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
24/1/24, 8:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
24/1/24, 8:51 PM - +263 77 483 8660: Harare
24/1/24, 8:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
24/1/24, 8:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
24/1/24, 8:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
24/1/24, 8:55 PM - +263 77 483 8660: I don't know if you had attended to that one I might have missed. Is this the best option we have.
24/1/24, 8:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I wanted to get back to your concern at the last of our discussion, so that once you have all the insights of the university then I answer the same, however, if you want I can attend this concern right now as well?
24/1/24, 8:59 PM - +263 77 483 8660: We can finish since you had reserved the answer for the last not a problem
24/1/24, 9:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
24/1/24, 9:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
25/1/24, 7:44 AM - +263 77 483 8660: May be you can respond to my concern before we can proceed to the account details and stuff
25/1/24, 6:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Tanyaradzwa.

I hope you are doing well. Since we were not able to move further with our discussion may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can continue with our discussion?
25/1/24, 7:03 PM - +263 77 483 8660: It's okay you can go ahead. What time are we finishing?
25/1/24, 7:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The discussion is hardly 15 minutes long if you are actively present.
25/1/24, 7:16 PM - +263 77 483 8660: I'm here
25/1/24, 7:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Coming back to your concern do you wish for me to answer your query first?
25/1/24, 7:18 PM - +263 77 483 8660: Yes please
25/1/24, 7:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
25/1/24, 7:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
25/1/24, 7:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
25/1/24, 7:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the LPU and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
25/1/24, 7:24 PM - +263 77 483 8660: Thank you and following
25/1/24, 7:24 PM - +263 77 483 8660: Thanks
25/1/24, 7:29 PM - +263 77 483 8660: Much appreciated, I think that will be of great help if we can have at least 3 quotations from both private and state universities. I would want to understand that these universities are aware of the start of the semesters begining of the second half of the year 2024 and they will share their responses well in time
25/1/24, 7:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by LPU, you would lose out on the scholarship from LPU and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that? <This message was edited>
25/1/24, 7:37 PM - +263 77 483 8660: No I am not aware of the transfer option
25/1/24, 7:37 PM - +263 77 483 8660: Tell me more about it
25/1/24, 7:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with LPU by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at LPU without risking losing out on the scholarship.
25/1/24, 7:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $700 to LPU to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $700.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $700, but because you would have already paid $700 for LPU, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $700 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
25/1/24, 7:46 PM - +263 77 483 8660: Not clear will LPU be ready to release the money to another university after having inconvenienced them or even refused other students for. Won't that be complicated and might end up being forced to enrol with a university I don't like. Thought the plan was  to wait get a few responses then one can do a comparison.
25/1/24, 8:14 PM - +263 77 483 8660: Will be waiting to hear from you bye for now
25/1/24, 8:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263774838660 thank you for your concern, let me help you understand better what you are saying is certainly true however, it only happens when you connect with one agent that does not have universities to offer. However, we here are an Organization and we have partnered with multiple universities even are universities are aware of the same so we first give our students the preference to choose and then finalise the university. Because to us their career comes first. So I hope you are clear now.
25/1/24, 8:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the delay I was occupied with a call with one of a student so I was not able to get back to you
26/1/24, 8:28 AM - +263 77 483 8660: Okay noted
26/1/24, 12:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tanyaradzwa.

I hope you are doing well. Since we were unable to complete our letter discussion yesterday let us plan to connect today at 06:00 pm CAT, so I can help you understand the offer letter better. I hope you will be available.
26/1/24, 12:10 PM - +263 77 483 8660: Will confirm thanks
26/1/24, 6:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
30/1/24, 6:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Tanyaradzwa,

I hope this message finds you well and in high spirits. Over the past couple of days, I have been reaching out to you to discuss your offer letter from *Lovely Professional University*, which is ranked in the top 5 universities in India and top 80 universities globally. 

My intention is to help you understand the next steps for your university admission journey and guide you in the right direction. However, it seems as if my messages have not been able to get through.
30/1/24, 6:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As you recognize, the Edoofa scholarship opportunity is highly competitive, with students from all over the world vying for the scholarship and you have been given a valuable chance to shape your future path.
30/1/24, 6:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: If I know you well from our past discussions, this is not something you will lose out on easily. Hence, that is the reason, I am a bit worried because you have not connected with us over the past couple of days. I believe something must have been bothering you that has prevented you from connecting with us. Is my understanding correct?
30/1/24, 7:05 PM - +263 77 483 8660: Sure Kirti your understanding is very correct. A bit worried about accepting an offer from one university with the hope of getting another one which I am not sure if we are going to get. If it so happens that we fail to get any other offer then my son is going to study with LPU against his wish and my wish too. If I can be assisted there will be great full
30/1/24, 7:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I see, @263774838660 and thank you for sharing your thoughts with me transparenty. If I may inquire, what challenges do you perceive your child facing regarding the offered university, Lovely Professional University?
30/1/24, 7:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am not sure if you're aware, but Lovely Professional University is one of the top universities in India, incomparable to others in terms of ranking and opportunities. In various aspects, LPU even stands alongside prestigious institutions like Oxford, Harvard, and other world-class universities. It has been noteworthy that India's only gold medalist in the previous Olympics was an LPU student. Hence, I would like to understand what factors led to Tanyaradzwa feeling disconnected from Lovely Professional University as a student and what did he have in his mind?
30/1/24, 7:33 PM - +263 77 483 8660: I am afraid that if he gets enrolled in a private university that is lowly rated he will get an inferior qualification that will not be recognized in some other parts of the world and even locally. When I checked from the internet it was said LPU is ranked 38 in India 2023 and ranked 50th in Engineering. That makes me a bit worried. Given his performance at advanced level was hoping to get something better. Not to say LPU is bad though
30/1/24, 7:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I can see where you are coming from, and from what I understand, it seems like you may have been looking in the wrong place. Let me help you understand that there are different ranking bodies in India, and the ranking of each university differs.
30/1/24, 7:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We at Edoofa are directly connected with the educational ministries, governing bodies such as UGC, AICTE, and the universities themselves. Without any doubt or uncertainty, I can confidently say that Lovely Professional University (LPU) is one of the top universities in India. If ranking and exposure are what you are seeking, there is no university better than LPU. If you have any other university on your mind that you feel are better than LPU, maybe you can share your thoughts with me and I can see where you are coming from.
30/1/24, 7:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am not sure about the rankings you saw, but I personally believe you might have checked at the wrong place because LPU is truly exceptional. Students from LPU have been securing the highest placement packages. For your reference, let me share the university's website with you along with the rankings. You will see the immense opportunities and quality education LPU offers.
30/1/24, 7:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 7:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 7:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: While I was sharing the link with you, I realized that I did not update you that LPU is accredited as *NAAC A++*. For your reference, here is the link to the website: [LPU International] (https://www.lpu.in/international/)
30/1/24, 7:59 PM - +263 77 483 8660: Don't know much about India but heard about universities such as Gujarat institute of Technology
30/1/24, 7:59 PM - +263 77 483 8660: How does it compare
30/1/24, 8:00 PM - +263 77 483 8660: Will visit this one when I get to the office tomorrow my wifi is a bit slow from home.
31/1/24, 4:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Tanyaradzwa,

Please excuse the delay in my response. It was quite late last night, and as India is three and a half hours ahead of Zimbabwe, by the time we recommunicated, it was around 11:30 here in India, so I had to close for the day.
31/1/24, 4:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, I am glad to reconnect with you today. Before we continue our discussion, I wanted to ask if you had the chance to go through the pictures and the website link that I shared with you for you to research more about Lovely Professional University?
31/1/24, 4:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I would like to understand your thoughts on this so that I can guide you with the way forward and also address your query about the Gujarat Institute of Technology.
31/1/24, 4:42 PM - +263 77 483 8660: Eish my apologies hey yaa it was really late.
31/1/24, 4:45 PM - +263 77 483 8660: No i didnt there was some deep cleaning exercise so was working from home, however we can start from where we can today then i will go through the website tomorrow.
31/1/24, 4:47 PM - +263 77 483 8660: Sorry for delayed response still doing some work, have a tight schedule. You can go ahead
31/1/24, 5:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I see, @263774838660. That would be absolutely fine. I can understand that work can be hectic sometimes. In the meantime, let me address the message you shared about Gujarat Institute of Technology. If I may ask, how did you come across the same university, and what inclines you towards it, since you mentioned you have heard about it and had it in your mind?
31/1/24, 5:12 PM - +263 77 483 8660: It was just an example of other renown universities and i understand there are more state universities. i just mentioned that one as an example but you can tell me more about private universities versus state owned universities
31/1/24, 5:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly, @263774838660, I am curious about the factors that led you to mention Gujarat Institute of Technology as a potential choice for Tanyardzwa.
31/1/24, 5:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As someone who has been involved in the education sector for the past 15 years, I am sure you are aware that there are more than 800 colleges and 1000 universities in India and I personally haven't come across this university's name in my entire life, even as an Indian citizen.
31/1/24, 5:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Hence, I decided to check with ministries and ranking bodies, and they were surprised by our inquiry about a state-affiliated university that isn't ranked under the NIRF. This suggests that the degree may not be widely recognized internationally. Hence, I wanted to understand your perspective before I comment on the same and help you understand the education system of India in a better way?
31/1/24, 5:36 PM - +263 77 483 8660: I might have mention the name wrongly and it was just an example anyway, and like i said i dont know much about india and you can tell me more about state unirvesities versus private unis
31/1/24, 5:37 PM - +263 77 483 8660: I stand guided
31/1/24, 5:42 PM - +263 77 483 8660: Its not i am trying to be difficult or picking a fight but trying to understand why we settled for LPU only. Hope you appreciate where i am coming from
31/1/24, 6:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Not at all @263774838660, we understand where you are coming from and we have not finalized our decision regarding Lovely Professional University. As promised, there would be more opportunities from other universities as well.
31/1/24, 6:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, your statement about Lovely Professional University not being a good university surprised us. It is one of the top universities, and your perspective seems to reflect a different understanding than what is recognized and proved as per the rankings.
31/1/24, 6:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Additionally, you mentioned concerns about a university that hasn't been recognized and doesn't align with the opportunities presented to you. It is also noted that you expressed uncertainty about the Indian education system, which wasn't communicated to Ms. Kirti. Hence, the lack of activity in the group further added to my uncertainty about your concerns. I hope you are able to resonate with my perspective as well?
31/1/24, 6:11 PM - +263 77 483 8660: There could be some understanding or mix up of things somewhere. You are talking to Tanyaradzwa's father and not sure about inactivity in the group. i am not aware of any other group except this one. i never said LPU is bad i just wanted clarification and and when you raised the issue of then being able to switch university. Thats where i raised a concern to say. in the even the other universities dont offer my son a position, what it will mean is that he will the be left with no option but to just study with LPU. I hope you are a parent and you understand my fear.
31/1/24, 6:17 PM - +263 77 483 8660: My inquiry is informed by some background where some students are enrolled in some lowly rated universities outside Zimbabwe soon after studying they are deployed back home. when their degree programs were then ranked they were relegated to diplomas. We have such cases hence the inquiry. i never mentioned that LPU is a bad university neither have i commented on the India education system. Pardon me if i said anything along those lines or suggested so in any of my utterances. <This message was edited>
1/2/24, 9:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Tanyaradzwa.

I hope this message finds you well. Please excuse me for not connecting in the past few days, I have been currently dealing with an unexpected family emergency and have taken some time off to provide support to my loved ones during this challenging time and that is why I have not been able to get back to you, however, given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
2/2/24, 8:00 AM - +263 77 483 8660: Well received Kirti, we pray that all will be fine after the challenge you went through as a family. Have a great day
