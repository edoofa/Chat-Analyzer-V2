12/1/24, 5:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ian,

I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
12/1/24, 5:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
12/1/24, 5:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
12/1/24, 5:59 PM - +263 78 588 0189: Greetings me and my family are doing okay. Thank you, hope you also doing okay?
12/1/24, 7:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. I am glad to hear that you all are doing okay. With great excitement and pride, I also want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
12/1/24, 7:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
12/1/24, 7:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we discuss your admission journey further, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

15/1/24, 11:38 AM - +263 78 588 0189: That's amazing am sure they learnt alot especially those interested in business
16/1/24, 10:22 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Ian.

I hope you are doing well. Since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday I wanted to reach out and know more about your A-level results. We also had the pleasure of conversing with some of our students who expressed their joy upon receiving their A-Level results.

Reflecting on my own school days, I vividly recall the mix of excitement and anticipation surrounding the result day. It is an important moment that shapes the path of one’s academic journey.
16/1/24, 10:22 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 10:39 AM - +263 78 588 0189: Good morning 
Am doing well thank you for asking. Hope you are all okay?

17/1/24, 7:59 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Ian.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing your results with us. I noticed that your A-level results didn't turn out as we had hoped, particularly with the challenge in one subject. However, I want to take a moment to remind you that this result is not a reflection of your abilities or potential. It's simply a hurdle on your academic journey, one that you are more than capable of overcoming.
17/1/24, 7:59 AM - Kirti Edoofa: It's important to remember that everyone faces setbacks at some point. What matters most is how we respond to them. This is an opportunity for growth and learning. Reflect on the experience, identify areas for improvement, and use this as a stepping stone towards future successes.
17/1/24, 7:59 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Rest assured, that you have Edoofa’s full support in navigating this phase. Whether it's discussing options for retaking the exam, exploring alternative career paths, or just needing someone to guide you, we are here for you. 

I have taken note of your results and I will add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
17/1/24, 7:59 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly allow me time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once I have evaluated your results, along with all the other applications for your university admission, we will reconnect with you to discuss the next steps in your academic journey.
17/1/24, 12:41 PM - +263 78 588 0189: Good Afternoon, thank you so much for your support
25/1/24, 11:53 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ian,

I hope this message finds you all well and in high spirits. I apologize for not being in touch over the past few days. Unfortunately, I was dealing with a significant ENT infection and needed to follow my doctor's recommendation for rest, which meant taking some time off to prioritize my health. As a result, I was unable to inform you about my temporary absence. Thankfully, I'm feeling considerably better now and am ready to resume our interactions. Before we proceed with our discussion, I'd like to catch up - how have you and your family been lately?

After receiving the offer letter from the university where your fee amd scholarship will be mentioned the university will give yiu a few weeks to pay the registration fee($500-$700) which will be adjusted in your tuition fee and hence making the registration fee $0
26/1/24, 1:43 PM - +263 78 588 0189: As of now l do not have any questions but will ask when l do
26/1/24, 1:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*.

26/1/24, 1:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
26/1/24, 2:01 PM - +263 77 625 7311: I am sitting on the edge of chair just to get the great news as I am excited to see him prosper in life
26/1/24, 2:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.
26/1/24, 2:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $750. 

We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution? <This message was edited>
26/1/24, 2:21 PM - +263 77 625 7311: Sounds go that you thou of some of us in Africa. 
 
I am not aware of the solution please share am really excited for this before hearing it
26/1/24, 2:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
26/1/24, 2:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $750. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $375 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $375, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
26/1/24, 2:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 29 , 2024, and your registration fee stands at $750, you'll need to make a payment of $375 on or before January 29, 2024. The remaining $375 should be paid by February 29 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
26/1/24, 2:43 PM - +263 77 625 7311: On registration I remember in 2022 making a payment of $220 is it included or excluded on the $750
26/1/24, 2:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I believe what you are referring to is the Edoofa enrollment fee which is $350, out of which $220 you have already paid, and the $500- $750 registration fee that you are referring to is a one-time payable fee which is a part of your first-year university tuition fee and is not an additional cost to be incurred by you. It is required to be paid once the university issues your offer letter. 

I hope you are clear now?
26/1/24, 3:10 PM - +263 77 625 7311: Yes its cleo I got mixed up
26/1/24, 3:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright please, so may I know if there is anything you will like to inquire about?
26/1/24, 3:24 PM - +263 77 625 7311: At o moment I don’t have only have anything, thank you
26/1/24, 3:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
29/1/24, 11:39 AM - +263 78 588 0189: Yes, am excited
1/2/24, 2:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ian,

I hope this message finds you well. Please excuse me for not connecting in the past few days, I have been currently dealing with an unexpected family emergency and have taken some time off to provide support to my loved ones during this challenging time and that is why I have not been able to get back to you, however, I will be able to connect with you now onwards.
1/2/24, 2:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, on that note please share the following documents with us. 

1. A level results

3. Identity proof.

2/2/24, 11:58 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ian.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing the academic documents it is duly noted with us. The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned. <This message was edited>
