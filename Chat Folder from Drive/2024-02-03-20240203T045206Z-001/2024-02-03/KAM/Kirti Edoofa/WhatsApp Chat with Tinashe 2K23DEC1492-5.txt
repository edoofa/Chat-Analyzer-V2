I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
27/12/23, 4:33 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes
27/12/23, 4:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 4:40 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Done
27/12/23, 4:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
27/12/23, 4:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
27/12/23, 4:42 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes
27/12/23, 4:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
27/12/23, 4:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
27/12/23, 4:50 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes
27/12/23, 5:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
27/12/23, 5:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
27/12/23, 5:29 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes it’s clear
27/12/23, 6:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
27/12/23, 6:12 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes
27/12/23, 6:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
27/12/23, 6:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually
27/12/23, 6:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
27/12/23, 6:14 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes please
27/12/23, 6:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

27/12/23, 6:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

28/12/23, 2:24 PM - +263 71 418 5330: The statement of purpose helps me to get the best scholarship credits and Edoofa has links with the top universities of India because of the 15+years of experience and resources which they have catered for edoofians to have great learning experience . Most institutions were driven by people who were trying to make money rather than pursuing Good education therefore Edoofa has dug deep and looked into visionaries and spent quality time researching for vision Aries who have invested 20+ years of resources into quality education in their institutions and thus Edoofa has seats in this institutions for international students who have scholarship so that they can get quality education. Quality of teaching staff , infrastructure ,opportunities accommodation, are checkpoints tht Edoofa has when selecting a University for students . Edoofa has developed an environment where culture and friendship roll together despite cultural differences. Edoofa’s purpose is not only to get you admitted to a school but the entire vision comes from the fact that they  have spent over 15 years working in the higher education domain working with colleges and Universities so that they can provide quality education and produce employable graduates.
28/12/23, 2:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
28/12/23, 2:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
28/12/23, 2:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
28/12/23, 2:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.

28/12/23, 5:50 PM - +263 71 418 5330: 2. Please elaborate on the difference between Rights and Duties and give a further explanation of the difference in Human Rights and Civil rights.

Rights are defined as claims of an individual that are essential for the development of his or her own self and that are recognized by society or the State these include the right to life, the right to a fair trial, freedom from torture and other cruel and inhuman treatment, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and the rights to health, education and an adequate standard of living.whilst a duty is something that someone is expected or required to do .Examples of duties  include obeying laws, paying taxes, defending the nation and serving on . Furthermore  human rights are the rights you have simply for being a human being which the right to a fair trial and presumption of innocence,freedom of thought, conscience and religion,freedom of opinion and expression,peaceful assembly,freedom of association,  participation in public affairsComparatively, civil rights are contextual meaning you are entitled to specific civil rights through being a citizen of a particular country, nation, or state. Civil rights are proclaimed by the government for the citizens of that country, while human rights are derived from natural law and are universally protected and applied.
28/12/23, 5:53 PM - +263 71 418 5330: 3. What is the difference between a prosecutor and an attorney 


One of the critical distinguishing factors is that a prosecutor typically works for the government agency bringing criminal charges and must prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt while the defense attorney represents the person accused of a crime and attempts to maintain the client's innocence . The prosecutor must charge the accused with a specific crime or crimes, then present evidence that proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty .The prosecutor must also gather evidence to present in court, interview and prepare witnesses to testify in court, research all aspects of the case to prepare for cross-examination, and prepare opening and closing statements.The defense attorney must defend their client against criminal charges. The client is innocent until proven guilty.The attorney represents the client’s best interests at all stages of legal proceedings from arraignment to sentencing.The attorney helps the client to avoid incriminating himself and making sure the client’s constitutional rights are not violated.
28/12/23, 5:55 PM - +263 71 418 5330: 4.Which branch of law are you interested in pursuing, Civil , Corporate, Criminal and why ?


I want to study corporate law because it is an ideal career for my personal goals. I value financial stability and job security in my career,and corporate law provides these, as well as being a fascinating field that offers endless complex problems to solve and demands a wide variety of skills. I researched about corporate law during high school and I enjoyed the day-to-day work and the opportunity to collaborate, problem-solve and think critically about a variety of different matters.  Corporate law is an ideal lifelong career for me.Although sometimes the study of corporate law can be abstract in nature, the practice of corporate law offers a practical and hands-on career. With my legal knowledge I will be able to make a difference in businesses, and communities.

The ability to help others through the use of the  corporate law is not only highly rewarding but most importantly, serves a very needed purpose in the  business society.Corporate lawyers typically have an in-depth understanding of business practices, regulations and documents. In this profession, I might become an expert on topics like contracts, mergers and venture capital. I may also learn about business strategy by observing key decision-making
28/12/23, 5:59 PM - +263 71 418 5330: 5 .What skills do you have that will make you a successful lawyer , please elaborate with an example 

Corporate law is full different options, avenues and arguments for the same problem, and part of my job as a lawyer is choosing what would most benefit my client.Therefor my problem solving skills will help me to excel in my studies and become a great lawyer.Moreso written communication is another great skill which will highly help me in excelling in my studies because Being able to effectively get my ideas across in a variety of writing styles and registers is essential for success in the legal field. Drafting a contract is very different from writing a letter to a client therefore my skills in written communication will help me excel in my career.Verbal communication is key in the legal field and therefore my skills in verbal communication will help me excel since I have experience in public speaking and debate . Communicating my ideas to, as well as the various situations and environments I might find myself in, will alter the way I communicate. Communication is always supplemented with a goal, whether it is to simply get ng point across to my co-worker, or convince a jury. When it comes to law having a rock-solid grasp on spoken word is essential and it helps in winning a case and dominantly excelling .Also lm able to work under pressure As a lawyerI will be required to overcome obstacles and think on the spot on the daily. Thereforebeing high-functioning whilst under internal or external pressure is essential for my career. Whether I am working overnight to meet a deadline or talking to a difficult client working in a people-focused career will undoubtedly bring pressure along therefore my skill will help me overcome these obstacles and become a great lawyer. By applying ycommercial awarenessI will be able to stay abreast of changes in the legal sector and demonstrate to employers and clients that l have the necessary knowledge and law skills. This will help me stand out in the competitive job market and position myself for success in the legal profession.Detail

Attention to detail is an essential skill for any aspiring lawyer. In order to be successful in the field, you must be able to read and interpret complex legal documents, accurately recall facts and information, and spot inconsistencies between documents. Attention to detail is also  a skill which I  have which is important when it comes to researching and interpreting laws, as well as understanding case law and precedents.
This skill is particularly important when it comes to assessing documents and sources. An ability to spot key pieces of information is highly important,whether lm  looking for evidence to support my case or proofreading a contract where missing a detail could derail the whole task. Thus the above stated are skills which l have , thus they will help me to excel in my line of study
28/12/23, 6:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting the academic interview questions it is duly noted with us. May I know by when will you be able to fill out the SOP form?
28/12/23, 7:37 PM - +263 71 418 5330: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 7:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
28/12/23, 7:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
28/12/23, 7:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course BA LLB for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
28/12/23, 7:42 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes
28/12/23, 7:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
28/12/23, 7:46 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes
28/12/23, 7:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
28/12/23, 7:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
28/12/23, 7:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
28/12/23, 7:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
28/12/23, 7:49 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes
28/12/23, 7:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
28/12/23, 7:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
28/12/23, 7:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
28/12/23, 7:58 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes
28/12/23, 8:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
28/12/23, 8:48 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes
28/12/23, 8:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
28/12/23, 8:50 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes
28/12/23, 8:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
28/12/23, 8:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
28/12/23, 9:07 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Okay noted
28/12/23, 9:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
28/12/23, 9:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
28/12/23, 9:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
28/12/23, 9:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I was expecting to hear back from you, but as there hasn't been a response and given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
29/12/23, 2:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Tinashe,

I hope this message finds you in good health. In continuation of our earlier conversation, I'm reaching out to check if you are now available to connect with us. Since we were not able to continue with our discussion yesterday?
29/12/23, 2:29 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes
29/12/23, 3:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: So may I know if you are clear so far?
29/12/23, 3:34 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes
29/12/23, 3:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
29/12/23, 3:36 PM - +263 71 418 5330: No it’s all clear
29/12/23, 3:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
29/12/23, 3:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
29/12/23, 3:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
29/12/23, 3:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
29/12/23, 3:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.

29/12/23, 4:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
29/12/23, 4:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
29/12/23, 4:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
29/12/23, 4:03 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes it’s clearly stated
29/12/23, 4:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
29/12/23, 4:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
29/12/23, 4:17 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes
29/12/23, 4:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
29/12/23, 4:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
29/12/23, 4:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 10, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before January 10, 2024. The remaining $450 should be paid by February 10 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
29/12/23, 4:42 PM - +263 71 418 5330: No 
It’s clearly stated
29/12/23, 4:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
29/12/23, 4:59 PM - +263 71 418 5330: I’m not
29/12/23, 5:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
29/12/23, 5:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
29/12/23, 5:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
29/12/23, 5:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
29/12/23, 5:07 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes 
Clearly noted
29/12/23, 5:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
29/12/23, 5:11 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes
29/12/23, 6:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
29/12/23, 6:06 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes
29/12/23, 6:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
29/12/23, 6:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
29/12/23, 6:10 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes
29/12/23, 6:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
29/12/23, 6:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
29/12/23, 6:12 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes
29/12/23, 6:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
29/12/23, 6:14 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Ohkky noted
29/12/23, 6:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
29/12/23, 7:12 PM - +263 71 418 5330: No
29/12/23, 7:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
29/12/23, 7:18 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes
29/12/23, 7:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.

12/1/24, 6:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Tinashe,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
12/1/24, 6:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
12/1/24, 6:20 PM - +263 71 418 5330: The tution fee is 900 per semester including scholarship??
12/1/24, 6:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263714185330 The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
12/1/24, 6:26 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes
12/1/24, 6:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
12/1/24, 6:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
12/1/24, 6:29 PM - +263 71 418 5330: 1. 900 
2. 5 years 
3. 300
12/1/24, 6:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Could you also let me know about the 4th question?
12/1/24, 6:33 PM - +263 71 418 5330: I actually don’t understand it
12/1/24, 6:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/1/24, 6:40 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Ohkkky I now understand 
It also contributes to the first year tution ??
12/1/24, 6:41 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Semester *
12/1/24, 6:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a five-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 10 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
12/1/24, 6:43 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes the 900 includes accommodation, food and other expenses?
12/1/24, 6:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @~KelvinI appreciate your need for clarity on certain aspects, and as a parent myself, I completely understand the desire for thorough understanding. I'm grateful that you took the time to carefully review the offer letter and compile your questions. It's reassuring to know that you are actively engaged in this process.

Our meeting today is primarily aimed at providing a comprehensive understanding of the offer letter and addressing any concerns you may have. Please be assured that all the queries you have raised will be thoroughly discussed as we proceed.
12/1/24, 6:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As we begin our conversation, I will guide you through the letter, ensuring all aspects are clear. Should there be any remaining questions by the end of our discussion, we will certainly address them as well. Could you please let me know if you are ready to start our discussion now?
12/1/24, 6:52 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes lm ready
12/1/24, 6:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to know that. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
12/1/24, 6:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
12/1/24, 6:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
12/1/24, 6:54 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Noted
12/1/24, 6:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
12/1/24, 6:56 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes
12/1/24, 6:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
12/1/24, 6:58 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes
12/1/24, 6:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
12/1/24, 6:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on January 26 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
12/1/24, 7:06 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Noted
12/1/24, 7:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
12/1/24, 7:15 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes please
12/1/24, 7:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $650  of the registration fee. This $650 can be conveniently paid in two instalments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$325 before the first deadline date of January 26, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$325  before the second deadline date of February 26, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
12/1/24, 7:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $650 within 15 working days, before *January 26, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
12/1/24, 7:17 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes
12/1/24, 7:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
12/1/24, 7:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
12/1/24, 7:18 PM - +263 71 418 5330: I’m in Bulawayo
12/1/24, 7:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
12/1/24, 7:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
12/1/24, 7:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
12/1/24, 7:21 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Thanks
12/1/24, 7:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
12/1/24, 7:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
12/1/24, 7:24 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes please
12/1/24, 7:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
12/1/24, 7:29 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Thanks
12/1/24, 7:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800 <This message was edited>
12/1/24, 7:35 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Noted
12/1/24, 7:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
12/1/24, 7:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
12/1/24, 7:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
12/1/24, 7:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
12/1/24, 7:37 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Well noted
12/1/24, 7:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
12/1/24, 7:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
12/1/24, 7:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
12/1/24, 7:40 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes well noted
12/1/24, 7:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
12/1/24, 7:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
12/1/24, 7:42 PM - +263 71 418 5330: No 
I have no questions
12/1/24, 7:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -

13/1/24, 10:21 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Tinashe!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Galgotias University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
13/1/24, 11:18 AM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes
13/1/24, 11:21 AM - Kirti Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
13/1/24, 11:22 AM - +263 71 418 5330: It is okay
13/1/24, 11:23 AM - +263 71 418 5330: Does the scholarship change when the results are out ??
13/1/24, 12:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand since your results came out yesterday only the re-evaluation will not be possible right now as it takes time since the university has already offered you a scholarship, considering that you have the endowment benefits right which is the $100 grant if you tend to wait for re-evaluation and continue to move forward with the standard admission process you will end up losing the endowment benefits. So my advice regarding your admission offer is to understand the letter better now because I will never want you to miss out on the endowment benefit.
13/1/24, 12:36 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Ohkky 
Noted

24/1/24, 4:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tinashe,

I hope this message finds you all well and in high spirits. I apologize for not being in touch over the past few days. Unfortunately, I was dealing with a significant ENT infection and needed to follow my doctor's recommendation for rest, which meant taking some time off to prioritize my health. As a result, I was unable to inform you about my temporary absence. Thankfully, I'm feeling considerably better now and am ready to resume our interactions. Before we proceed with our discussion, I'd like to catch up - how have you and your family been lately?
26/1/24, 2:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Tinashe,

I hope this message finds you in good health. I wanted to check in following the message I sent previously. I haven't received a response yet and thought perhaps my message didn't reach you.

With that in mind, I'm reaching out again to see if you had the opportunity to go through my previous message and to ascertain if we are still connected with each other?

31/1/24, 5:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Parents and Tinashe,

I hope you are doing well, and I find you in the best of sports. I was expecting a response from your end the past few days and while I was planning my day today, I went through your scholarship application file and noticed that you were supposed to make the payment of your first part of the university registration fee of $325 by 26th of January 2024.

Considering the same, I wanted to reach out to you, share a gentle reminder, and try to understand if you have been able to make the payment of your fee by now so that we can update the academic board and the university officials accordingly?
31/1/24, 5:53 PM - +263 78 231 2993: Will be paid by end of wk
31/1/24, 5:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Okay @263782312993. If I am understanding you correctly, it seems you haven't been able to make the payment of your fee by now? May I inquire about what happened? Were you facing any challenges that prevented you from making the payment of your fee in a timely manner and by when are you planning to make the deposit so that I can update the academic board as well?
2/2/24, 6:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Tinashe

I hope this message finds you well. Please excuse me for not connecting in the past few days, I have been currently dealing with an unexpected family emergency and have taken some time off to provide support to my loved ones during this challenging time and that is why I have not been able to get back to you.
2/2/24, 6:42 PM - +263 78 231 2993: Next week
2/2/24, 7:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263782312993 Thank you for keeping me informed however, I hope you are aware that the deadlines are set by the university officials and we need to adhere to the deadline, if not then there is a high chance that the university will revoke your offer letter. If you were facing a challenge please share the same with me only then will I be able to assist you here?
2/2/24, 7:16 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Can’t I change or choose a University?
2/2/24, 7:18 PM - +263 71 418 5330: <Media omitted>
2/2/24, 8:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for expressing your concerns, I completely understand the importance of choosing the right university for your education, and I appreciate the effort you have put into researching Galgotias University.

Your commitment to ensuring a good university for yourself is commendable. Hence, I would like to address your concerns and offer some guidance. I am sure you must be aware that there are different ranking bodies in India and when you research university rankings and reviews, it's crucial to consider reliable sources such as official university websites, reputable education portals, and recognized ranking platforms.
2/2/24, 8:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: While online reviews provide insights, they might not always represent the complete picture. University rankings can vary based on the criteria considered, and some universities might excel in specific departments or programs.

To provide you with accurate information, Galgotias University is one of the leading universities in the Delhi NCR, which is the capital of India, and was recommended for you after careful consideration. Hence, I am not sure about the places you have looked for, but if I am correct, it seems as if you were exploring the wrong place, and thus these concerns were highlighted.
