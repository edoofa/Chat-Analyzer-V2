30/1/24, 3:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Great

Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has been acknowledged.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
30/1/24, 3:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly allow me time for a few days to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. 

In the meantime, while I was going through your application file, I noticed that you were supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of the Edoofa Enrollment fee of $150 before 11 January 2024.
30/1/24, 3:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Considering the same, I wanted to reach out to you, share a gentle reminder, and try to understand if you have been able to make the payment of your fee by now so that we can update the academic board accordingly?
30/1/24, 3:25 PM - +263 78 081 5279: Thank you Maam
30/1/24, 3:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Also, regarding your third message about the update on the payment of your remaining Edoofa Enrollment Fee, I wanted to ensure that everything is in order with your scholarship application file. Have you had the opportunity to make the payment by now? It would be helpful to receive confirmation so we can proceed accordingly.
30/1/24, 3:34 PM - +263 78 081 5279: We will definitely pay the remaining balance Maam
30/1/24, 3:37 PM - +263 78 081 5279: We will send the receipts as soon as we possible once we pay
30/1/24, 3:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Oh well, If I am understanding you correctly, it seems you haven't been able to make the payment of your fee by now? May I inquire about what happened? Were you facing any challenges that prevented you from making the payment of your fee in a timely manner and by when are you planning to make the deposit so that I can update the academic board as well?
30/1/24, 3:40 PM - +263 78 081 5279: Honestly speaking we weren't faced with any challenges just that we thought maybe we shall await for the reminder from the responsible members
30/1/24, 3:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I understand, @263780815279, and thank you for your honesty about the situation. We have duly noted your expectations. Personally, I believe that when it comes to planning for higher education, students and families often take proactive steps in preparing the fee, and it's important to communicate any challenges they face.

Unfortunately, I was a bit under the weather myself, which led to the delay in sending you a reminder in a timely manner. Now that we have cleared the air, I would like to understand by when you would be able to make the payment of your fee?
30/1/24, 4:05 PM - +263 78 081 5279: Sorry for the delay Maam I was still waiting for response from my parents
30/1/24, 4:07 PM - +263 78 081 5279: By Wednesday next week we would have deposited the fee
30/1/24, 4:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I see @263780815279, however, I am a bit concerned here because it wouldn't be possible for us to extend the deadline until next week. 

Your due date was on the 11th of January, and it has already been 19 days since then. The current round of applications you were a part of was for the month of December, and according to that, the enrollment formalities are to be completed latest by tomorrow - 31st January 2024. 

Your Edoofa Enrollment Fee is $350, and if we miss this deadline, the reapplication fee of $150 will be added, making a total of $430 next week. I'm sure, like us, you want to avoid this additional cost, right?
30/1/24, 8:21 PM - +263 78 081 5279: Ok Maam we will try by all means to meet up with the deadline

By tomorrow we are paying
30/1/24, 8:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I understand, and I will update the board as well. I believe you must have the account details of the payment mode you used the last time to make the payment, correct?
30/1/24, 8:29 PM - +263 78 081 5279: Yes correct
30/1/24, 8:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please. That sounds perfectly fine. Once you have made the payment of your fee, kindly ensure that you share the payment receipt with us, as you have done previously. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. 

I wish you all the best, and please convey our regards to your family as well.
30/1/24, 8:57 PM - +263 78 081 5279: Thank you
31/1/24, 3:27 PM - +263 78 081 5279: Good morning Maam
31/1/24, 3:27 PM - +263 78 081 5279: Good afternoon Maam I hope I find you well we've managed to pay the balance

1/2/24, 2:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
1/2/24, 2:36 PM - +263 78 081 5279: Yes we may start
1/2/24, 2:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
1/2/24, 2:41 PM - +263 78 081 5279: Done
1/2/24, 2:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
1/2/24, 2:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
1/2/24, 2:44 PM - +263 78 081 5279: Well noted
1/2/24, 2:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
1/2/24, 2:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
1/2/24, 2:48 PM - +263 78 081 5279: Noted
1/2/24, 2:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
1/2/24, 2:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
1/2/24, 2:51 PM - +263 78 081 5279: So do you do the application of the VISA for me or...?
1/2/24, 2:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Please note that this is just a brief understanding of what your admission process holds, you will be explained each and every step in detail as we move forward, I would appreciate you being patient, please.

Now if we are clear shall we move ahead?
1/2/24, 2:54 PM - +263 78 081 5279: Noted
1/2/24, 2:54 PM - +263 78 081 5279: Noted
1/2/24, 2:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
1/2/24, 2:55 PM - +263 78 081 5279: Yes please
1/2/24, 2:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
1/2/24, 2:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?
1/2/24, 2:59 PM - +263 78 081 5279: Yes we may
1/2/24, 3:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
1/2/24, 3:01 PM - +263 78 081 5279: Yes please
1/2/24, 3:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.
1/2/24, 3:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
1/2/24, 3:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
1/2/24, 3:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
1/2/24, 3:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
1/2/24, 3:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
1/2/24, 3:08 PM - +263 78 081 5279: Since the Internet connection this side tends to be smooth around 2300hrs to 0500hrs so I would love to promise that I would've gone through them n summarise by tomorrow
1/2/24, 3:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263780815279 Alright please, in that case, can I anticipate that you will be able to go through the videos by tomorrow 01:00 pm?

2/2/24, 4:23 PM - +263 78 081 5279: The core founders of Edoofa gave more knowledge about the  whole program

I remember the Founder talking about the Edoofa Schoolarship Wall of Fan in which they met up with different schools whom they tend to send their proud Edoofians in

Also one of the core Founders once visited the African community where they managed to identify the students with potential in academics also managing to identify those who are making it in life and those who are not 

Also I paying attention to the story of this one student from Cana who paid money to this one agent and the agent disappeared and came after 3 months demanding $300 after that $1000 which was already paid so I heard that the agent was now claiming that they have to ship the documents from China and that there was a need for $300 so our core founders were advising us to not to juc allow anyone who claims to be an agent but they do not have a proper program just like Edoofa has 

One thing I liked about Edoofa is that the Founders highlighted that the purpose of the Edoofa program is not just to get students admitted in schools but tries to make you employable

They were advising students to prepare as much as possible to follow instructions and protocols in which they will have to follow in their universities

Also I heard that Edoofa work with the. University which they gave to a student so as to allow students to persue their goals and get scholarship credits just like Courage a student who was on the Edoofa Schoolarship Wall of Fan 

The program also try to look for the best school that suit the student 

Also with the EWYL program, Edoofa works with the University to assist the student with it

Lastly the founders were advising students to fill out the forms as soon as they are issued to the by the Admission officer they highlighted that you must act smart and make no unnecessary delays
2/2/24, 4:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
2/2/24, 4:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
2/2/24, 4:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
2/2/24, 4:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
