Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.

Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we discuss your admission journey further, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

13/1/24, 1:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond, since it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect on Monday to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation Monday.
16/1/24, 10:27 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Natasha.

I hope you are doing well. Since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday I wanted to reach out and know more about your A-level results. We also had the pleasure of conversing with some of our students who expressed their joy upon receiving their A-Level results.

Reflecting on my own school days, I vividly recall the mix of excitement and anticipation surrounding the result day. It is an important moment that shapes the path of one’s academic journey.
16/1/24, 10:27 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
24/1/24, 6:52 PM - +263 77 932 6462: Hello sir hope l find you well.It is with a heavy heart that becoz of circumstances beyond our own control we have no option but to withdraw Natasha from the scholarship program.we have taken long to make this decision becoz we had hoped our situation would change for the better and allow our daughter to continue with her studies abroad.Due to economic situation prevailing in our country my financial abilities were affected when l lost my job around October last year.As a family we have decided that our remaining source of income may not be able to sustain our child while abroab.We have sat down with Natasha who l should say understood the family predicament.We are therefore officially pulling out of the scholarship program as we are unable to continue with it now and in the future.we want to thank the Edoofa team for the wonderful support we got from you from the. onset.Special thanks to Natasha's mentor Ms Ananyafor being so patient and encouraging even when she could clearly see all was not well with Natasha.Again thank you to everyone.May God bless you all.
25/1/24, 12:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Natasha.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing your challenges with me transparently, I really appreciate it. I am sorry to hear about the difficult circumstances leading to the decision to withdraw Natasha from the scholarship program. It's evident that this decision was not made lightly, and you've navigated this challenging situation with thoughtful consideration for Natasha's future and the family's financial stability. The impact of losing a job, especially in these uncertain economic times, cannot be understated, and I admire the resilience and unity your family has shown in facing these challenges. It's commendable that Natasha understands the family's situation and is supportive of this tough decision.
25/1/24, 12:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, If I may ask may I know what plans do you have in mind for Natasha now, are you planning for her to study locally?
25/1/24, 12:42 PM - +263 77 932 6462: Thank you for the concern and support.As a family we are trying to look at educating her locally however considering the family financial capabilities.She is the eldest child and we are determined to do it
25/1/24, 1:00 PM - +263 77 932 6462: However with the situation we find ourselves in we would rather have her close by as it will not financially both the family and herself
25/1/24, 1:02 PM - +263 77 932 6462: Strain****
26/1/24, 11:47 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Natasha.

I hope you are doing well. Since we were not able to move further with our discussion may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can continue with our discussion?
26/1/24, 12:01 PM - +263 77 932 6462: Good day sir.Its ok we can continue
26/1/24, 12:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263779326462 On the auspicious occasion of Republic Day, I extend my heartfelt greetings to you and your loved ones. Today marks a significant moment in our nation's history, a day when we commemorate the enactment of our Constitution and celebrate the enduring spirit of democracy and unity that defines us as a country.
26/1/24, 12:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 12:03 PM - +263 77 932 6462: Wish you the best during this period of comemmoration
26/1/24, 12:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your wishes. May I know if you are ready to start with the discussion now?
26/1/24, 1:09 PM - +263 77 932 6462: Yes we can
26/1/24, 1:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263779326462 That is good to know now I was able to go through your message above and I noticed you said that Natasha being the eldest child in your family you are determined for her to complete her education locally may I know if my understanding is right here?
26/1/24, 1:16 PM - +263 77 932 6462: Yeah,true you got me right sir
26/1/24, 1:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In that case, could you please help me with the term semester fee of any local university you are planning to make Natasha continue her study with?
26/1/24, 1:21 PM - +263 77 932 6462: Checked around and it's around$500
26/1/24, 1:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, since you mentioned that in Zimbabwe per semester fees are $500 to be on the safer side let us assume it is $600, now as you must be aware each academic year consists of 2 semesters so will make your per annum cost of $1200 only for the tuition fee. 

Now, if she goes to a university she will eventually move out and live close to the university, and for that accommodation, the cost could come up to $50 per month which will make your yearly accommodation cost $600, and moving on to the food, for a decent meal it costs $2 per meal, and for her to have 3 meals it will cost him $6 and this will also cost you yearly $600. Plus some miscellaneous costs of the examination fee which can cost up to $150 per annum.
26/1/24, 1:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now if we sum up the cost here, $1200 + $600 + $600 + $150 = $2550, and this will be the balance if you choose any local university and not the expensive ones and keeping in mind Zimbabwe's economy that degree will not be enough for her to make him employable.

However, here at Edoofa, we make sure that from the tuition fee to accommodation and food everything is covered within the $2000-$3000, and with the affordable education Natasha will also get an international degree recognition alongside the EWYL program that specifically focuses on skill development and making students employable ready. I hope you are able to understand now?
26/1/24, 1:44 PM - +263 77 932 6462: True ,l do and that information made our decision making the  more difficult.And to that end we ended up involving other members of the extended family.all in an effort to find out a better solution.l agree with you this program was the best we could ever provide our daughter.my young brother will take Natasha under his roof reducing on accommodation and food
26/1/24, 1:47 PM - +263 77 932 6462: One thing that helped us reach this decision is that any challenges she may face financially would be less straining on Natasha if she is home than if she is abroad
26/1/24, 2:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263779326462 it's heartening to hear that Natasha has the support of your extended family, which is quite rare and valuable in today’s world. Their willingness to assist in reducing your expenses is commendable. However, I notice that even with this help, the cost still amounts to $1350. Given this investment, I'm curious as to why there might be a willingness to settle for less in her education, especially in an economic climate where even highly educated individuals face challenges in finding suitable employment.

Could you please clarify your perspective on this? Is the goal of completing her education primarily for the sake of having an education, or are there considerations for her long-term employability and career goals? Understanding your viewpoint on this matter would be really helpful.
26/1/24, 3:49 PM - +263 77 932 6462: Taking up the program in the first place and making payments to secure a place for my daughter in its self is evidence enough how much l value her education.since we no longer have a fixed income to finance her education her welfare is better taken care of here than abroad  though at the expense a better education and long term employability.losing my job has shown unpredictable life can be . l value the education of my daughter but am afraid to risk her welfare
26/1/24, 5:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263779326462 That is exactly what I wish for you to understand sir, if you supported her education I would suggest you do not get away from that path and even consider her career opportunities as well. The exposure she is going to get in India is immense you know in recent days the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
