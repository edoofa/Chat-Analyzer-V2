The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to enquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?

21/12/23, 4:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
21/12/23, 4:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.

21/12/23, 4:48 PM - +263 71 438 9968: Yesss. I understand
21/12/23, 4:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the picture, it is noted with us.
21/12/23, 4:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
21/12/23, 4:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
21/12/23, 5:00 PM - +263 71 438 9968: Yess indeed.
21/12/23, 5:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
21/12/23, 5:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
21/12/23, 5:53 PM - +263 71 438 9968: Yes they are clear thank you.
21/12/23, 5:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
21/12/23, 5:55 PM - +263 71 438 9968: Yes we may.
21/12/23, 5:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
21/12/23, 5:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them.

21/12/23, 5:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
21/12/23, 5:59 PM - +263 71 438 9968: Okay thank you. Let me watch them.
21/12/23, 6:00 PM - +263 71 438 9968: I will go through them now.

21/12/23, 7:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know so could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
21/12/23, 7:32 PM - +263 71 438 9968: In video 1...I learnt that students should be teachable and open minded. Students should also be able to follow Edoofa's instructions and they should be able to seek advice from experts.

In video 2, I understood that not onky does Edoofa offer high education at affordable prices, it also helps to increase students' capacity for success making students responsible and independent.
In video 3, I understood that Edoofa invests a lot of time inorder to find suitable schools or universities for Edoofians to study. They also help choose universities with vibrant culture.Attitude, Skills amd Knowledge are required in the process
In the last video i understood that a statement of purpose is an important document which allows a unique opportunity for students to convince any university why they should be accepted and it should include one's goals, vision and academic progress. Thank you.
21/12/23, 7:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
21/12/23, 7:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
21/12/23, 7:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
21/12/23, 7:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
21/12/23, 7:54 PM - +263 71 438 9968: I understand thank you.

21/12/23, 8:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 01:30 PM.
21/12/23, 8:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

6/1/24, 10:44 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
6/1/24, 10:44 AM - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
6/1/24, 10:44 AM - +263 71 438 9968: Yes.We may proceed
6/1/24, 10:48 AM - +263 71 438 9968: 1. $1000
2. $0
3. $2250
4. 125
5. 1000
6/1/24, 10:56 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 75% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout the course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
6/1/24, 11:03 AM - +263 71 438 9968: Yes it is.Thank you so much
6/1/24, 11:06 AM - +263 77 330 0932: Good morning Admission team. Thank you for your time in taking care of our queries. However, I wanted to find out if other universities are going to respond as well before we accept this offer.
6/1/24, 11:13 AM - Kirti Edoofa: @263773300932 I have taken note of your query, and as we move forward with the discussion your query shall be answered however, for now, let us focus on understanding the letter better so that you have a clear understanding of the offer letter.
6/1/24, 11:14 AM - +263 71 438 9968: Okay
6/1/24, 11:22 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $1000
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
6/1/24, 11:22 AM - Kirti Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $2250.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $2250 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $2500.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $2250. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
6/1/24, 11:23 AM - +263 71 438 9968: I understand
6/1/24, 11:25 AM - +263 77 330 0932: I understand, but on the letter they're stating that it's 100% scholarship
6/1/24, 11:30 AM - +263 77 330 0932: On accommodation,  does she has to stay on campus only. Is there an option of staying out of campus?
6/1/24, 11:34 AM - +263 77 330 0932: On the issue of commencing studies, when is she expected to be in India?
6/1/24, 3:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concerns I have taken a note of all your queries and I would love to continue with our discussion, since it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect on Monday to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation monday.
6/1/24, 3:36 PM - +263 71 438 9968: Okay.Have a great day
8/1/24, 11:00 AM - +263 77 330 0932: Good morning team.
8/1/24, 4:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tadiwa.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation previously, I wanted to schedule our discussion for today at 06:00 pm so that we can have a complete discussion about the concerns that you have shared as well in detail.
8/1/24, 6:28 PM - +263 77 330 0932: Well noted.
8/1/24, 6:30 PM - +263 77 330 0932: I am now free to connect
8/1/24, 8:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, kindly excuse me for not reaching out to you at 06:00 pm since I was on a work call and then I went for my dinner break. However, we can connect now, may I know if you are available now?
8/1/24, 8:05 PM - +263 77 330 0932: It is well. We can continue
8/1/24, 8:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Coming to your concerns from yesterday let me help you understand. As you can see in the letter, Tadiwa has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, which means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. However, if you wish to choose off-campus then that cost will be an extra expense for you.
8/1/24, 8:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The academic intake in India commences in August 2024, and she will be expected in India by Mid- August.
8/1/24, 8:22 PM - +263 71 438 9968: If I may ask,so my annual fee would be $2250  per annum for 4 years?
8/1/24, 8:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for pointing that out, it is a clerical error by the university and I have updated the team as well they will get the letter updated, however, as per Tadiwa's course since it is a niche course hence she is been granted a 75% scholarship. So please do not worry about that.
8/1/24, 8:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, your annual tuition fee is $2250, which includes your accommodation as you have been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses.
8/1/24, 8:24 PM - +263 71 438 9968: Okay thank you
8/1/24, 8:25 PM - +263 77 330 0932: Thank you for clarifying. My other query is that you mentioned that we will get some more responses from other universities for comparison's sake, have you received them?
8/1/24, 8:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
8/1/24, 8:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
8/1/24, 8:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
8/1/24, 8:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the MVN and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
8/1/24, 8:32 PM - +263 77 330 0932: It is very clear but my worry will be on MVN  lead time which they said it's 15 days to secure the university seat
8/1/24, 8:33 PM - +263 77 330 0932: Won't we run out of time in paying within their timeframe?
8/1/24, 8:35 PM - +263 77 330 0932: Also explain further by what you said on a niche course.
8/1/24, 8:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by MVN, you would lose out on the scholarship from MVN and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
8/1/24, 8:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely I will, let me explain the queries one by one.
8/1/24, 8:38 PM - +263 77 330 0932: I am not aware the transfer
8/1/24, 8:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with MVN by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at MVN without risking losing out on the scholarship.
8/1/24, 8:40 PM - +263 71 438 9968: Noted
8/1/24, 8:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $1000 to MVN to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $1000.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $1000, but because you would have already paid $1000 for MVN, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $1000 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
8/1/24, 8:43 PM - +263 77 330 0932: We are together on this part. My other question is, are we able  to pay in halves the $1000
8/1/24, 8:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes @263773300932 we are getting to that point.
8/1/24, 8:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, we do that I would appreciate you to be a little patient and let us first discuss the letter in detail so that we have a better understanding of the letter, may I know if that is fine?
8/1/24, 8:47 PM - +263 77 330 0932: It is fine,
8/1/24, 9:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion, since it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow at 06:00 pm.
9/1/24, 2:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I would love to continue with our discussions however, I regret to inform you that I'm currently not feeling well. As a result, I just came to inform you that I would like to reschedule our discussion for tomorrow. I hope this works for you and that you'll be available to connect tomorrow. Thank you for your understanding.
9/1/24, 2:45 PM - +263 77 330 0932: Ooh sorry Ms Kirti. I hope you will recover soon.
9/1/24, 3:49 PM - +263 71 438 9968: Thank you.Get well soon.
10/1/24, 11:12 AM - +263 77 330 0932: Good day Ms Kirti. I hope you're recovering well.
10/1/24, 2:27 PM - +263 77 330 0932: Have you received the amended official letter from MVN?
10/1/24, 2:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tadiwa.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for asking, I am doing better than yesterday. The team has updated the university @263773300932 once we shall receive the same we will update you, please do not worry.
10/1/24, 2:34 PM - +263 77 330 0932: I am glad you're getting better. Sorry, is it ok to reschedule our discussion time to during the day because at 6pm I will traveling home so it is difficult to communicate
10/1/24, 2:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263773300932 Surely we can, may I know what time is suitable for you considering that our working hours are from 12:30 pm to 08:30 pm?
10/1/24, 2:39 PM - +263 77 330 0932: From 12:30pm to 17:00pm will be ok
10/1/24, 2:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, in that case, tomorrow we can connect from 03:00 pm to 05:00 pm, and today we can connect at 04:00 pm rather than 06:00 pm, may I know if it is alright by you?
10/1/24, 2:46 PM - +263 77 330 0932: It is well with me
10/1/24, 2:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, let us reconnect today at 04:00 pm.
10/1/24, 4:11 PM - +263 77 330 0932: Greetings to you
10/1/24, 4:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if we can connect now?
10/1/24, 4:25 PM - +263 77 330 0932: Yes,we can connect.
10/1/24, 4:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: So may I know if you are clear so far?
10/1/24, 4:31 PM - +263 77 330 0932: So far so good
10/1/24, 4:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
10/1/24, 4:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make his/her education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
10/1/24, 4:35 PM - +263 77 330 0932: I have gone through the list
10/1/24, 4:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2500, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
10/1/24, 4:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
10/1/24, 4:37 PM - +263 77 330 0932: It is clear
10/1/24, 4:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
10/1/24, 4:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his/her annual fee, which is $2250. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2250 - $1000 = $1250, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
10/1/24, 4:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
10/1/24, 4:39 PM - +263 77 330 0932: Yes, it clarifies the whole process
10/1/24, 4:40 PM - +263 77 330 0932: It will be up to the student to work hard in earning the credits
10/1/24, 4:46 PM - +263 77 330 0932: On living cost what exactly will be covered
10/1/24, 5:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Living cost basically means the accommodation cost.
10/1/24, 5:01 PM - +263 77 330 0932: Ok
10/1/24, 5:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
10/1/24, 5:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $2500 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $1500 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
10/1/24, 7:46 PM - +263 71 438 9968: Yes. It is clear
10/1/24, 7:47 PM - +263 77 330 0932: Well noted.
10/1/24, 7:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that your financial preparations are in place. I hope you recall that the per annum cost of education and the registration fee figures you mentioned were supposed to face a range of $2,000 to $3,000 for the annual cost of education and a registration fee between $500 and $1000.
10/1/24, 7:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, based on the discussions we had with your career counselor and their assessment of your application, they encouraged us to secure a higher quantum of scholarship for you. This is the reason the per annum cost of education is only $2250, which is significantly within the cost of education fee range ($2000 to $3000).
10/1/24, 7:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: When you look at this opportunity, with a higher quantum of scholarship, the registration fee may also appear a bit higher. Rest assured, this does not increase your financial burden, as it is an integral part of your first year of education cost and will be utilized for the same purpose. I hope this makes sense?
10/1/24, 7:49 PM - +263 71 438 9968: Yess indeed
10/1/24, 7:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In continuation of our discussion, I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for you is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that you will find a more affordable and high-quality education. 

Certainly, there are other universities that may assess your scholarship qualifications, and with those, the cost of education may fall within the specified range I mentioned earlier. <This message was edited>
10/1/24, 7:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?
10/1/24, 7:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It's essential to consider the big picture and the overall financial benefits that come with the scholarship offer you have received. Do you not agree with this?
10/1/24, 7:55 PM - +263 71 438 9968: I do agree
10/1/24, 7:56 PM - +263 71 438 9968: Can you please give an example of the 2 options
10/1/24, 8:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263714389968 I am sorry I did not understand your question very well here, could you please help me understand better?
10/1/24, 8:17 PM - +263 71 438 9968: My question is can you please further clarify using specific amounts so that i can differentiate between the two options you have given me
10/1/24, 9:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concerns I have taken note of your query and I would love to continue with our discussion, since it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow at 03:00 pm to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
10/1/24, 9:31 PM - +263 71 438 9968: Thank you so much.Good night to you too
11/1/24, 3:44 PM - +263 77 330 0932: Good day
11/1/24, 6:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening parents and Tadiwa,

I trust this message finds you well. Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you earlier as I was occupied with a meeting. I wanted to follow up on our previous conversation and inquire if you're currently available to connect with us. This would allow us to continue our discussion as we had originally planned.
11/1/24, 6:30 PM - +263 71 438 9968: Good evening
11/1/24, 7:29 PM - +263 77 330 0932: Good day, kindly go ahead
11/1/24, 7:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we can connect now, may I know which two options are you talking about here?
11/1/24, 7:49 PM - +263 71 438 9968: The question you asked yesterday
11/1/24, 7:49 PM - +263 71 438 9968: This one
11/1/24, 8:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263714389968 Let me help you understand better with an example here at MVN university your annual cost of education is within the range of $2000- $3000 at $2250 right?
11/1/24, 8:43 PM - +263 71 438 9968: Yes
11/1/24, 8:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let's consider this scenario: If at University A, the annual cost begins at $3000, along with a $500 registration fee, would you view the total educational expense as $3500, or would you consider the annual cost to be $2250, which helps you save those $500 annually?
11/1/24, 8:50 PM - +263 71 438 9968: I would consider the annual cost yo be 2250
11/1/24, 8:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to see we share the same perspective. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $2,500. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you arrive in India will be $2,500 - $1,000 = $1500. This amount can be paid in two installments of $750 and $750, spaced 6 months apart.

The first installment can be paid either before arrival in India or within three days of arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.

I hope this clarifies the fee structure, are we aligned on these options?
11/1/24, 8:53 PM - +263 77 330 0932: It's clear
11/1/24, 8:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as January 20, 2024*.
11/1/24, 8:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
11/1/24, 8:54 PM - +263 71 438 9968: Yesss indeed
11/1/24, 8:55 PM - +263 71 438 9968: Yes
11/1/24, 8:55 PM - +263 77 330 0932: Please explain
11/1/24, 9:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $900 of the registration fee. This $900 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $450 before the first deadline date of *January 20, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $450 before the second deadline date of *February 20, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
11/1/24, 9:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $900 within 15 working days, before January 20th, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
11/1/24, 9:02 PM - +263 71 438 9968: Yes.It is very clear
11/1/24, 9:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
11/1/24, 9:02 PM - +263 77 330 0932: Yes we are on the same page.
11/1/24, 9:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
11/1/24, 9:03 PM - +263 77 330 0932: Yes I reside in Harare
11/1/24, 9:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
11/1/24, 9:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
11/1/24, 9:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
11/1/24, 9:05 PM - +263 77 330 0932: Thank you for the contact.
11/1/24, 9:07 PM - +263 77 330 0932: I will get in touch with him soon. But I haven't received the official amended acceptance letter
11/1/24, 9:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concern regarding the official admission letter - The letter is issued by the university once a student completes all admission formalities, including the payment of the entire registration fee. If you wish to receive the letter early for visa application purposes, the sooner you complete the entire payment, the earlier we can assist you with the admission acceptance letter and proceed to the next stages of the process.
11/1/24, 9:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
11/1/24, 9:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles RTGS for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
11/1/24, 9:12 PM - +263 77 330 0932: Let me use Mr Rajan.
11/1/24, 9:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please you can let me share the details just in case. 

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
11/1/24, 9:13 PM - +263 77 330 0932: I understand, I will pay first then get the acceptance letter
11/1/24, 9:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, you are correct.
11/1/24, 9:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
11/1/24, 9:15 PM - +263 77 330 0932: No queries at all, it's crystal clear.
11/1/24, 9:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, in that case, let me share a few insights into MVN University with you -

11/1/24, 9:17 PM - +263 77 330 0932: Sorry on the 7% for Mr Rajan is it charged on cash
11/1/24, 9:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/1/24, 9:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: These resources are designed to help you familiarize yourself with the university and its academic environment, even when physical visits are not possible.
11/1/24, 9:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly, as he will be assisting in facilitating your cash payments to the Indian account, he will essentially be covering the transfer charges. This means basically he will be paying the transfer charges that you pay to him while depositing the money here.
11/1/24, 9:26 PM - +263 77 330 0932: I understand the part of bank charges, thank you.
11/1/24, 9:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome,  before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasize the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents
11/1/24, 9:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realising your dream of pursuing education abroad.

17/1/24, 4:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is regarding the queries you shared with us. You shared two concerns with us let me answer them one by one, let me answer the second concern first. Since the results are out right now, and we the universities are getting a larger number of applications the re-evaluation will take time, but stay assured it will be evaluated may I know if you are clear so far?
17/1/24, 4:04 PM - +263 77 330 0932: This is clear, thank you
17/1/24, 4:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now coming to your second concern, I believe I did explained the transfer option with you, so as soon as we get any updates I will notify you stay assured.
17/1/24, 4:13 PM - +263 77 330 0932: Alright thank you for clarifying
17/1/24, 4:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, have a blessed day ahead.
17/1/24, 4:14 PM - +263 77 330 0932: Same to you. Thank you
19/1/24, 2:10 PM - +263 77 330 0932: Good day Ms Kirti, may you please try to send Tadiwa's application to PDM university and Chandigarh
24/1/24, 1:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tadiwa,

I trust you're all having a good day. I want to start by apologizing for my absence over the past week. Unfortunately, I was unwell with a severe ENT infection, which required me to rest as per my doctor's advice. Thankfully, I'm feeling much improved now and am eager to reconnect with you so we can continue our discussions. But before we proceed, I'm curious to hear about how your last week went?
24/1/24, 1:09 PM - +263 77 330 0932: Sorry to hear that you were a bit under the weather. I am glad you're now ok. I was worried about you and your team why you were not responding. Now that you are here, I am 😊
24/1/24, 3:37 PM - +263 77 330 0932: Good day
24/1/24, 3:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, thank you for your concern, and coming back to your concern regarding sharing Tadiwa's application with PDM University and Chandigarh University. Let me inform you that PDM University is already one of our partnered universities and we have shared Tadiwa's application with them as well we are awaiting their response.  Since you mentioned CU yourself I understand that it is easy for you to fall in love with what you see on the internet. I am sure with your research, you must have noticed that India is a country that has over 850 universities, and every university has its own eligibility criteria.
24/1/24, 3:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is practically impossible for us to apply to all these universities, so once the admission file of the student is ready, we handpick the university based on the ranking, its quality of education, its quality of teachers, practical exposure, etc. which actually would be a right fit for the students and then we share the application with them.

Now, if students have the same freedom, the only problem is that the information that the students receive is only from the internet and the internet is a place where everyone has the freedom to write and claim anything. You would often find that universities are mentioned as top universities, whereas in reality, it is not so.
24/1/24, 3:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Being Indians, we are connected with the Ministries, and Education Board where we have the rankings and information of the universities, and based on that we recommend. 

Whereas sometimes who is sitting 1000 miles away, the only source of information would be the internet and we do not want a situation where you later complain about the quality.
24/1/24, 3:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You know there was recently a case regarding the Chandigarh University girls' hostel and huge protests erupted after disturbing news emerged from the girl's hostel that private videos of several hostel girls were secretly recorded in the hostel bathroom and were circulated on the internet. 

I am sure being an outsider, you might not be familiar with it. When we know all this about the university and the management working there, there is no way we can ever think of partnering with such universities and sending our students over there. I hope you understand the same now?
24/1/24, 4:04 PM - +263 77 330 0932: Sure I do understand. Thank you for clarifying and you being there you've better information.
24/1/24, 4:05 PM - +263 77 330 0932: So having explained this, what is our next step?
24/1/24, 5:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, for the next steps we wait for other universities' responses once we get an update I shall notify you, please do not worry.
24/1/24, 7:02 PM - +263 77 330 0932: All is well thank you.
31/1/24, 9:15 AM - +263 77 330 0932: Good morning Ms Kirti. I hope you are well. I just wanted to ask that besides the August intake, is there an earlier intake
1/2/24, 2:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tadiwa,

I hope this message finds you well. Please excuse me for not connecting earlier, I have been currently dealing with an unexpected family emergency and have taken some time off to provide support to my loved ones during this challenging time and that is why I have not been able to get back to you, however, I will be able to connect with you now onwards.
1/2/24, 2:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing fine, thank you for your concern let me help you understand the academic intake in India commences in the month of August of only every year.
1/2/24, 2:59 PM - +263 77 330 0932: I am happy you're back. I hope all will be well with you and your family 🙏
1/2/24, 3:13 PM - +263 77 330 0932: Ok thank you.
1/2/24, 3:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your concern, I really appreciate it.
2/2/24, 2:55 PM - +263 77 330 0932: Good day Ms Kirti
2/2/24, 3:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tadiwa.

I hope you are doing well. May I know if you wish to share any thoughts of concerns?
2/2/24, 3:11 PM - +263 77 330 0932: Yes, I am wondering how long it takes for the admission letter to come out after paying the $1000. Has the accounts department confirmed the payment? <This message was edited>
2/2/24, 3:13 PM - +263 77 330 0932: I have noted also this section on MVN offer letter page 2 on scholarship and sponsorship details:
2/2/24, 3:14 PM - +263 77 330 0932: <Media omitted>
2/2/24, 3:15 PM - +263 77 330 0932: Point A and B
2/2/24, 4:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for bringing up the queries, let me help you explain the queries one by one. Since we still await responses from other universities so once we receive that update and after you finalize your desired university then the official admission acceptance letter will be issued. I hope this is clear?
2/2/24, 4:14 PM - +263 77 330 0932: Yes
2/2/24, 4:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing now coming to your second query as informed to you above that the offer letter had a clerical error because the scholarship offered to Tadiwa is 75% and the sponsorship on accommodation is 100%. I hope you are clear now?
