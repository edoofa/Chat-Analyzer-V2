I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
12/1/24, 6:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
12/1/24, 6:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 9:28 PM - +263 78 402 4807: yes l am

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
17/1/24, 11:19 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly allow us time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, Mr. Austin, the senior career counselor at Edoofa will connect with you to guide you on the next steps in your academic career.
22/1/24, 11:34 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Greetings dear parents and Nissi
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence, I request you to come online at *2:00 pm CAT tomorrow* and notify on this platform so that I can guide you ahead.
22/1/24, 11:36 PM - +263 78 402 4807: okay thank you

We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge.

We are associated with 300+ schools, having 2500+beneficiaries, parents and associates from the country

23/1/24, 5:55 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I appreciate your determination, Nissi!
23/1/24, 5:55 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
23/1/24, 5:58 PM - +263 78 402 4807: no you can enlighten me
23/1/24, 5:59 PM - +263 78 402 4807: thank you
23/1/24, 6:00 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 6:00 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Therefore, It is important to know the facts of Edoofa's guidance and uniqueness compared to the normal University approach.

1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
23/1/24, 6:00 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 6:00 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

29/1/24, 8:57 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Morning Nissi!
How are you doing?
29/1/24, 8:58 AM - +263 77 641 7275: l am fine sir, thank you for asking
29/1/24, 9:02 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good to hear that, Nissi!
Do you recall our previous discussions?
29/1/24, 9:02 AM - +263 77 641 7275: yes
29/1/24, 9:10 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Great, As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
29/1/24, 9:13 AM - +263 77 641 7275: Due to some troubles with my phone l have lost some information about it. So you can share so that l can recall that
29/1/24, 9:16 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: In that case, let me help you with the understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:- <This message was edited>
29/1/24, 9:17 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counseling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program *as I will be recommending your application for a higher quantum of scholarship.* Congratulations on the same. Now, let us assume,
29/1/24, 9:17 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*

4. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
29/1/24, 9:17 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education ($1650-$1000= $650) and this remaining fee of $650 is supposed to be paid within 3 days of arrival.
29/1/24, 9:17 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
29/1/24, 9:41 AM - +263 77 641 7275: yes
29/1/24, 9:42 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Do you have any questions for me as of now?
29/1/24, 9:42 AM - +263 77 641 7275: when will the registration be paid
29/1/24, 9:43 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: If you receive the Offer letter this week, the first half of registration fee is supposed to be paid within 15 days from the date of receiving and the next part within 30 days
29/1/24, 9:44 AM - +263 77 641 7275: okay
29/1/24, 9:44 AM - +263 77 641 7275: no l don't
29/1/24, 10:11 AM - +263 77 641 7275: There is this question that just came up.
What if l want to work while studying maybe a part time job for me to help my parents in paying for the tuition fee
29/1/24, 10:24 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Please note that in India, international students aren't permitted to do part time jobs as the major focus is on education. This is also the reason, we have combined a work study program which is the *Earn WHile You Learn* that is not just benefit you by earning scholarship credits but also by gaining employability skills along with hands on knowledge
29/1/24, 12:34 PM - +263 77 641 7275: okay thank you
29/1/24, 12:39 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: You are welcome!
29/1/24, 12:40 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: It is really crucial to reserve your University seat with the completion of the registration fees. So I have made a special request to our Academic Board and a recommendation for you to be reconsidered at the earliest. May I know, how far is your family prepared towards the University registration fee as of now?
29/1/24, 12:45 PM - +263 77 641 7275: its a bit early for them to be able to pay the amount in the stated dates
29/1/24, 12:45 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I understand and how much time will your family require to prepare towards the registration fees?
29/1/24, 12:47 PM - +263 77 641 7275: I would need my mother to answer that so l am going ask her
29/1/24, 12:52 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Sure Nissi
