16/1/24, 11:54 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Proud Edoofians,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their MSCE results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 11:54 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your MSCE results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your MSCE results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

17/1/24, 8:36 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Joyce.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
17/1/24, 8:36 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly allow us time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, Mr. Austin, the senior career counselor at Edoofa will connect with you to guide you on the next steps in your academic career.
17/1/24, 8:45 AM - +265 980 85 18 76: Good morning, we have noted with thanks
22/1/24, 2:21 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Day, Mr. & Mrs. Phiri and Joyce,
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence I request you to come online at the earliest and notify me so that I can guide you ahead.
22/1/24, 4:39 PM - +27 79 458 0805: Good Day Mr Austin, thanks so much for such a privilege. We eagerly waiting to hear from you as where to from now.
22/1/24, 5:01 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good to hear from you, Mr Phiri!

22/1/24, 5:02 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: *Congratulations to Jouce on passing the MSCE* At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.

May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
22/1/24, 5:03 PM - +27 79 458 0805: Thus awesome
22/1/24, 5:12 PM - +27 79 458 0805: Let's wait for Joyce herself to come online and provide the right answer. I only did the payment in full.
22/1/24, 5:14 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Sure that would be fine, 
Do you have the receipt for the payment?
22/1/24, 5:17 PM - +27 79 458 0805: For the $350 registration?
22/1/24, 5:25 PM - +27 79 458 0805: <Media omitted>

22/1/24, 5:33 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I was referring to the University Registration fee after receiving the Offer Letter please
22/1/24, 5:50 PM - +27 79 458 0805: No that one we didn't proceed with the payment because Joyce applied for Business Administration,  but the offer was a different course. After engaging your colleague, he admitted that it was an error and promised to come back with a different offer. We have been waiting since then
22/1/24, 5:51 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I do understand Mr Phiri and let me fastrack the process for you!

Apart from the same, are you having any questions for me as of now?
22/1/24, 5:55 PM - +27 79 458 0805: No questions for now sir . I appreciate your willingness to help. We'll be looking forward to that.
22/1/24, 6:06 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Noted, Mr Phiri!
Meanwhile, you can go through the reasons why the Edoofa guidance will be unique compared to the normal University approach.
22/1/24, 6:06 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
22/1/24, 6:06 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 6:06 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

22/1/24, 8:04 PM - +265 980 85 18 76: Noted with thanks
22/1/24, 8:14 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: You are welcome, Mr Phiri!
22/1/24, 8:16 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Just to reiterate you through the costs, As we discussed in the counseling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $1600-$2300 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program *as we recommended Jpyce's application for a higher quantum of scholarship.* Congratulations on securing the same. Now, let us assume,
22/1/24, 8:16 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $1000 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $800 per annum
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $200 per annum

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1000 + Accommodation Fee $800 + Remaining Fee Components $200 = $2000 per annum.

4. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
22/1/24, 8:17 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education ($2000-$1000 = $1000) and this remaining fee of $1000 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $500 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $500 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.

I believe you recall this discussion with our Admissions Officer.
22/1/24, 8:23 PM - +265 980 85 18 76: Yes ,we recall this
22/1/24, 8:44 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: That is good and now, you can await the rectified Offer Letter. If you any questions comes to your mind in future, you can feel free to ask

25/1/24, 9:26 PM - +265 980 85 18 76: Thank you sir
25/1/24, 9:27 PM - +265 980 85 18 76: Good evening
25/1/24, 9:32 PM - +265 980 85 18 76: I have a question,since you sayed that there are different offer letter that are released so how long will it take for the others to be out too?
25/1/24, 10:04 PM - +27 79 458 0805: Thanks Mr Austin,  we will go through it.
29/1/24, 10:27 AM - +27 79 458 0805: Good Day to you Mr Austin.  I would like to find out, is it possible to pay half of the $1000 within the stipulated 15 working days and finish the other half later?
29/1/24, 10:33 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Day Mr Phiri!
How are you doing?

We celebrated India's 75th Republic day on the Friday and was unavailable in the weekend due to which I was unable to get back to you. Please excuse me for the same
29/1/24, 10:34 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: That is right, Joyce
The duration depends on the evaluation of the Universities. Moreover, even if you complete the registration fee payment, it is possible to transfer to another University after another offer letter
29/1/24, 10:34 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: You are most welcome!
29/1/24, 10:34 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Yes Mr Phiri, you can pay the first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days
29/1/24, 10:38 AM - +27 79 458 0805: Okay thus perfec I get you. Thank you for your time.
29/1/24, 10:43 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: You are welcome, do you have any questions for me as of now regarding the Letter?
29/1/24, 10:52 AM - +27 79 458 0805: Yes one more question. Why  is the registration fee different from previous letter, which was $500 only?
29/1/24, 10:55 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: The registration fee differs from University to University and course to course. Since the course has been corrected, the registration fee is $1000 but this isn't an additional fee and will be adjusted from the first year tuition fee itself.
29/1/24, 10:58 AM - +27 79 458 0805: Okay thus understood. Thank you I appreciate explaining.
29/1/24, 10:58 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: You are welcome,
May I know, when are you planning to initiate the transaction of the first part?
29/1/24, 11:07 AM - +27 79 458 0805: We'll be ready on the last day( of the 15 working days)
29/1/24, 11:14 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Well Mr Phiri, I just had a discussion with our Head of Admissions. Since we are experiencing a huge rush of qualifiers as the Senior Level results are out in Countries such as Zambia, Zimbabwe and South Africa, it is important to reserve the seat at the earliest. Therefore, it is encouraged to pay a part of the registration fee within this month(It need not be the half itself) and the remaining can be paid as per the timeframe.
29/1/24, 11:29 AM - +27 79 458 0805: Well it's fine. But that would mean we can only manage to pay a small fraction of the amount like R2,500 on Wednesday, the 31st of January, 2024.
29/1/24, 11:34 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: This is well noted, Mr Phiri and which mode of payment would you prefer for the same?
29/1/24, 11:38 AM - +27 79 458 0805: Mama money is the best for me.
29/1/24, 11:47 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Noted Mr Phiri, The Mama Money order will be sent to you on the 31st.
29/1/24, 11:51 AM - +27 79 458 0805: Sure, thank you Mr Austin
29/1/24, 11:55 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: You are welcome, have a great day ahead!
29/1/24, 11:57 AM - +27 79 458 0805: Pressure same to you
