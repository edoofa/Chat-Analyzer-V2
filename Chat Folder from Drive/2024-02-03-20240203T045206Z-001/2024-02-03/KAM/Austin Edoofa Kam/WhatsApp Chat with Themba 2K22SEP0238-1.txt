I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.

2/2/24, 11:15 AM - +263 77 799 6606: Engineering is being offered to many people and even the one with o level only so after me going for my A level, l didn't like the option which can be done by anyone yet I have more advanced level than them
2/2/24, 11:17 AM - +263 77 799 6606: For medicine, it's few people who can go for medicine since few people go for  A level
2/2/24, 11:17 AM - +263 77 799 6606: Had a brief chat with on Facebook didn't know he was India, I will have a chat with him
2/2/24, 11:21 AM - +263 77 799 6606: My most worry is having a degree and later go back home with my degree having no job to work for
2/2/24, 11:22 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I do understand your perspective Themba but at the end of the day, it is about your passion and aspirations which would lead you to the right domain that would help you gain financial stability and self satisfaction
2/2/24, 11:22 AM - +263 77 799 6606: One thing l choose eden was that l got a friend of mine who is doing medicine in zambia and his father is a doctor in Namibia and was much certain that after my degree will follow where he will be working since his father will be linking him and will simply follow his footsteps
2/2/24, 11:24 AM - +263 77 799 6606: I had to force myself from the start since l heard that in order for one to do medicine should be doing maths physics biology and chemistry at the same time from some of my friends before l even started applying
2/2/24, 11:26 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: It is good to see your aspirations and the reason that inclined you towards Medical field. At the same time, have you also researched on other medical courses?
2/2/24, 11:30 AM - +263 77 799 6606: No l didn't research on any other medical courses since l didn't have any passion or desire of doing them ie pharmacy, biochemistry etc
2/2/24, 11:46 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I understand Themba and let me inform you that you need to be deeply interested in the field of education.Moreover, if you are at the right place doing the right degree with proper guidance, you will be able to venture into a lot of career and higher education opportunities
2/2/24, 11:47 AM - +263 77 799 6606: Sure thing and as of now , I'm sure if l go to eden university and as soon as l finish my degree the career will be waiting for me, isn't a good thing mr Austin
2/2/24, 11:48 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: It is indeed a good thing but what makes me less confident is the reputation of the degree
2/2/24, 11:48 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As I told, it is a university at the bottom of the ranking
2/2/24, 11:49 AM - +263 77 799 6606: Ooooh so you saying all those people doing medicine there will have difficulties in finding jobs since the university has low rank
2/2/24, 11:50 AM - +263 77 799 6606: May you kindly share with me the ranking of universities in India for medicine and engineering
2/2/24, 11:53 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: That is right Themba, and I am speaking from a wider perspective, where you can be employed internationally. Just imagine you are running a hospital. Would you prefer  graduates from the best ranked Universities or the lowest onces?
2/2/24, 11:56 AM - +263 77 799 6606: Of course best ranked university, and can you share with me edoofians who are working in India after there graduate

2/2/24, 1:34 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As per your understanding, how many Laboratories, eye clinics, heart checkup clinics or Physiotherapists in your place?
2/2/24, 1:35 PM - +263 77 799 6606: Not quite sure but there should be many
2/2/24, 1:36 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: The last time I had a conversation from a parent from Zimbabwe, she mentioned there are very few and that too at distant places!
2/2/24, 1:37 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Moreover, they are expensive beyond the reach of common people, is that true?
2/2/24, 1:38 PM - +263 77 799 6606: Will also do my research but I'm sure that's it
