6/1/24, 1:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Parents of Prayer,

I am *Mr. Shivjeet, and I serve as the Admission Officer at Edoofa.* I wanted to extend my heartfelt wishes to you and your family for a prosperous and fulfilling 2024. 

I firmly believe that with the commencement of this new year, comes the promise of fresh beginnings, guiding the way for the actualization of one's deepest dreams and aspirations. As we stand on the threshold of this promising year, I am filled with excitement for the adventures it holds.
6/1/24, 1:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the same spirit, I would like to share that I am embarking on a journey as I prepare myself to pursue my doctorate and take a step forward in my academic pursuits. This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.
6/1/24, 1:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The decision to transition to a new phase in my life presents an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of students, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience remain enriched and fulfilling.

As I embark on this new journey, I want to assure you that I have entrusted your application file to capable hands. From this point forward, your admission journey will be seamlessly guided by one of our accomplished admission officers, *Ms. Siddhi,* who will connect with you on Tuesday.  I hope you will make yourself available for further procedures and will give your best to your career.
6/1/24, 1:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments. Wish you all the best, and God Bless.

Regards,
Mr. Shiveet
Edoofa Admission Team.
6/1/24, 1:38 PM - +263 78 694 4518: Thank you
8/1/24, 1:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Prayer,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honoured to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
8/1/24, 1:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
8/1/24, 1:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 1:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
8/1/24, 5:24 PM - +263 77 352 7223: Thank you all the best in your future endevours
8/1/24, 5:38 PM - +263 77 352 7223: Thank you very much looking forward for your guidance
8/1/24, 5:39 PM - +263 77 352 7223: You are talking to Prayer l lost my phone and currently using my mothers phone
9/1/24, 8:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are welcome, dear. I am happy to be here to support you.

A new year brings forth a multitude of possibilities and fresh opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practise more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?
9/1/24, 6:22 PM - +263 77 352 7223: So far l have no changes but if l have any l will surely notify you
9/1/24, 6:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It's absolutely fine not to set any New Year's resolutions; concentrating on refining your current situation can be equally impactful and worthwhile.

Now, I would like to shift focus to your admission process. As per your application file, it seems that you were unable to proceed with your admission formalities scheduled for August 2024. Since a few months have passed, and this is our first interaction, I would like to inquire why you were unable to do so and if now is the right time for you to focus on your university admission journey for higher education abroad.
9/1/24, 7:42 PM - +263 77 352 7223: I think this is the right time now.Last time i was at a boarding school and i  was concentrating with my examinations.Now iam available.
9/1/24, 7:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, Prayer. I would like to schedule a session for tomorrow at 8:00 AM to discuss the further application process in detail. Does that work for you?
10/1/24, 8:15 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good morning, dear. How are you today?
10/1/24, 6:37 PM - +263 77 352 7223: Prayer lost her phone 2 days ago she was using mine to communicate with you.As from tomorrow she will be having her own phone.
11/1/24, 8:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good morning. Thank you for sharing this information with me. May I know if she is available today to continue with our discussion regarding her admission procedure?
16/1/24, 8:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Prayer,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. I was hoping to get a response from your end following my previous messages. However, in recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 8:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 8:06 PM - +263 78 694 4518: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 8:06 PM - +263 78 694 4518: How are you doing
17/1/24, 9:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Prayer.

Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
17/1/24, 9:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am doing well, dear. Thank you for asking. I hope you are doing well too. Kindly allow us some time to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, we will reconnect with you to discuss the next steps in your academic journey.
17/1/24, 9:27 PM - +263 78 694 4518: Okay thank you
17/1/24, 9:27 PM - +263 78 694 4518: Thank you so much 😁💯

22/1/24, 11:25 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Greetings dear parent and Prayer
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence, I request you to come online at *11:30 am CAT tomorrow* and notify on this platform so that I can guide you ahead.
23/1/24, 5:09 AM - +263 78 694 4518: How are you
23/1/24, 11:48 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Day dear parent and Prayer
Hope you are doing well

As informed yesterday, I am here to guide you further in your university registration process. 

Are you ready to begin?
23/1/24, 11:48 AM - +263 78 694 4518: Yes
23/1/24, 11:59 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: It is good to hear from you, Prayer!
23/1/24, 11:59 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 11:59 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 12:01 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: *Congratulations on your excellent A-level results* At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you are yet to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students. I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  

So are you actively available to begin the session?
23/1/24, 12:01 PM - +263 78 694 4518: Thank you so much
23/1/24, 12:24 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: You are most welcome! Prayer
23/1/24, 12:24 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

23/1/24, 12:24 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I am shocked to compile these data for the Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities in Zimbabwe.

*Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE)* -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - *($680 per term)*

*Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT)* https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - *($535 per term)*

*University of Zimbabwe (UZ)* -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm *($523 per term)*

NUST -*($870 per term)*

*I am sure you and your family must have also discussed this,*. So what have you decided for your future ahead?
23/1/24, 12:25 PM - +263 78 694 4518: We have discussed to continue with edoofa
23/1/24, 12:39 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: This is well noted, Prayer!
23/1/24, 12:41 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 12:41 PM - +263 78 694 4518: Umm that's nice
23/1/24, 12:41 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: *Let me share with you that all students who are in India have gone through what you might be experiencing now. There was a stage of uncertainty and confusion where we guided them as Career Counsellors to ensure our learners fulfill their aspirations!*
23/1/24, 12:43 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
23/1/24, 12:44 PM - +263 78 694 4518: No
23/1/24, 12:44 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 12:45 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Therefore, It is important to know the facts of Edoofa's guidance and uniqueness compared to the normal University approach.

1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
23/1/24, 12:45 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 12:45 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

23/1/24, 12:45 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: These are aspects that no other organization or University possesses as of now, I hope you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you? <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 12:45 PM - +263 78 694 4518: Let me go through
23/1/24, 12:49 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Sure Prayer!
23/1/24, 1:19 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Prayer, have you gone through?
24/1/24, 6:12 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Prayer, I have been looking forward to hearing from you
24/1/24, 6:12 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>

24/1/24, 9:45 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Morning Prayer and family! 

*Education is the most powerful weapon you can use to change the world- Nelson Mandela*

With this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
24/1/24, 9:46 AM - +263 78 694 4518: Morning how are you....yes we can begin
24/1/24, 9:56 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good to hear from you, Prayer!
24/1/24, 9:56 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Have you gone through the details?
24/1/24, 9:57 AM - +263 78 694 4518: Yes l have
24/1/24, 10:07 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelor of Computer Applications and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
24/1/24, 10:09 AM - +263 78 694 4518: Accurate
24/1/24, 10:15 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
24/1/24, 10:25 AM - +263 78 694 4518: Ohhh ohky
24/1/24, 10:25 AM - +263 78 694 4518: Can you please shed light on the registration fee
24/1/24, 10:27 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
24/1/24, 10:27 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: .
24/1/24, 10:27 AM - +263 78 694 4518: Okay
24/1/24, 10:28 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 
Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
24/1/24, 10:28 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee that you pay will be subtracted from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.
24/1/24, 10:28 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
24/1/24, 10:30 AM - +263 78 694 4518: Yes it's clear
24/1/24, 10:36 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Do you have any questions for me as of now?
24/1/24, 10:41 AM - +263 78 694 4518: No l don't
24/1/24, 10:51 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Alright Prayer, It is really crucial to reserve your University seat with the completion of the registration fees. So I have made a special request to our Academic Board and a recommendation for you to be reconsidered at the earliest. May I know, how far is your family prepared towards the University registration fee as of now?
25/1/24, 6:25 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Prayer, I have been looking forward to hearing from you please
25/1/24, 6:25 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: What happened?
25/1/24, 7:37 AM - +263 77 352 7223: Hie how are you which University is she going to and how much is needed

31/1/24, 4:06 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I am having a good time
Please note that after this stage, Prayer will be receiving Offer Letters where the scholarship percentage and cost of education will be mentioned. You will be guided through the details
