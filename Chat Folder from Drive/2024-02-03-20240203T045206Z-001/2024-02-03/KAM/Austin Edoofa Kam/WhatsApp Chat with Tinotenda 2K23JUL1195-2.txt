12/1/24, 6:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tinotenda,

I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
12/1/24, 6:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
12/1/24, 6:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
13/1/24, 3:28 AM - +263 77 582 5214: Despite the loss of our family Aunt that transpired on December 12, we managed to start the year on a fair note. We hope it is going to be a very good year for us as a family for it's the same year we are expecting our dear Son, Tinotenda his journey to study abroad which we expect to be a game changing experience. We would want to extend our gratitude to you and the organization for also remembering us during this season. Thank you very much. Stay blessed now and forever.
13/1/24, 11:18 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Tinotenda.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing your thoughts and experiences with me. I'm deeply sorry to hear about the loss of your Aunt on December 12. The passing of a loved one is always a challenging time, and I hope you find comfort and strength in each other as a family during this period of mourning.
13/1/24, 11:20 AM - Kirti Edoofa: It's heartening to hear that despite this loss, you've started the new year with a sense of hope and positivity. The anticipation of Tinotenda's journey to study abroad is indeed an exciting prospect and a significant milestone for your family. I have no doubt that this will be a transformative experience for him, opening doors to new opportunities and learnings that will enrich not only his life but also bring pride and joy to your family.
13/1/24, 11:20 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I am truly grateful for your kind words of appreciation towards our organization and myself. It's an honor to be a part of your journey and to have the opportunity to support you during both the highs and lows.
13/1/24, 1:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond, since it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect on Monday to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation Monday.
22/1/24, 11:32 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Greetings dear parents and Tinotenda
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence, I request you to come online at *2:00 pm CAT tomorrow* and notify on this platform so that I can guide you ahead.
23/1/24, 2:19 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Day dear parents and Tinotenda

We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

1/2/24, 10:02 AM - +263 77 152 4484: Ok l have go through them
1/2/24, 10:13 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
1/2/24, 10:16 AM - +263 77 152 4484: I don't know why sir
1/2/24, 10:30 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
1/2/24, 10:30 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Therefore, It is important to know the facts of Edoofa's guidance and uniqueness compared to the normal University approach.

1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
1/2/24, 10:30 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
1/2/24, 10:30 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

1/2/24, 10:30 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
1/2/24, 10:31 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: These are aspects that no other organization or University possesses as of now, I hope you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?
1/2/24, 10:32 AM - +263 77 152 4484: Let me go across them
1/2/24, 10:38 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Sure Tinotenda
1/2/24, 12:49 PM - +263 77 152 4484: Yes sir
1/2/24, 12:52 PM - +263 77 152 4484: I have read the text
1/2/24, 12:52 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelor of Business Administration and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
1/2/24, 12:53 PM - +263 77 152 4484: That's exactly what it is
1/2/24, 1:04 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
1/2/24, 1:06 PM - +263 77 152 4484: As l receive the offer letter l will pay a certain amount which will be subtracted from my first term fee
1/2/24, 1:07 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: That is correct, Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
1/2/24, 1:08 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counseling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program *as I will be recommending your application for a higher quantum of scholarship.* Congratulations on the same. Now, let us assume,
1/2/24, 1:08 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*

4. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
1/2/24, 1:08 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education ($1650-$1000= $650) and this remaining fee of $650 is supposed to be paid within 3 days of arrival.
1/2/24, 1:08 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
1/2/24, 1:08 PM - +263 77 152 4484: In addition the amount will be about 500 to 750 us dollar
1/2/24, 1:10 PM - +263 77 152 4484: Yes sir
1/2/24, 1:12 PM - +263 77 152 4484: Since my intake is going to be in August this year, when do l expect to get my offer letter
1/2/24, 1:13 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: You will be receiving the offer letter from next week itself as you will need enough time to prepare for your higher education
1/2/24, 1:14 PM - +263 77 152 4484: Ok l will be waiting
1/2/24, 1:20 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Sure Tinotenda, do you have other questions for me as of now?
1/2/24, 1:21 PM - +263 77 152 4484: As for today l'm done
1/2/24, 1:22 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Noted, Tinotenda
It is really crucial to reserve your University seat with the completion of the registration fees. So I have made a special request to our Academic Board and a recommendation for you to be reconsidered at the earliest. May I know, how far is your family prepared towards the University registration fee as of now?
1/2/24, 1:25 PM - +263 77 152 4484: Let me inform my father that we had a session such that he will be able to reply on behalf of our family
1/2/24, 1:30 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Sure Tinotenda
1/2/24, 1:31 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I understand that you are interested in this golden opportunity to study in India under the given Scholarship. I do realize that your Family Members may have other concerns and this is the reason I have requested our Program Director Mr. Abhinav to spare some time to talk to your father about this. Shall I share the schedule with you?
