16/1/24, 11:50 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Proud Edoofians,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 11:50 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
17/1/24, 7:35 AM - +267 71 996 941: Thank you for your interest in my A-level results. As far as am concerned  , I have already provided you with my results from last year. If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to let me know.😊
17/1/24, 9:05 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning parents and Mercy.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for letting me know that, if you have already shared then it is alright please, since the results were out we were reaching out to our all students so please do not worry you can ignore the message above.
17/1/24, 9:07 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly allow us time till Monday. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, Mr. Austin, the senior career counselor at Edoofa will connect with you to guide you on the next steps in your academic career.
22/1/24, 2:18 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Day, dear parents and Mercy
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence I request you to come online at the earliest and notify me so that I can guide you ahead.

31/1/24, 2:25 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.

May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
31/1/24, 2:29 PM - +267 71 996 941: following ✍️
31/1/24, 2:30 PM - +267 71 996 941: I'm sorry to say that I wasn't able to complete the payments due to a financial crisis we had some family issues to solve. I appreciate your consideration and I'm grateful for the opportunity you've given me. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. <This message was edited>
31/1/24, 2:34 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I can understand, Mercy and how are you planning to proceed with your higher education?
31/1/24, 2:42 PM - +267 71 996 941: I'm still committed to pursuing my education and I'm exploring my options for alternative sources of funding or any other financial aid opportunities. I'm determined to complete my education and I appreciate your understanding and support.l hope l haven't made you wait for too long
31/1/24, 2:53 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I understand Mercy and I am here with an exclusive opportunity understanding your challenges. I will be making a special recommendation for a higher quantum of scholarship considering your challenges which would lessen the costs even than that of Zimbabwe and further through  the EWYL program, students can even self finance their higher education
31/1/24, 2:54 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: So, do you wish to learn more about the opportunity?
31/1/24, 3:11 PM - +267 71 996 941: following sir✍️
31/1/24, 3:11 PM - +267 71 996 941: yah l wish to
31/1/24, 3:14 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Great, do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

31/1/24, 4:56 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?

1/2/24, 9:31 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Morning Mercy and family, 
I hope you are doing well

As scheduled yesterday, I a here for the session. Are you ready?
1/2/24, 10:21 AM - +267 71 996 941: all set
1/2/24, 10:31 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Alright Mercy!
1/2/24, 10:31 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with the same
1/2/24, 10:31 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
1/2/24, 10:31 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Therefore, It is important to know the facts of Edoofa's guidance and uniqueness compared to the normal University approach.

1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
1/2/24, 10:31 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
1/2/24, 10:31 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

1/2/24, 10:31 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
1/2/24, 10:31 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: These are aspects that no other organization or University possesses as of now, I hope you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?
1/2/24, 10:53 AM - +267 71 996 941: following
1/2/24, 10:59 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelor of Arts-Bachelor of Legislative Law and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
1/2/24, 11:25 AM - +267 71 996 941: verified ✅
1/2/24, 11:30 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
1/2/24, 11:44 AM - +267 71 996 941: hmm due to the pressure ,stress and the tension of the situation l forgot some .l guess it will be best if you remind me
1/2/24, 12:14 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I understand Mercy, *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
1/2/24, 12:15 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counseling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program *as I will recommend your application for a higher quantum of scholarship.* Congratulations on the same. Now, let us assume,
1/2/24, 12:15 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*

4. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
1/2/24, 12:15 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education ($1650-$1000= $650) and this remaining fee of $650 is supposed to be paid within 3 days of arrival.
1/2/24, 12:15 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
1/2/24, 1:03 PM - +267 71 996 941: following
1/2/24, 1:05 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Do you have any questions for me as of now?

1/2/24, 1:11 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: It is really crucial to reserve your University seat with the completion of the registration fees. So I have made a special request to our Academic Board and a recommendation for you to be reconsidered at the earliest. May I know, how far is your family prepared towards the University registration fee as of now?
1/2/24, 1:25 PM - +267 71 996 941: maybe after knowing how much is to be paid ,we will then discuss and know how much prepared are they
1/2/24, 1:30 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: You can address the query based on this exams, Mercy
1/2/24, 1:30 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: This is because I have raised a special recommendation for you

Shall I share the schedule with you?
