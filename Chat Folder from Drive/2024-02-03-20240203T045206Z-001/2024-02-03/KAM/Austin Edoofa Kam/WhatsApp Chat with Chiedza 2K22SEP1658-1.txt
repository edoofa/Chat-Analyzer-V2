I hope this message finds you well. In regards to my previous messages, I wanted to share that I am looking forward for our discussion today regarding your admission journey. I am here at the scheduled time and am looking forward to our conversation. Please let me know if you are available for the discussion.

I am genuinely excited and eagerly awaiting your response.
16/1/24, 11:59 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Chiedza,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 11:59 AM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*

If you remember well, I hosted the counselling sessions at Regina Mundi High School and for Chiedza from which we have many students who are currently proceeding with their University registration process through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
18/1/24, 1:10 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: First of all congratulations to Chiedza on this exceptional achievement and I appreciate your support and efforts for her career. *The time has come when you have to now make rational decisions for your child's career to give the best opportunities to build a bright future*
18/1/24, 1:46 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: This means, education should not just focus on quality, but also come with holistic development of the child with affordability, which is one of the major challenges faced by you now. I was also doing basic research on the fee structure of a few Universities in Zimbabwe and this is the *term fee* that I found from the University websites.

Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE) -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ ($680 per term)
Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT) https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - ($535 per term)
University of Zimbabwe (UZ) -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm ($523+ per term)
NUST -$870 per term
18/1/24, 1:48 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: The cost of *Accommodation, Food, Wifi, stationaries, gadgets, transport* etc is additional. The initial registration fee ranges from $20-$75 without the guarantee of being eligible or not. The attachment fee before graduation ranges from $200 or more. Let me tell you, I was caught in surprise when I compared with Edoofa Scholarship Program and let me tell you why!
