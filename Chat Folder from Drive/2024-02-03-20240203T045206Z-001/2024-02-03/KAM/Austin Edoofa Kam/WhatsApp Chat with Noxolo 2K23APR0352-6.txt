I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
8/1/24, 2:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
8/1/24, 2:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 2:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
9/1/24, 3:43 AM - +263 77 903 7390: Well understood Ms Siddhi ,I am proud to hear those good news I am so excited.

9/1/24, 8:44 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is my pleasure, dear. It is so good to hear that your new year started off happily.

A new year brings forth a multitude of possibilities and fresh opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practise more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?
10/1/24, 11:27 AM - +263 77 903 7390: This year  my plan is to give my daughter a chance to do her driving lessons
10/1/24, 4:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great, ma'am. Engaging in driving lessons can be immensely beneficial, providing a structured and educational approach to acquiring essential driving skills and ensuring road safety.
10/1/24, 4:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: On this note, I would like to shift focus to your admission process. As per your application file, it seems that you were unable to proceed with your admission formalities scheduled for August 2024. Since a few months have passed, and this is our first interaction, I would like to inquire why you were unable to do so and if now is the right time for you to focus on your university admission journey for higher education abroad?
16/1/24, 10:23 AM - +263 77 903 7390: Most of the times I have netwok challenges that's were I fail to attend the sessions on time for I am in rural areas
16/1/24, 10:26 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good morning, parents and Noxolo. May I know how you all are doing today?
16/1/24, 10:39 AM - +263 77 903 7390: Morning ,we are doing very well .thanks for asking
16/1/24, 10:39 AM - +263 77 903 7390: How are you and your family
16/1/24, 8:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Noxolo,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. I am doing well, thank you for asking. However, in recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 8:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
18/1/24, 10:54 PM - +263 77 903 7390: A very good evening to you all ,I am doing well.together with my family

22/1/24, 11:30 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Greetings dear parents and Noxolo
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence, I request you to come online at *2:00 pm CAT tomorrow* and notify on this platform so that I can guide you ahead.
23/1/24, 2:19 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Day dear parents and Noxolo

As informed yesterday, I am here to guide you further in your university registration process. 

Are you ready to begin?

23/1/24, 2:43 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: *Congratulations to Noxolo on the excellent performance in all A-level subjects*, At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you are yet to complete the University registration process while Noxolo being a bright student and I still remember her passion for career and goals. I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand her calibre.  

So are you actively available to begin the session?
23/1/24, 4:37 PM - +263 77 903 7390: I am active to begin the sessions ,Good to here those good news from you .Thank you so much

We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

25/1/24, 4:13 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I am glad to hear that and you can discuss with them to learn their experiences!
25/1/24, 4:13 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like your child are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
25/1/24, 4:49 PM - +263 77 903 7390: Ithink the reason is that they dont plan ahead for their future or they dont know the importance of higher education
25/1/24, 6:45 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: That is correct
25/1/24, 6:45 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 6:45 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Therefore, It is important to know the facts of Edoofa's guidance and uniqueness compared to the normal University approach.

1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
25/1/24, 6:45 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 6:45 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

2/2/24, 3:30 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Indeed, Noxolo!
2/2/24, 3:30 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: You can address the same
2/2/24, 3:35 PM - +27 78 066 8102: I think that fees is very high costing in Zimbabwe and that is why students from this side are applying for Edoofa scholarship which helps them to get to their tertiary education at an affordable price
2/2/24, 3:38 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: That is right and we understand the same!
2/2/24, 3:39 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
2/2/24, 3:41 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *Bachelor of Science in Medical Lab Technology* and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
2/2/24, 3:45 PM - +263 77 903 7390: That's great ,Iam proud of them
2/2/24, 3:46 PM - +263 77 903 7390: Very accurate sir
2/2/24, 3:52 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
2/2/24, 4:30 PM - +27 78 066 8102: I'm very excited to hear that sir and l'm really looking forward to get a place in a university in India
2/2/24, 4:31 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: That is a great aspiration, Noxolo
2/2/24, 4:31 PM - +27 78 066 8102: Thank you sir
2/2/24, 4:33 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with the understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
2/2/24, 4:34 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counseling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program *as I will be recommending your application for a higher quantum of scholarship.* Congratulations on the same. Now, let us assume,
2/2/24, 4:34 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*

4. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
2/2/24, 4:34 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education ($1650-$1000= $650) and this remaining fee of $650 is supposed to be paid within 3 days of arrival.
2/2/24, 4:34 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
2/2/24, 5:03 PM - +27 78 066 8102: Everything thing is understood sir
2/2/24, 5:28 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Noted Noxolo
2/2/24, 5:28 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I see that you are interested in this golden opportunity to study in India under the given Scholarship. I do realize that your Family Members may have other concerns and this is the reason I have requested our Program Director Mr. Abhinav to spare some time to talk to your parent about this. Shall I share the schedule with you?
2/2/24, 5:42 PM - +27 78 066 8102: Yes please do share the schedule
