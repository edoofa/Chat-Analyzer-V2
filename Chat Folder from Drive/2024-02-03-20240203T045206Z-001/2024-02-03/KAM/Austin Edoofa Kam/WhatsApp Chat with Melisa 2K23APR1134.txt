16/1/24, 11:07 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Melisa,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 11:07 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
22/1/24, 11:36 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Greetings dear parent and Melisa,
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence, I request you to come online at *2:00 pm CAT tomorrow* and notify on this platform so that I can guide you ahead.

2/2/24, 10:01 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student.

I understand the financial situation and I am here to guide you in the best way possible. Are you ready for the same?
2/2/24, 10:02 AM - +263 71 813 7664: Yes I'm ready
2/2/24, 10:03 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Great!
2/2/24, 10:03 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

*I am sure you and your family must have also discussed this,*. So what have you decided for your future ahead?
2/2/24, 10:08 AM - +263 71 813 7664: We was planning to pursue my studies next year so we save some money this year because right now we're not really financially stable

2/2/24, 11:16 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
2/2/24, 1:47 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Melisa, are we connected please?
