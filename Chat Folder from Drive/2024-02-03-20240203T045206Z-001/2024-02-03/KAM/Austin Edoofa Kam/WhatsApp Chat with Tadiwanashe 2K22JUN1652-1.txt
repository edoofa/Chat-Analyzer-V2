I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey. <This message was edited>
16/1/24, 10:43 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further? <This message was edited>

22/1/24, 12:08 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: *Congratulations on your exemplary A-level results @263787149505* At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students. I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  So, are you available to begin? <This message was edited>

25/1/24, 5:36 AM - +263 78 714 9505: Hello, sorry for the inconveniences
25/1/24, 5:50 AM - +263 78 714 9505: Thank you Sir, I am available

25/1/24, 9:32 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Morning Tadiwanashe
How are you today? <This message was edited>
25/1/24, 9:36 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I understand, are you available now?
25/1/24, 10:13 AM - +263 78 714 9505: Available
25/1/24, 10:22 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good to hear from you, Tadiwanashe!

May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
25/1/24, 10:30 AM - +263 78 714 9505: Many reasons, including the section of the offer letter that said "A level results pending, submit before completion of registration"
25/1/24, 11:06 AM - ~ Dr Tadiwanashe Hopemore Mawere added +44 7592 314122
25/1/24, 12:09 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I can understand Tadiwanashe and I will be guiding you through the further proceedings with the best opportunities!
25/1/24, 12:09 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: At the same time, do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.
25/1/24, 12:09 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Therefore, It is important to know the facts of Edoofa's guidance and uniqueness compared to the normal University approach.

1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
25/1/24, 12:09 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 12:09 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

25/1/24, 12:10 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: These are aspects that no other organization or University possesses as of now, I hope you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?
25/1/24, 1:00 PM - +263 78 714 9505: Yes
25/1/24, 1:12 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelor of Science in Medical Lab Technology and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
25/1/24, 1:20 PM - +263 78 714 9505: Yes dear
25/1/24, 1:32 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
26/1/24, 8:00 AM - +263 78 714 9505: The fee paid to reserve a seat in India and is paid upon receiving the offer letter from the University
1/2/24, 1:01 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Day Tadiwanashe!
1/2/24, 1:02 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
1/2/24, 1:02 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,
1/2/24, 1:02 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 
Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000 

This means this registration fee that you pay will be subtracted from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.
1/2/24, 1:02 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
1/2/24, 5:39 PM - +263 78 714 9505: Yes please
2/2/24, 6:05 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
2/2/24, 9:35 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Morning to you all!
How are you today?
2/2/24, 1:04 PM - +263 78 714 9505: Okay, good day
2/2/24, 1:05 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good to hear from you, Tadiwanashe!
May I know the cause of low participation in the sessions?
2/2/24, 1:25 PM - +263 78 714 9505: Good
2/2/24, 1:30 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Can you please address the same?
2/2/24, 1:49 PM - +263 78 714 9505: Poor network connection due to harsh weather conditions
2/2/24, 1:50 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I understad and is the network better now?
2/2/24, 1:55 PM - +263 78 714 9505: There
2/2/24, 1:57 PM - +263 78 714 9505: I believe so
