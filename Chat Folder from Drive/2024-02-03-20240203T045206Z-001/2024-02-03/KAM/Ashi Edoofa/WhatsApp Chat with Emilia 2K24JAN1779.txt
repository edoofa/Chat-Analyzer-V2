31/1/24, 2:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
31/1/24, 2:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
31/1/24, 2:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

31/1/24, 2:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
31/1/24, 2:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?

31/1/24, 2:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
31/1/24, 2:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
31/1/24, 2:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
31/1/24, 2:52 PM - +263 71 828 0118: Very clear

31/1/24, 2:53 PM - +263 71 828 0118: Let's start
31/1/24, 2:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
31/1/24, 2:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them.

31/1/24, 3:58 PM - +263 71 828 0118: From video one,the founders of Edoofa were ellaborating on how Edoofa made tertiary education affordable and accessible for many African students and thus through the scholarship program,and they also mentioned  again about scholarship guidance through the Earn While you Learn program which will make education much accessible.On video 2,,the founders of Edoofa were saying that Edoofa's vision is not just to get a student admitted into school but it's visionis to try to make students employable.On the fourth video which is the preparation for Interactive Sessions with School,,the founders were highlighting on the S.O.P( Statement Of Purpose) and they were saying that the SOP has to convince the school about someone's strengths and why someone has chosen a particular course,and why he/she wants to do it on that particular school
31/1/24, 4:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263718280118 , that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
31/1/24, 4:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
31/1/24, 4:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
31/1/24, 4:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
31/1/24, 4:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
31/1/24, 4:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
31/1/24, 4:04 PM - +263 71 828 0118: Very clear Ms Ashi
31/1/24, 4:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
31/1/24, 4:06 PM - +263 71 828 0118: We are on the same page Ms😁
31/1/24, 4:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
31/1/24, 4:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier.

1/2/24, 12:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Emilia, Wishing you a good day!
1/2/24, 12:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In regards to the above forms and document,  I assume you have completed all the forms we shared with you. Please let us know if you have submitted the forms so we can proceed with your journey. If you have successfully submitted the forms, kindly share them with us so we can update our records.
1/2/24, 12:41 PM - +263 71 828 0118: Qsn2:Is there such a thing as a social structure that constraints individual action ,or is society nothing more than a figment of our imaginations?Please elaborate your answer.                                       Answer:.              Social structure ,in sociology ,is the distinctive ,stable arrangement of institutions whereby human beings in society interact and live together.All societies are designed to constrain individual behavior to that permitted by the group.Societies are constructed to make rules individuals need to conform to for acceptance .Societies are not imaginary structures because they are control mechanisms for group Dynamics.Social structures constrain the choices of individuals and ,in so doing,they limit ,guide and shape their behavior.Social structures have a significant impact on individual behaviour and can be thought of as constraints on individual action for example,the economic system in a society can shape the opportunies and resources that are available to individuals ,which in turn can influence their behavior and choices.Moreso,a person's location in the social structure (his or her social class,social status,the roles he or she plays and the culture,groups and social institutions to which he or she belongs)underlies his or her perceptions, attitudes and behavior ,thus societies are not just imaginary structures .
1/2/24, 12:41 PM - +263 71 828 0118: Qsn 3:Please explain the relation between Sociology and Economics.                    Answer: Economics is an age _old institution used to deal with the changing patterns in society.Sociology deals with the relationship between humans and society.Economics helps understand the pattern of want and consumption of resources .The focus of study in sociology is society and the behavior of humans in society.Economics and sociology are dependent on each other for their study . Economics ,as it is mainly concerned with man's economic aspects,is also directly correlated to society's social activities.Similary,sociology is concerned with study of social beings, economic factors highly impact it.The relationship between social progress is complex and dependent on decision made by governments on the importance of social progress,this ranges from welfare state with high levels of social spending to totalitarian regimes run by elites with low levels of spending on health and education ..Moving on,there is also what we call economic sociology,which is a subfield of sociology that studies economic phenomena.Economic sociologists conceive of economic actors as socialized, economic institutions , conceptualizing firms and markets as social systems . Embedded ness,relational work,and performativity are three important strands of economic sociology.
1/2/24, 12:41 PM - +263 71 828 0118: Qsn4:What is the role of institutions in society_do they perform positive functions or simply work in the interests of the powerful and against the powerless? Elaborate with examples.       Answer:.        Institutions are a part of the social order of society and they govern behavior and expectations of individuals,while at the same time they regulate business operations and ethics.In fact,the morality of institutions is guaranteed by the process of social evolution.The role of institutions in society is complex and multifaceted.While some institutions may perform positive functions such as maintaining social order, providing essential services and promoting collective well_being,others may indeed work in the interests of the powerful and against the powerless.     Social institutions help individual citizens learn how to behave in all kinds of different situations ,from what to wear while attending different religious marriage ceremonies to driving in traffic and the laws they must obey.The family, education and religion are all key institutions of society.The family socialize and teach individuals society's norms and values.Religion also plays a positive function in the sense that it preaches about how people may be rewarded after departing Earth,thereby teaching people to desist from doing bad and evil.However, religion also act as a weapon of the powerful to manipulate the powerless in the sense that some religious sects have turned women into men's properties and all they talk about is submissiveness.Also,the ruling class use religion as a weapon of manipulation in the sense that they encourage the poor to remain poor and live an unbearable life,,saying that after the struggles on Earth,they will enter the kingdom of heaven so,all in all, institutions perform positive functions to a greater extent
1/2/24, 12:41 PM - +263 71 828 0118: Qsn5: Explain primary and secondary groups as the two sociological groups and elaborate with examples about in_groups and out _groups as subtypes of primary and secondary groups.       Answer:.     The primary group is usually made up of significant others_those individuals who have the most impact on our socialisation.The best example of a primary group is the family.Secondary groups are often larger and impersonal .They may also be task focused and time limited.A primary group is a small group based largely on long _term face to face interaction and typically based on affiliation,such as a family or a friendship group.A secondary group is one based on shared goals or interests in which the members are rarely if they ever in face_to face contact with each other.The secondary groups include impersonal, temporary relationships that are goal oriented ,for example , business partners ,they can only be in contact , planning on business and after the profit ,some may part ways and focus on their own life.Primary group (family in particular)is a long term face to face interaction  and it helps in developing the total person through socialisation.

With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
1/2/24, 1:50 PM - +263 71 828 0118: Yes
1/2/24, 1:51 PM - +263 71 828 0118: Noted
1/2/24, 1:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Tuesday (09-Feb-2024).
1/2/24, 1:52 PM - +263 71 828 0118: It's fine
1/2/24, 1:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Tuesday, as previously agreed upon.

To kick start the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

https://chat.whatsapp.com/CWsJ1v0j2OkKYLVEMvZ6t0
1/2/24, 1:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Emilia Shamiso Sitete, and my EWYL group name is Emilia EWYL23E1233. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on Tuesday (09-Feb-2024) to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
1/2/24, 1:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
1/2/24, 1:54 PM - +263 71 828 0118: Noted
1/2/24, 1:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BA (Sociology)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
1/2/24, 2:01 PM - +263 71 828 0118: Yes,the information is accurate
1/2/24, 2:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
1/2/24, 2:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
1/2/24, 2:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
1/2/24, 2:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
1/2/24, 2:05 PM - +263 71 828 0118: Yes,it's not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities
1/2/24, 2:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
1/2/24, 2:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
1/2/24, 2:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
1/2/24, 2:12 PM - +263 71 828 0118: Yes,Mr Gurvinder mentioned everything
1/2/24, 2:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
1/2/24, 2:14 PM - +263 71 828 0118: Yes,we are on the same page
1/2/24, 2:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*
1/2/24, 2:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
1/2/24, 2:16 PM - +263 71 828 0118: Yes,that's quite understandable
1/2/24, 2:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
1/2/24, 2:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
1/2/24, 2:23 PM - +263 71 828 0118: Noted
1/2/24, 2:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
1/2/24, 2:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
1/2/24, 2:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
1/2/24, 2:26 PM - +263 71 828 0118: Very clear
1/2/24, 2:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
1/2/24, 2:28 PM - +263 71 828 0118: It's quite clear,I don't have any question
1/2/24, 2:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
1/2/24, 2:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
1/2/24, 2:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
1/2/24, 2:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
1/2/24, 2:32 PM - +263 71 828 0118: Wow!I can't wait to become an Edoofan
1/2/24, 2:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
1/2/24, 2:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
1/2/24, 2:34 PM - +263 71 828 0118: Yes,Ms Ashi , I am excited to know the news
1/2/24, 2:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
1/2/24, 2:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
1/2/24, 2:36 PM - +263 71 828 0118: Yes Ms,,I am aware
1/2/24, 2:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
1/2/24, 2:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
1/2/24, 2:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for February 15, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before February 15, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by March 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
1/2/24, 2:39 PM - +263 71 828 0118: I have followed the details and it's quite clear
1/2/24, 2:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
1/2/24, 2:43 PM - +263 71 828 0118: I have been following all the information you have just sent about the admission fees process and it's quite clear,, I don't have any query
1/2/24, 2:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
1/2/24, 2:45 PM - +263 71 828 0118: I am very excited for the next steps
1/2/24, 2:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
1/2/24, 2:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.
1/2/24, 2:47 PM - +263 71 828 0118: Thank you ,,if I have any question I will ask
