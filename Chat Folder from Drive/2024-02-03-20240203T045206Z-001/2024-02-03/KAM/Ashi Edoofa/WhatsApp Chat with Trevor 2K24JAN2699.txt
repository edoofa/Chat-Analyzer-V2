31/1/24, 8:02 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Thank you for the opportunity and I’m pleased to get to tell you about myself.

I’m a 25 year old male bachelor of accounting honors university graduate hoping to further my studies in the field of accounting. 

I’m interested in physical exercise which I engage in on a daily basis at dawn. It has helped me cope with a lot over the years and not only because of the direct impact it has had in making me feel fit but also in the community of fellow runners and fitness enthusiasts like me that I encounter when I go out. 

As for the family, we are Zimbabweans and I have always stayed with my two parents and my younger sister in Harare. My mother is a teacher and my father is retired.

My aunt is my sponsor for this journey and her and my parents have been my biggest influencers all the way.
31/1/24, 8:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your story. It's inspiring to hear about your dedication to both academic and physical pursuits. The support of your family and your aunt as a sponsor speaks volumes about the strong foundation you have. Wishing you continued success in your accounting studies and your daily exercise routine.
31/1/24, 8:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward, I would like to bring an important aspect to your attention. The collective aim that we have for the student strongly values balanced involvement from parents, especially when the student is unable to participate. Your proactive engagement holds significant weight, and if, for any reason, either you or your guardians won't be available, we kindly request you to inform us beforehand so that we can plan and schedule our discussion beforehand. I hope you have taken note of this as well?
31/1/24, 8:07 PM - +263 77 763 6776: I have taken note and they have as well seeing as they are following up on the session as we proceed on their phones since they are in the group.
31/1/24, 8:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Fantastic! Now over the next four days, our focus as your admission team will be on equipping you with a comprehensive understanding of what lies ahead in your university admission journey and help you commence the same.
31/1/24, 8:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Soon after, we will guide you through the initiation of your EWYL Journey. The next batch of EWYL Sessions is scheduled to commence on Friday (February 09th) and hence, if we are able to focus and complete the Admission Process before Friday with pure consistency, you will be able to start your EWYL journey as well in a timely manner.
31/1/24, 8:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly mark this date on your calendar and ensure that you are available to complete the necessary procedures within the stipulated timeline. If everything is proceeding as planned so far, shall we move forward and begin our session for the day?
31/1/24, 8:10 PM - +263 77 763 6776: I’m taking note of the date and yes we may move forward
31/1/24, 8:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
31/1/24, 8:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Trevor 2K24JAN2699)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
31/1/24, 8:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Trevor EWYL23E1253)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.
31/1/24, 8:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
31/1/24, 8:23 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Yes it’s all clear
31/1/24, 8:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.
31/1/24, 8:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
31/1/24, 8:32 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Thank you for recognizing that
31/1/24, 8:36 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Well the idea of being able to earn scholarship credits that will go towards covering the completion of my education was something I commended.

I felt grateful for the program’s efforts to want all students to be able to work as they learn so as to get industry experience. I believe it goes a long way unlike only getting equipped with the classroom content.
31/1/24, 8:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for your kind words and feedback. We're thrilled to hear that you appreciate the mission and values of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. We are dedicated to making higher education accessible and affordable, and your success and satisfaction are our top priorities.

31/1/24, 8:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward with the procedures, I would like to share an insight with you. To ensure a seamless experience, we as a team, have prepared essential documents that not only value your feedback but also outline the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program and the application process. You will have to review, complete, and submit these documents as instructed. 

If you are ready, shall I share a brief overview of these documents for your ease?
31/1/24, 8:39 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Please share
31/1/24, 8:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Perfect! Let's delve into the documents that are crucial for your journey with Edoofa.

31/1/24, 8:49 PM - +263 77 763 6776: I have taken note
31/1/24, 8:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Along with these forms, I have asked you to share your academic documents with us. I am currently waiting for that as well.

Moving forward, as a part of your application file, you will need to visit your school and secure a letter of recommendation from them. We have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process.
31/1/24, 8:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, your subject combination for A Level exams, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
31/1/24, 8:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 8:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to inquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?
31/1/24, 9:03 PM - +263 77 763 6776: I believe in the next 7 days if they are available to assist me via email or other electronic means. 

If not, I’ll be letting you know before the 7 days passes when I’ll be able to visit the school to secure the recommendation
31/1/24, 9:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear. I am looking forward to getting an update from your end. I would also like to reiterate that our operational hours are from 12:30 PM to 8:30 PM, Central African Time.
31/1/24, 9:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Considering this, for our future sessions, you have to decide on an hour’s time that suits your availability within this timeframe and share the same with us so that we can tailor our subsequent sessions to accommodate your schedule effectively.

Hence, can you let me know at what time you would like us to schedule our sessions on a daily basis (from 12:30 Pm to 08:30 PM)?
31/1/24, 9:14 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Tomorrow 6pm
From Friday onwards 12:30pm
31/1/24, 9:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, in such a case, we will schedule tomorrow’s session at 6:00 pm. It's important to note that all three forms and your academic documents should be completed and submitted by tomorrow before our session.

1/2/24, 7:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
1/2/24, 7:07 PM - +263 77 763 6776: You’re welcome
1/2/24, 7:07 PM - +263 77 763 6776: We may start
1/2/24, 7:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
1/2/24, 7:09 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Alright
I’ve gone through the image
1/2/24, 7:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
1/2/24, 7:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
1/2/24, 7:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
1/2/24, 7:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
1/2/24, 7:15 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Yes
They are clear
1/2/24, 7:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
1/2/24, 7:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
1/2/24, 7:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
1/2/24, 7:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
1/2/24, 7:18 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Yes, I am following
It is very clear
1/2/24, 7:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
1/2/24, 7:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
1/2/24, 7:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
1/2/24, 7:20 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Alright.
1/2/24, 7:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
1/2/24, 7:21 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Yes, we may start
1/2/24, 7:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
1/2/24, 7:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
1/2/24, 7:23 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Yes we may
1/2/24, 7:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, Let me share the videos with you. I am sure you must be excited for the videos.

1/2/24, 7:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
1/2/24, 7:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
1/2/24, 7:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
1/2/24, 7:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
1/2/24, 7:29 PM - +263 77 763 6776: I can be done watching & formulating a summary of my understanding in an hour
1/2/24, 7:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing dear, Once you are done please do let me know
1/2/24, 7:35 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Alright, I will
1/2/24, 8:28 PM - +263 77 763 6776: I have managed to go through all the videos and firstly I have to applaud the wealth of information in these videos
1/2/24, 8:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to know that you were able to go through all the videos. If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are on the right path in your educational journey?
1/2/24, 8:32 PM - +263 77 763 6776: I believe the emphasis on being open minded coupled with the willingness to learn that was being shared in the videos is worth to make note of. 

It has definitely been imprinted in my mind just how important it is to do so as well as the ability to follow instructions  for a successful EWYL experience
1/2/24, 8:34 PM - +263 77 763 6776: I understood just how much the discipline to follow instructions can lead to a more successful experience in earning scholarship credits and a more satisfying Edoofa program enrollment process
1/2/24, 8:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
1/2/24, 8:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
1/2/24, 8:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
1/2/24, 8:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
1/2/24, 8:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
1/2/24, 8:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
1/2/24, 8:39 PM - +263 77 763 6776: I’ve also come to appreciate how much Edoofa makes it so much easier for students to earn real work experience as they learn.

The pride of being an Edoofian is another point to exclaim from the way it is conveyed in the videos. The Edoofa community helps all students interact with like minded students and a dedicated team to ensure a smoother process
1/2/24, 8:46 PM - +263 77 763 6776: I understood very well the intent of the videos and your clarity in pinpointing the takeaways from each video has solidified my understanding
1/2/24, 8:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
1/2/24, 8:47 PM - +263 77 763 6776: Yes, we are
1/2/24, 8:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
1/2/24, 8:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.
