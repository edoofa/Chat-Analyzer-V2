I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.
26/1/24, 1:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?

30/1/24, 2:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response dear
30/1/24, 2:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
30/1/24, 2:29 PM - +263 71 907 9653: Yes
30/1/24, 2:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 2:35 PM - +263 71 907 9653: Yae l go through it
30/1/24, 2:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
30/1/24, 2:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
30/1/24, 2:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
30/1/24, 2:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
30/1/24, 2:38 PM - +263 71 907 9653: Yeah it's clear
30/1/24, 2:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
30/1/24, 2:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
30/1/24, 2:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

30/1/24, 2:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct dear
30/1/24, 2:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
30/1/24, 2:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
30/1/24, 2:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
30/1/24, 2:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
30/1/24, 2:47 PM - +263 71 907 9653: Okay
30/1/24, 2:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
30/1/24, 2:50 PM - +263 71 907 9653: Yeah we can start

30/1/24, 2:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
30/1/24, 2:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually.

If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are on the right path in your educational journey?
1/2/24, 1:37 PM - +263 71 907 9653: But am not understanding it
1/2/24, 1:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No problem, Let me share the insights with you -
1/2/24, 1:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
1/2/24, 1:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
1/2/24, 1:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
1/2/24, 1:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
1/2/24, 1:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
1/2/24, 1:48 PM - +263 71 907 9653: Yeah now it's clear
1/2/24, 1:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
1/2/24, 1:50 PM - +263 71 907 9653: Yae we are on the same page
1/2/24, 1:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
1/2/24, 1:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

1/2/24, 1:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
1/2/24, 1:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
1/2/24, 1:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
1/2/24, 1:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the two tasks that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process. Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
1/2/24, 2:29 PM - +263 71 907 9653: I think tomorrow
1/2/24, 2:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 12:30 pm for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to fill out all the forms. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed day ahead and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
1/2/24, 2:32 PM - +263 71 907 9653: Okay thank you
1/2/24, 2:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome!

2/2/24, 12:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am fine thank you for asking
2/2/24, 12:42 PM - +263 71 907 9653: 2)Entrepreneurship had their impact on jobs and and economic growth .Productivity entrepreneurs can invigorate the economy by creating jobs and new technologies and increasing productivity .
Entrepreneurs are a rare species.Even in innovative_driven economies only 1-2% of the workforce stars a business in any given year .Yet entrepreneurs  ,particularly innovative entrepreneurs ,are vital to the competitiveness of the economy .
Entrepreneurship is important to economic development. The benefits yo society will be greater in economies where entrepreneurs can operate flexible  develop their ideas and reap the rewards . Entrepreneurs respond to high regulatory barriers by moving to more innovative - friendly countries or by turning from productive activities to non-wealth -creating activities.
Entrepreneurs are equally  ,if not more important when the economy is doing badly .When unemployment 
is high and the economy is contracting or stagnating ,dynamic entrepreneurship could help turn the economy around. By developing novel products new firms can boost demand ,which could inturn create new job opportunities and reduce unemployment. 
Entrepreneurs have positive employment effects and in the short and longterm and negative effects in the medium term
2/2/24, 12:44 PM - +263 71 907 9653: Yae but am still typing
2/2/24, 12:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear
2/2/24, 12:54 PM - +263 71 907 9653: 3)GAAP is the setoff accounting rules set forth by the financial accounting standards Board (FASB ) that U.S companies are expected to follow when putting together their statements  The goal of GAAP is to ensure that a company's financial statements are complete ,consistent and comparable .GAAP maybe contrasted with proforma accounting which is a non-GAAP financial reporting method .GAAP is used mainly in the U.S ,while most other countries follow the international financial reporting standards( IFRS).
GAAP is also used by states and other government entities in the US in preparing their financial statements. According to the financial accounting foundation ,all 50 states adhere to GAAP and many require that local entities, such as countries, cities ,towns and school districts do so as well .
Without GAAP comparing financial statements of different companies would be extremely difficult even within the same industry, making an apples -to-apples comparison hard .Some companies may use both GAAP and non-GAAP resources when reporting their financial results
2/2/24, 1:27 PM - +263 71 907 9653: 4) Accounting standards  ensure the financial statements form multiple companies are comparable .Because all entities follow the same rule , accounting standards make the financial  statements credible and allow for more economic decisions based on accurate and consistent information. 
It is mandatory for companies to follow accounting standards as it ensures uniformity in financial statement across the firms so that the investors ca undestand them easily and clearly and can take approprite decisions about the investment . They are also mandatory because they makes statements comparable with other organisation. 
The mandatory accounting standards includes As 9 for revenue recognition ,As 10 for accounting for fixed assets, As 11 the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates( revised 2003)to mention but a hand full
2/2/24, 1:40 PM - +263 71 907 9653: 5)Accounting is an art of orderly ,keeping the records of the monetary transactions and preparation of the financial statements of the company whereas auditing is an analytical task which involves the independent evaluation of the financial information to express an opinion on true and fair view.
-Accounting is governed by accounting standards and governed of auditing governs auditing 
-Accounting is a simplified task which is perfomed by the accountant but auditing is a complex task so auditors are required for performing it.
-The main purpose of accounting is to reveal the profitability position ,financial position and performance of the organisation conversely auditing is to check the correctness of the financial statement .
-Accounting is a continuous activity unlike auditing which is a periodic activity 
- Accounting starts where bookkeeping ends and auditing starts where accounting ends 
- Accounting is a continuous process that is day to day recording of transactions whereas auditing is a periodic process
2/2/24, 1:41 PM - +263 71 907 9653: Am done now
2/2/24, 1:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response regarding the SOP form and academic questions.  With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.
2/2/24, 1:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Friday (02-Feb-2024).
2/2/24, 1:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Friday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

https://chat.whatsapp.com/HzBRXqw6jj0K3LGoe5S4i7
2/2/24, 1:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Oprah Madziwa, and my EWYL group name is Oprah EWYL23E1212. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on Friday (02-Feb-2024) to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
2/2/24, 1:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
2/2/24, 1:43 PM - +263 71 907 9653: Always welcome
2/2/24, 1:44 PM - +263 71 907 9653: Okay
2/2/24, 1:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
2/2/24, 1:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 22nd February, 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
2/2/24, 1:45 PM - +263 71 907 9653: Yeah
2/2/24, 1:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.
2/2/24, 1:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is -*BCom* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
2/2/24, 1:50 PM - +263 71 907 9653: Yeah it's accurate
2/2/24, 1:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
2/2/24, 1:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
2/2/24, 1:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
2/2/24, 1:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
2/2/24, 1:56 PM - +263 71 907 9653: Yeah
2/2/24, 1:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
2/2/24, 1:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
2/2/24, 1:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
2/2/24, 1:58 PM - +263 71 907 9653: Yae
2/2/24, 2:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
2/2/24, 2:17 PM - +263 71 907 9653: Yeah
2/2/24, 2:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*
2/2/24, 2:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $1650). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
2/2/24, 2:32 PM - +263 71 907 9653: Yeah
2/2/24, 2:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1650 as per the above example.
2/2/24, 2:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1650 - $1000 = $650 . This amount can be paid in two installments of $325 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $325 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
2/2/24, 2:36 PM - +263 71 907 9653: Okay
2/2/24, 2:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
2/2/24, 2:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
2/2/24, 2:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
2/2/24, 2:42 PM - +263 71 907 9653: Okay l understand it
2/2/24, 2:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
2/2/24, 3:11 PM - +263 71 907 9653: So the example you are talking about is it my payment as well or it's just an example
2/2/24, 3:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, The example above shared is based on the experience we had however your fees break up will be shared with you when you will receive your offer letter
2/2/24, 3:17 PM - +263 71 907 9653: Okay
2/2/24, 3:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*.

This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students.

2/2/24, 3:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/2/24, 3:46 PM - +263 71 907 9653: Okay
2/2/24, 3:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.

Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
2/2/24, 3:52 PM - +263 71 907 9653: Yeah
2/2/24, 4:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
2/2/24, 4:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
2/2/24, 4:25 PM - +263 71 907 9653: Yeah
2/2/24, 4:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
2/2/24, 4:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
2/2/24, 4:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for February 15, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before February 15, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by March 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
2/2/24, 4:27 PM - +263 71 907 9653: Ah not yet
2/2/24, 4:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
2/2/24, 4:29 PM - +263 71 907 9653: No
2/2/24, 4:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process?
