25/1/24, 11:11 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
25/1/24, 11:11 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
25/1/24, 11:11 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
25/1/24, 11:13 AM - +263 77 974 1606: Very  clear
25/1/24, 11:14 AM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-

This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
25/1/24, 11:14 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
25/1/24, 11:14 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
25/1/24, 11:23 AM - +263 71 899 7085: Yes
25/1/24, 11:23 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
25/1/24, 11:23 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
25/1/24, 11:23 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
25/1/24, 11:23 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
25/1/24, 11:26 AM - +263 71 899 7085: Following

Here,  the student displays her unique strengths,vision, academic prowess and gives justice justication to these. Student are being encouraged to be resourceful and diligent when they fill out the form
25/1/24, 7:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263779741606 , that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
25/1/24, 7:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
25/1/24, 7:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
25/1/24, 7:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
25/1/24, 7:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
25/1/24, 7:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
25/1/24, 8:00 PM - +263 77 974 1606: Agreed
25/1/24, 8:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
25/1/24, 8:07 PM - +263 77 974 1606: We are together
25/1/24, 8:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
25/1/24, 8:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

29/1/24, 12:24 PM - +263 71 899 7085: 2) Business process management life cycle

29/1/24, 12:25 PM - +263 71 899 7085: 3) how does Business
 contribute to economic development . please elaborate and state with an example
Businesses can contribute to economic development in a number of ways. One way is by creating jobs and opportunities for economic growth. For example, a new business might open a factory and hire local workers, providing them with an income and helping to boost the local economy. Businesses can also contribute to economic development by investing in infrastructure, such as roads and utilities, and by paying taxes that fund public services. They can also create demand for other businesses, such as suppliers and service provider .  Also businesses can contribute to economic development is by creating value for consumers. For example, a company might develop a new product or service that improves the quality of life for its customers. Or, it might develop a more efficient way of producing goods, which can lower prices and improve living standards. When businesses create value for consumers, they help to stimulate economic growth and improve the standard of living in the local community.

29/1/24, 12:47 PM - +263 71 899 7085: 4) explain with an example from you life which shows managerial talent or skills
One example of my managerial skills is from when I helped to organize a community project in my hometown. I worked with a group of volunteers to clean up a local park, and I was responsible for coordinating the project and making sure it ran smoothly. I had to manage a team of people, communicate with the city government, and handle logistics like ordering supplies and setting up the event. It was a challenging project, but I was able to use my managerial skills to make it a success.
29/1/24, 12:47 PM - +263 71 899 7085: 5) explain the importance of human resources in an organization
Human resources is a vital function of any organization. HR professionals are responsible for recruiting and hiring employees, onboarding new hires, managing benefits and payroll, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations. They also play a key role in developing and implementing policies and procedures that affect the entire organization. Without a strong human resources department, an organization would have difficulty attracting and retaining talented employees, and it would be more likely to experience legal and regulatory issues.   Also, - boosting productivity and efficiency - . HR can improve productivity and efficiency by:
- Providing training and development opportunities for employees.
- Creating clear job descriptions and performance expectations.
- Implementing effective performance management systems.
- Using technology to streamline processes.
- Encouraging a collaborative work environment.
- Fostering a culture of continuous improvement.
All of these things can contribute to a more productive and efficient workplace, and HR plays a key role in making them happen. Furthermore,   reducing employee turnover. One way HR can reduce employee turnover is by focusing on employee engagement. Engaged employees are more likely to be satisfied with their jobs and less likely to leave. HR can promote engagement through initiatives like:
- Regular performance reviews and feedback.
- Offering career development opportunities.
- Providing recognition and rewards.
- Holding regular employee surveys.
- Promoting a healthy work-life balance.
These are just a few examples of how HR can help to create an environment where employees feel valued and engaged, which can lead to lower turnover rates.
