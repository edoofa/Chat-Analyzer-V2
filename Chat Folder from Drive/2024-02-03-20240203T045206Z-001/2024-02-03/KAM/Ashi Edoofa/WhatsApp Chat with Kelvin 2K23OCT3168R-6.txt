20/12/23, 1:39 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, dear parent and my dear student!

I would like to share an update with you: starting today, I will no longer be serving as your admission officer. I wanted to inform you that Ms. Ashi will be taking over from now on, and she will be reaching out to you very soon.

Over the past 12 months, I have had the privilege of serving as the admission officer for you and many other students. It has been a great experience getting to know the potential of my students and spending valuable time discussing their aspirations. However, every journey has its end, and now it's time for me to embark on a new chapter.

Rest assured, the exceptional service and support you have received will continue seamlessly as Ms. Ashi, one of our accomplished admission officers, takes over your admission journey from this point forward. I wish you the very best on your journey. Goodbye, my dear student.

Yours sincerely,
Mr. Shivjeet
Admission Officer
20/12/23, 5:28 PM - +263 77 707 4506: "Dear Mr. Shivjeet,
Thank you for your heartfelt letter and for all the hard work and dedication you have shown over the past year. I have appreciated your guidance and support, and I wish you all the best in your future endeavors. I am confident that Ms. Ashi will continue to provide excellent service and support, and I look forward to working with her in the future.

26/12/23, 2:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kelvin ,

In light of the conversation we had earlier, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you are ready for the discussion today. I am here at the scheduled time to have a discussion about your academic journey futher. With this said, May I know if you are available for the conversation ?

I am eagerly waiting for your response.
26/12/23, 4:46 PM - +263 77 376 1475: I am very sorry for late respond I was having network problems.iam kelvin manzungu's parent
26/12/23, 4:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries dear, Let's start the session now. <This message was edited>
26/12/23, 4:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
26/12/23, 4:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
26/12/23, 4:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
26/12/23, 4:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
26/12/23, 5:27 PM - +263 71 783 4941: Is it possible for us to continue tomorrow after a fully read it
26/12/23, 5:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @263717834941. We can reconnect tomorrow at 2:00 pm, have a good day ahead!
27/12/23, 10:16 AM - +263 78 946 8248 joined using this group's invite link
27/12/23, 1:27 PM - +263 71 783 4941: Yes we can go ahead
27/12/23, 1:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning @263717834941, Wishing you a good day!
27/12/23, 1:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: May I know if we can continue with the session now?
27/12/23, 1:32 PM - +263 71 783 4941: We are well madam.
Yes we can go ahead with the session
27/12/23, 1:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation @263717834941, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan - <This message was edited>
27/12/23, 1:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
27/12/23, 1:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.
27/12/23, 1:40 PM - +263 71 783 4941: Thanks for that I have read and understand it
So as for now what should kelvin do
27/12/23, 1:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @263717834941, I am glad to know that you have understood the above benefit. As of now, there is nothing which Kelvin has to do please, however we are yet to discuss rest of the benefits. Shall we continue with them?
27/12/23, 1:42 PM - +263 71 783 4941: Yes you can continue
27/12/23, 1:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
27/12/23, 1:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
27/12/23, 1:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/12/23, 1:52 PM - +263 71 783 4941: Yes I have understand what you have explained about how safeguard is my child's fees is as far as increments are consider.
27/12/23, 1:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3.*Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
27/12/23, 1:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/12/23, 1:56 PM - +263 71 783 4941: Yes it resonate with me
27/12/23, 1:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
27/12/23, 1:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
27/12/23, 1:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before December 30, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by January 30, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
27/12/23, 2:05 PM - +263 71 783 4941: Let's say at my work place iam being paid on the last day of the month is it possible for me to pay on that day I get my pay
27/12/23, 2:06 PM - +263 71 783 4941: Which will be after the deadline
27/12/23, 2:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263717834941 It's important to complete the registration process by the given deadline please, however It might be possible that you may get the deadline for the month end please.
27/12/23, 2:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
27/12/23, 2:09 PM - +263 71 783 4941: Okay noted
27/12/23, 2:10 PM - +263 71 783 4941: Yes you can provide us with more information on it
27/12/23, 2:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
27/12/23, 2:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
27/12/23, 2:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
27/12/23, 2:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
27/12/23, 2:37 PM - +263 71 783 4941: Thanks for the informative information
27/12/23, 2:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
27/12/23, 2:40 PM - +263 77 707 4506: Yes
27/12/23, 2:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
27/12/23, 2:41 PM - +263 77 707 4506: Yes I agree with you
27/12/23, 2:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
27/12/23, 2:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
27/12/23, 2:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
27/12/23, 2:44 PM - +263 77 707 4506: Yes I'm clear
27/12/23, 2:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
27/12/23, 2:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
27/12/23, 2:49 PM - +263 77 707 4506: Yes I'm clear with it
27/12/23, 2:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
27/12/23, 2:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
27/12/23, 2:56 PM - +263 77 707 4506: OK
27/12/23, 2:57 PM - +263 77 707 4506: Clear
27/12/23, 3:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/12/23, 3:08 PM - +263 77 707 4506: Yah I have a query on the issue of EWYL program, I was told that I was supposed to begin on the second of this month but I did not
27/12/23, 3:09 PM - +263 77 707 4506: And on the issue of the cost of admission process I don't no

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
6/1/24, 1:00 PM - +263 77 707 4506: Good afternoon mom
6/1/24, 1:07 PM - +263 77 707 4506: So my first question is on the deadline of the registration  fee they just say 15 days of working hours
6/1/24, 1:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your query with us, As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
6/1/24, 1:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
6/1/24, 1:10 PM - +263 77 707 4506: OK so let's begin our discussion
6/1/24, 1:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
6/1/24, 1:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) What's your Miscellaneous and Uniform Fee (applicable for first year only) ?
4) What's your University Related and Examination fee [Per annum] ?
5) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
6/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 77 707 4506: Annual tertiary - 1100         Registration - 1000.          Uniform fee - 100.               Exam fee 25.                   Accommodation - 700 normal room
6/1/24, 2:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, please, as you can see in your offer letter from the Quest Group of Institutions, after the scholarship your per annum tuition fee is $1100.
						
Along with this, there is a $50 fee covering the university's regular examination fee, your library fee, and ERP Fee, along with other basic expenses such as the Wi-Fi facility. When you add this $50 to the per annum tuition fee of $1000, the total comes out to be $1150.
6/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 77 707 4506: Yes
6/1/24, 2:12 PM - +263 71 783 4941 joined using this group's invite link
6/1/24, 2:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me also brief you on the accommodation as well:  The on-campus accommodations at the Quest campus have different categories and the pricing for every room is different as mentioned in your offer letter.
6/1/24, 2:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: If a student wishes to get a more affordable accommodation, they can stay off-campus as it is a lot cheaper and they get more freedom. The university officials will help you find off-campus accommodations and help you settle in after you report to the campus.
6/1/24, 2:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: If you opt for accommodation outside the Campus, it would be comparatively cheaper, the cost will be around $600 per annum and that would include your food cost as well which means you would have to pay only $30 to $40 per month towards your living expenses making your per annum educational cost $1150  + $600 = $1750. I hope you are clear about this?
6/1/24, 2:23 PM - +263 71 783 4941: As for the admission fee can I pay half of the amount in the 15 working days and the other half in 30 days as you once stated
6/1/24, 2:28 PM - +263 71 783 4941: It's registration fee
6/1/24, 2:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes dear, I am glad to see that you remember this conversation. Please don't worry I will share the information with you soon.
6/1/24, 2:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
6/1/24, 2:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
6/1/24, 2:37 PM - +263 71 783 4941: Yes it's clear on that .my worry is on the registration fee as you once said it can be splited into two halfs but on the admission form they said it is needed in 15 days time
6/1/24, 2:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263717834941 Kindly don't as there is indeed the payment plan for the registration fees. On the offer letter, The instructions are written for all the students as the benefit of paying the registration fees in installment if for edoofians.
6/1/24, 2:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $1150 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $1150 - $1000 = $150 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?

6/1/24, 2:57 PM - +263 71 783 4941: <Media omitted>
6/1/24, 3:00 PM - +263 77 707 4506: Yes I'm clear
6/1/24, 3:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand that the university process the same offer letter for every student. Hence, It's written that the registration fees must be paid within 15 days. Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days. However, Being Edoofians you have the benefit to pay this fee in installment. <This message was edited>
6/1/24, 3:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
6/1/24, 3:08 PM - +263 77 707 4506: Yes
6/1/24, 3:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $900 of the registration fee. This $900 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $450 before the first deadline date of *January 19th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $450 before the second deadline date of *February 19th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
6/1/24, 3:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $900 within 15 working days, before January 19th, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
6/1/24, 3:09 PM - +263 71 783 4941: Okay now I have understand you madam
6/1/24, 3:10 PM - +263 71 783 4941: Thank you for the explanation
6/1/24, 3:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @263717834941, Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
6/1/24, 3:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
6/1/24, 3:17 PM - +263 71 783 4941: Yes I reside in harare
6/1/24, 3:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
6/1/24, 3:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
6/1/24, 3:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
6/1/24, 3:27 PM - +263 71 783 4941: Thanks for help 
We will contact him so that we get in touch with him
6/1/24, 3:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
6/1/24, 3:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
6/1/24, 3:35 PM - +263 71 783 4941: This message was deleted
6/1/24, 3:36 PM - +263 71 783 4941: I thank that one for Mr Rajan is most welcome due to the transfer rate which is reasonable
6/1/24, 3:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @263717834941, Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
6/1/24, 3:44 PM - +263 71 783 4941: No queries at the moment
6/1/24, 3:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into the Quest Group of institutions.
