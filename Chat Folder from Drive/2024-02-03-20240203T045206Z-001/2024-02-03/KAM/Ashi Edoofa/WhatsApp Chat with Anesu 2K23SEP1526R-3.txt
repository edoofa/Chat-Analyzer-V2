18/12/23, 1:35 PM - You joined using this group's invite link
12/1/24, 6:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Anesu,

I hope this message finds you well. I am Ms. Ashi. It has been a while since we last connected, and I wanted to take this opportunity to share some exciting news with you. Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the *Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'* 

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career. <This message was edited>
12/1/24, 6:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.


We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams.
12/1/24, 6:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence, I wanted to reach out to you today to share a glimpse of the conference, and I hope you too are excited to attend such events when you come to India.

With that in mind, I wanted to share some crucial updates received from the university officials concerning your admission journey, particularly regarding the awaited offer letter. Could you please confirm if you are available to proceed with this discussion?
12/1/24, 8:56 PM - +263 78 125 6089: Yes
12/1/24, 8:57 PM - +263 78 125 6089: A level results are out and l am happy to share them with you
12/1/24, 8:58 PM - +263 78 125 6089: <Media omitted>
12/1/24, 8:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Congratulations on your outstanding achievement! Your hard work, dedication, and perseverance have paid off, and you should be proud of yourself. Your success is a testament to your talent and skills, and it opens up many opportunities for you. 

This is a time to celebrate your achievements and reflect on the journey that led you here. We appreciate your efforts and shall update the admissions team about your results. Best of luck in all your future endeavors!
12/1/24, 9:00 PM - +263 78 125 6089: Oky thank you
12/1/24, 9:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear,
12/1/24, 9:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I trust you remember our last conversation on 6th of November, where we discussed the formalities the admission team was handling for your university admission. To ensure we are on the same page, let me recap what the team has been working on since then.

Following our last session, we submitted your application to multiple universities for scholarship consideration. However, as some time had passed without receiving any updates from the university officials, I personally took the initiative to inquire about the status of your application, which was submitted on 10th of November.
12/1/24, 9:03 PM - +263 78 125 6089: Oky any luck?
12/1/24, 9:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Upon requesting an update from the university officials, we learned that the eligibility criteria for the *B.Tech (Mechanical Engineering)* course had been revised in accordance with government guidelines for the August 2024 academic intake. While your documents were evaluated, the universities found you eligible for the scholarship. However, due to changes in government guidelines, you were not ineligible for the course B.Tech (Mechanical Engineering)
12/1/24, 9:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: According to the updated eligibility criteria, students need to have studied Chemistry in their A-levels to pursue the  B.Tech (Mechanical Engineering). Unfortunately, as you did not have the required subject, they indicated that you are currently ineligible for the program.
12/1/24, 9:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Since these updates, the team has been actively working to find a solution for you. We engaged in detailed discussions with the university officials to address this situation. As a team, our goal has been to ensure that you can pursue a course aligned with your career interests. 

With the grace of God, we were able to find a solution, and we would like to share the highlights of our discussion and the solutions we have explored for you. If we are together, shall I share the same solution with you?
12/1/24, 9:10 PM - +263 78 125 6089: Yes please share
12/1/24, 9:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: After engaging in discussions with university officials and the academic board, we are pleased to inform you that we have identified a solution that not only allows you to pursue your desired course but also emphasizes the significance of selecting the right career path.
12/1/24, 9:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The university officials highlighted that the foundational subjects for all engineering courses are the same in the first year of education. Recognizing the importance of helping you bridge the gap created by your initial subject combination, they assessed your eligibility for the course B.Tech (Computer Science Engineering), which is highly sought-after in the 21st century.
12/1/24, 9:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As a result, you will embark on the journey of pursuing B.Tech Computer Science Engineering in your first year. If, in the second year, you decide to revert to your original course, you can do so by changing your major. Alternatively, should you discover a growing interest in Computer Science Engineering, you can seamlessly continue in that field.
12/1/24, 9:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We believe that this solution aligns with your career goals and will enable you to stay on track effectively. We wanted to share this update with you and are eager to hear your thoughts on this matter?
12/1/24, 9:36 PM - +263 78 125 6089: That will work l guess
12/1/24, 9:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that @263781256089, May I know if we can apply your application for  B.Tech Computer Science Engineering  ?
12/1/24, 10:02 PM - +263 78 125 6089: Yes
12/1/24, 10:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation, we will move ahead with your application accordingly
12/1/24, 10:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Have a blessed night ahead!

Please let me know your availability, and we can plan accordingly to make our future interactions smoother and more productive.

15/1/24, 2:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response, As you mentioned that you have done some research about the course. Would you like to share your insights with us ?
15/1/24, 2:25 PM - +263 78 125 6089: I think it could be easier for me to do the course if l had computer science
15/1/24, 2:26 PM - +263 78 125 6089: So l was thinking maybe l should do another course instead
15/1/24, 2:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know @263781256089, As you mentioned that it would be easy for you to pursue B.Tech (Computer Science and Engineering) if you had a computer in your academics. Let me share that what you are thinking is correct however in the first year you will learn all the basics which will help you in building the base for the computer science. The teachers who have been teaching Computer Science in the first year do make sure to make the new student familiarize with the computer fundamentals. 

Hence, You will not need to have Computer Science in your academics dear, as you will be having guidance with you, right ?
15/1/24, 2:33 PM - +263 78 125 6089: Yes l understand
15/1/24, 2:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Now in order to make sure that we will update the university officials. please write a mail to "*academicboard@edoofa.com*" stating that you had a discussion with your admission officer Ms. Ashi about changing your course from B.Tech (Mechanical Engineering) to B.Tech (Computer Science Engineering) and that you have finalized the same for yourself after discussion with your parents and they support you in this discussion of yours. 

Please also mention your admission group name in the mail and once done please share the screenshot with me here.
15/1/24, 2:43 PM - +263 78 125 6089: Ms Ashi l wanted to know if there other courses l might do
15/1/24, 2:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: May I know which course you want to pursue dear ?
15/1/24, 2:53 PM - +263 78 125 6089: Actuarial science
15/1/24, 3:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about your interest, Regarding the same, I would like to let you know that our career counselors here at Edoofa analyze the student's academic background first and then recommend the course, if you want to pursue Actuarial science for your education and have a career in the same. In that case, B.com is the foundation as you should first complete a course in the field of commerce since that forms a base for you to have a professional career in  Actuarial Science Field. 

I would encourage you to not involve yourself in self-research as it will complicate your understanding more.
15/1/24, 3:06 PM - +263 78 125 6089: Oky maybe l should just stick to B. Tech
15/1/24, 3:10 PM - +263 78 125 6089: <Media omitted>
15/1/24, 3:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure dear, Thank you for sharing the above screenshot, I will make sure that the email is received to officials.
15/1/24, 3:20 PM - +263 78 125 6089: Oky thank you
15/1/24, 3:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear, Have a blessed day ahead!
15/1/24, 3:21 PM - +263 78 125 6089: Same to you
16/1/24, 10:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Anesu,

17/1/24, 11:59 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Anesu,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
17/1/24, 11:59 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly. 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
17/1/24, 12:45 PM - +263 73 319 1048: Afternoon how are you
17/1/24, 12:51 PM - +263 73 319 1048: Yes l have gone through it
17/1/24, 12:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am fine @263733191048, thank you for asking.  As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
17/1/24, 12:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
17/1/24, 12:53 PM - +263 73 319 1048: Yes you can go ahead
17/1/24, 1:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Gulzar Group of Institutions, rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
17/1/24, 1:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
17/1/24, 1:20 PM - +263 73 319 1048: 1)1400
2)1200
3)7750
17/1/24, 1:21 PM - +263 73 319 1048: 3)750 correction👆
17/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly, you are absolutely correct. I would like to provide some additional details regarding your offer letter from the Gulzar Group of Institutes. As you can see, following the scholarship, your annual tuition fee amounts to $1400.

In the first year, it is compulsory for students to select on-campus hostel accommodation, primarily because the university needs to complete their Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) formalities. However, from the second year onwards, students have the flexibility to choose off-campus housing if they prefer, as they would have become more familiar with the area and likely formed connections with their classmates.
17/1/24, 1:34 PM - +263 73 319 1048: Its fine
17/1/24, 1:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Gulzar Group of Institutes places a strong emphasis on student safety as a top priority. To ensure that students have an affordable and comfortable living experience in the hostels, the university has designed its accommodations with the well-being of the students in mind costing $1200. 

The hostel rooms are four-seaters and come equipped with air conditioning. Importantly, the cost of accommodation also covers the expenses for the food/mess service, which includes three meals a day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) for each student.
17/1/24, 1:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, the university intentionally assigns roommates to students to foster a supportive and communal atmosphere, enabling students to rely on their peers for assistance and companionship. 

This approach enhances the overall living experience and contributes to a sense of security and camaraderie within the student community. I hope you have taken note of this and this clarifies the tuition fee and the accommodation facilities for you?
17/1/24, 2:02 PM - +263 73 319 1048: I understand but is the hostel fees paid once or as per semester
17/1/24, 2:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263733191048 Please don't worry I will assist you regarding the same soon. In light of this, let us move forward with our discussion. As you are now familiar with your annual fee at Gulzar Group of Institutes, let me outline the various facilities and services covered by the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living/Accommodation Costs
3. Food Costs
4. Library Fee
5. 24-Hour Wifi Access
6. Maintenance Fee
7. Water Bill
8. Electricity Bill <This message was edited>
17/1/24, 2:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: These components collectively make up the comprehensive package that you will receive as part of his university fee, ensuring a well-rounded and hassle-free educational experience. I hope we are together so far and this resonates with you?
17/1/24, 2:35 PM - +263 73 319 1048: Yes we are together
17/1/24, 2:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we have established the tuition fee at $1400 and accommodation fee at $1200, making your total annual education cost $2600, let me guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. Through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
17/1/24, 2:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
17/1/24, 2:53 PM - +263 73 319 1048: It's clear
17/1/24, 3:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earn scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, he can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his annual fee, which is $2600. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2600 - $1000 = $1600, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.

This illustrates how you can effectively make his education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
17/1/24, 3:09 PM - +263 73 319 1048: Yes if he work hard it will be manageable
17/1/24, 3:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It's reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.

Having said that, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter.
17/1/24, 3:12 PM - +263 73 319 1048: Fine
17/1/24, 3:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As previously mentioned, the registration fee of $750 is not an additional cost; instead, it's a part of your first-year tuition fee. Therefore, it will be adjusted against the total fee of $2600 for the first year. 

Consequently, the remaining fee that you will be required to pay after [name] arrives in India will be $2600 - $750 = $1850. This amount can be conveniently paid in two installments of $925 and $925 , with a six-month gap between them.
17/1/24, 3:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The first installment can be paid either before your arrival in India or within three days of his arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.

I hope this information is clear and we both have a shared understanding of this arrangement?
17/1/24, 3:30 PM - +263 73 319 1048: I understand but the challenge there is of Visa and flight
17/1/24, 3:32 PM - +263 73 319 1048: Also the EWYL will apply when now it seems l will be paying the whole amount of 2600
17/1/24, 3:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your queries with me, Let me assist them that we will guide you regarding the Visa process and Flight Tickets before your arrival, Kindly don't worry about them. 

Regarding your query about EWYL, You can use scholarship credits from the first year please. Your EWYL mentor will assist you regarding the credits please.
17/1/24, 3:38 PM - +263 73 319 1048: I understand that you assist but my query of the amount to cover those two costs of Visa and flight
17/1/24, 3:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure dear, The cost of Visa is $83 which will be paid to the Embassy and the cost of flight tickets varies according to the demand although the average cost is between $450 - $550 please.
17/1/24, 3:46 PM - +263 73 319 1048: OK thank you
17/1/24, 3:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263733191048. In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on January 30th, 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
17/1/24, 3:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
17/1/24, 3:50 PM - +263 73 319 1048: Its fine
17/1/24, 3:50 PM - +263 73 319 1048: Yes you can explain
17/1/24, 3:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of January 30th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of February 29th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
17/1/24, 3:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before January 30th, 2024. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
17/1/24, 3:57 PM - +263 73 319 1048: Yes its clear l will pay in two installments
17/1/24, 3:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
17/1/24, 3:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
17/1/24, 3:58 PM - +263 73 319 1048: I stay in Harare
17/1/24, 3:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
17/1/24, 3:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
17/1/24, 3:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
17/1/24, 4:02 PM - +263 73 319 1048: OK its fine but does he give me proof of payment
17/1/24, 4:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
17/1/24, 4:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
17/1/24, 4:13 PM - +263 73 319 1048: You can send the details l am not finding them
17/1/24, 4:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
17/1/24, 4:20 PM - +263 73 319 1048: OK thank you
17/1/24, 4:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
17/1/24, 4:27 PM - +263 73 319 1048: Sorry to draw you back a little bit l am worried about the carrier now as he is going to embark on computer science engineering first.My query is will it be easy for him to revert to his initially selected program of mechanical engineering or it will be difficult to change program
17/1/24, 4:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263733191048 I hope you remember that the Anesu is not eligible for Mechanical Engineering according to the subject combination. Hence, It's not possible to pursue this course from the first year. However, If you want to do the same, you will be able to do so by opting Computer Science in the first year. May I know if you remember the same ?
