I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
12/1/24, 5:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
12/1/24, 5:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
16/1/24, 12:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Proud Edoofians,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

22/1/24, 12:43 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Recalling our counseling and evaluation sessions, I take pride in your qualification for our esteemed Edoofa Scholarship Program. Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
23/1/24, 9:30 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: let's schedule our discussion for tomorrow at 9 AM CAT. If you face challenges or need a different time, let me know in this group. Success often comes from open communication about concerns.

24/1/24, 8:12 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I see you have gone through my messages earlier but did not respond back, *please If there is something that is concerning you because of which you are not Proceeding ahead with your process, then I would request you to come forward and address the same with me here in the group so that I can provide you with a solution to cater to your issues and guide you with your admissions procedures.*

Since my working hours for the day are over now, *I have therefore scheduled your session for 09:30 AM CAT tomorrow*

I trust you are doing well. I've observed that my messages have been read but not responded to. In moments of silence, I'm reminded of Psalm 37:7 (NIV): "Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him." Is everything alright?
