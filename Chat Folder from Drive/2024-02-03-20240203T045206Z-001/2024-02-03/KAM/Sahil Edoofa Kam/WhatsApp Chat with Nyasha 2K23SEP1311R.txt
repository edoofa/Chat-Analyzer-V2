Hence I request you to come online and continue with your admission procedures.

31/1/24, 1:18 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats, however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge.  Having Conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

I'm sure you and your family have discussed this thoroughly. What decisions have you made for your future? Considering the cost and employment opportunities, have you compared the benefits of studying in India with the Edoofa program against other options?
31/1/24, 1:49 PM - +263 78 393 2102: Yes ,,tertiary education has become quite expensive here in Zimbabwe and what you are doing as Edoofq is quite remarkable to be honest ,,giving students a chance to pursue their dreams at such low prices and also preparing them for  employment . I was truly honored to have been given a shot at that
31/1/24, 1:51 PM - +263 78 393 2102: Yes we have discussed with the family and decided for me to take a gap year and maybe apply later on for 2025 hopefully then we would be in a better financial position .
