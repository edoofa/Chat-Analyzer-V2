16/1/24, 11:19 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Yvonne,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey. <This message was edited>
16/1/24, 11:22 AM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

16/1/24, 12:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
16/1/24, 12:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly allow us time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, Mr. Sahil, the senior career counselor at Edoofa will connect with you to guide you on the next steps in your academic career.
16/1/24, 12:14 PM - +263 71 388 1319: Okay.Thank you
22/1/24, 12:16 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good Day Yvonne ,

22/1/24, 12:17 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Recalling our counseling and evaluation sessions, I take pride in your qualification for our esteemed Edoofa Scholarship Program. Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
22/1/24, 4:31 PM - +263 71 388 1319: Good afternoon sir
22/1/24, 4:33 PM - +263 71 388 1319: I wasn't able to complete my admission because we are still looking for the money that is needed
23/1/24, 10:39 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Given that the A level results are now available, and many students are actively securing seats at universities, I trust your family is prepared to proceed with the registration process at the earliest convenience?
23/1/24, 10:41 AM - +263 71 388 1319: We are still looking for the money to proceed with everything
23/1/24, 10:51 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Given the missed deadline at one university, I'm keen to know the amount of funds your family has secured thus far.With the recent rise in university fees in Zimbabwe, it's important to understand that the current expenses to study in Zimabawe will surpass the cost of pursuing studies in India with the Edoofa Scholarship. If the opportunity is missed now by you, then your family might incur significantly higher costs in Zimbabwe. <This message was edited>
