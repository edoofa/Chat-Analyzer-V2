16/1/24, 10:58 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Moyo,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 10:58 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

16/1/24, 9:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
16/1/24, 9:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly allow us time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, Mr. Sahil, the senior career counselor at Edoofa will connect with you to guide you on the next steps in your academic career.

24/1/24, 8:47 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Recalling our counseling and evaluation sessions, I take pride in your qualification for our esteemed Edoofa Scholarship Program. Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
24/1/24, 10:34 AM - +27 64 128 8442: Good morning sir
After receiving the university letter we sat down and we discussed, the issue is that I'm the only one working and paying fees for children and supporting them financially and my salary is +-R4500 so it is not enough for me to take Nokwakha to India.
24/1/24, 10:35 AM - +27 64 128 8442: She will study in Zimbabwe but I'm not yet sure which university am I going to afford
24/1/24, 10:38 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I understand your situation, and I appreciate your openness in discussing it. Considering the financial constraints, have you had a chance to research the cost of studying locally in Zimbabwe?
24/1/24, 10:40 AM - +27 64 128 8442: Nokwakha did some of the research
24/1/24, 10:43 AM - +27 64 128 8442: So we are hoping that so far India failed we will manage MSU, unless if you have another way of helping her
24/1/24, 10:44 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Having Conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.
