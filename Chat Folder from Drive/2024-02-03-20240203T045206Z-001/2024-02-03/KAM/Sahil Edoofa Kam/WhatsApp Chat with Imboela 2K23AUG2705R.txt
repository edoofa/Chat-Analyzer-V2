I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.
