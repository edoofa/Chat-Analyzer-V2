15/1/24, 1:00 AM - +263 71 611 2479: Good evening mentors and directors it's Loccadia l will like to sincerely apologies for not being available for my sessions the reasons is l was away from home and l had lost my phone so l had anticipated by now l would have bought a new phone but the finances are not bulancing.

Now moving forward  l managed to pay the enrollment fee which was 350$ but  due to serious financial imbalance at home  l failed to secure a sit at Galgotious university it was not easy  we tried all we could but things are not going so good this time around  , considering that my father is the only one working and the pay is not enough to meet our expectations it made it difficult for me to obtain the amount that was needed in such a short period of time, .
Having an opportunity to study in India has always been my dream and l was willing to put my all in it and further my education by finance is my only barrier to do so . 
The Alevel results are out and my results are as follows 

History A
Sociology A
Ndebele Language A.

I was wondering if by any chance do you offer a fully funded scholarship, also l have been meaning to ask what happens to the 350 since l have failed to raise money to secure a sit in the university .
Again l apologize for the inconveniences that I have caused by my absence THANKYOU

Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
23/1/24, 9:30 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: let's schedule our discussion for tomorrow at 9 AM CAT. If you face challenges or need a different time, let me know in this group. Success often comes from open communication about concerns.

We can continue
29/1/24, 12:02 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Being a senior academic and counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.


*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?

I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
29/1/24, 12:07 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
