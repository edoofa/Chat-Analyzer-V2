24/1/24, 9:38 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Recalling our counseling and evaluation sessions, I take pride in your qualification for our esteemed Edoofa Scholarship Program. Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
24/1/24, 9:41 AM - +263 71 465 8373: My results for A level didn’t turn out well actually l had 2 points in one subject of which meaning l can’t qualify for BSc in Physiotherapy l guess
24/1/24, 10:39 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: May I know what effected your results ?
24/1/24, 11:39 AM - +263 71 465 8373: Actually l don’t know was quit surprised with my results

24/1/24, 2:15 PM - +263 71 465 8373: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 3:07 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: But what according to you can be possible reasons ?
24/1/24, 3:12 PM - +263 71 465 8373: I believe that l didn’t put enough effort and was over confident
24/1/24, 4:10 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: So what have you planned now ?

25/1/24, 12:45 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Considering your results, eligibility for a bachelor's program in Zimbabwe is not currently feasible. You have two available options: the first is to reappear for A-levels, and the second, which is often more suitable, is to begin with a diploma. Many students opt to commence with a diploma as it serves as a foundation for future bachelor's studies.
