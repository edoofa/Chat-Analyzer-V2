21/12/23, 12:32 PM - You joined using this group's invite link
16/1/24, 11:14 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Makanaka,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey. <This message was edited>
16/1/24, 11:15 AM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

16/1/24, 7:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
16/1/24, 7:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly allow us time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, Mr. Sahil, the senior career counselor at Edoofa will connect with you to guide you on the next steps in your academic career.

*I am Mr Sahil, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*

If you remember well, I hosted the counselling and evaluation sessions for you through the Edoofa Scholarship Program from which you have made me proud by qualifying for the program.

22/1/24, 12:15 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Recalling our counseling and evaluation sessions, I take pride in your qualification for our esteemed Edoofa Scholarship Program. Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
22/1/24, 12:47 PM - +263 78 271 9887: My parents  are struggling to get the money
22/1/24, 2:03 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Congratulations! For qualifying the Advanced Levels. The time has come when you and your family have to now make rational decisions as this is an impactful turning point in your career.
22/1/24, 2:11 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: What challenges are they facing now since your A level results are out ?
22/1/24, 5:36 PM - +263 78 271 9887: Thank you
22/1/24, 5:36 PM - +263 78 271 9887: Financial
23/1/24, 11:10 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I'm interested in understanding the funds your family has managed to secure until now, considering the missed deadline at one university. Given the recent increase in university fees in Zimbabwe, it's crucial to assess that current expenses exceed the cost of pursuing studies in India with the Edoofa Scholarship. Missing the opportunity now might result in significantly higher costs for your education in Zimbabwe, which I believe is not the desired by your family right ?
23/1/24, 11:10 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Here's a summary of the fee structures for some renowned public universities in Zimbabwe:
*Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE)* -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - *($680 per term)*
*Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT)* https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - *($535 per term)*
*University of Zimbabwe (UZ)* -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm *($523 per term)*
NUST -*($870 per term)*

23/1/24, 11:43 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Are you now prepared to secure your university seat? If I personally engage with the university to reinstate the seat that you couldn't secure earlier due to financial challenges.
23/1/24, 11:51 AM - +263 78 271 9887: Let me connect with my parents if they are now ready
23/1/24, 12:59 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Please have a call with your parents immediately, especially considering the current time where students are actively reserving seats after results, and scholarship opportunities have limited availability.
23/1/24, 2:55 PM - +263 78 271 9887: Yes
23/1/24, 2:57 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I do realize that your Family Members may have other concerns and this is the reason I have requested our Program Director Mr. Abhinav to spare some time to talk to your Parents about this. Shall I share the schedule with you?

1/2/24, 8:49 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning!
I trust you are doing well. I've observed that my messages have been read but not responded to. In moments of silence, I'm reminded of Psalm 37:7 (NIV): "Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him." Is everything alright?
1/2/24, 10:36 AM - +263 78 301 6196: Good morning to you
1/2/24, 10:45 AM - +263 78 301 6196: We are in different township so it's very hard to connect to each other because of network please be patient with us
1/2/24, 1:38 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I understand the challenges with network connectivity. Regarding scheduling a call with the Director, given the urgency in securing university seats and the limited availability of seats, when would it be convenient for one of the parents to have a call? Your active involvement is crucial, and I have already recommended a call with the Director based on our discussions. To effectively convey your enthusiasm and readiness to the board, active participation from the parents is vital. Please let me know when would be a suitable time for a call.
2/2/24, 9:18 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning! let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:
