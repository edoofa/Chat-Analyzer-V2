16/1/24, 11:29 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kudzi ,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 11:29 AM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

I am *Ms.Harmehak,Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction, I remembered that during our session you portrayed an enormous potential of becoming a leader of tomorrow. Hence I have asked my Colleague *Mr.Sahil, Senior Academician* @919821838532 to personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority. 

Hence I request you to come online and continue with your admission procedures.
24/1/24, 8:09 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I see you have gone through my messages earlier but did not respond back, *please If there is something that is concerning you because of which you are not Proceeding ahead with your process, then I would request you to come forward and address the same with me here in the group so that I can provide you with a solution to cater to your issues and guide you with your admissions procedures.*

Since my working hours for the day are over now, *I have therefore scheduled your session for 09:30 AM CAT tomorrow*

God Bless you,
Have a great day ahead!
