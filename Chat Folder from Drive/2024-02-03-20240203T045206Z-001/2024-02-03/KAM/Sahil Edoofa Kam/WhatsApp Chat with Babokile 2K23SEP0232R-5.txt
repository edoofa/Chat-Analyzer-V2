I trust this message reaches you in good health. I have been looking forward to the response from your side, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed for quite some time now. This has raised some concerns on my part, which is affecting your scholarship application. 

I am more than willing to continue with your journey, Hence I wanted to understand if there is something that is bothering you. If you're ready now, please let me know so that we can proceed with the discussion. If my understanding is correct, I am assuming that you have something that you want to share with us, right?
16/1/24, 12:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Babokile,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
29/1/24, 9:42 AM - Harmehak Edoofa: Good Day @263773881615 @263771039593 @263787077037 ⁩ , 

I am Ms.Harmehak,Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction, I remembered that during our session you portrayed an enormous potential of becoming a leader of tomorrow. Hence I have asked my Colleague Mr.Sahil, Senior Academician @919821838532 ⁩ to personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority. 

Hence I request you to come online and continue with your admission procedures.
29/1/24, 4:19 PM - +263 77 388 1615: Hello I am sorry I haven't been available for quite sometime 
Babokile did very well but unfortunately I don't think he will be able to enroll with you due to financial constraints
29/1/24, 4:20 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good Day , 
*I am Mr Sahil, Senior Academician at Edoofa* <This message was edited>
29/1/24, 4:20 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I personally noticed challenges in your admission process, so I'm here to help. Despite not being part of the admission team, as a member of the academic bench, I'll personally ensure your application is completed within three days, securing the maximum scholarship percentage possible .This will make your education more affordable than studying locally and open up maximum employment prospects. Trust me to handle everything, and let's start fresh for a successful outcome. As a dedicated effort, I'm providing you with the option to call me directly if there are any delays in the process.
29/1/24, 4:20 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
29/1/24, 7:58 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 9:53 PM - +263 77 388 1615: Ok thank you
30/1/24, 8:43 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Good morning Everyone!*  let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*"As the scriptures teach, knowledge is a steadfast companion. A person enlightened by wisdom is held in high regard across all realms. The brilliance of education surpasses the allure of beauty and the vigor of youth."*

 With positive energy, let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education. So shall we begin ?
30/1/24, 6:58 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I was anticipating your response today but unfortunately, you were not available all day. I look forward to your active participation tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT time. I am eager for our interaction. As we embark on a new day, let's reflect on the wisdom from Proverbs 3:5-6 (NIV): *'Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.'*
31/1/24, 10:17 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Good morning Everyone!*

*“It is impossible for a man to learn what he thinks he already knows.”*

With positive energy, let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education. So shall we begin ?
1/2/24, 8:47 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning!
I trust you are doing well. I've observed that my messages have been read but not responded to. In moments of silence, I'm reminded of Psalm 37:7 (NIV): "Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him." Is everything alright?
1/2/24, 10:52 AM - +263 77 388 1615: Good morning
1/2/24, 1:53 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Could you please provide an honest explanation for the delay in the process ? Given that A-level results are now available, there's a sense of urgency among students to secure places at top universities. The rapid filling of university seats is a common trend, and delays could limit options as the best opportunities are often claimed swiftly.
2/2/24, 3:37 AM - +263 77 388 1615: Good morning I am not sure whether its appropriate to call this 'delays' when I have already communicated that I could not proceed due to financial constraints
2/2/24, 8:44 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: This message was deleted
2/2/24, 8:45 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Please understand that as a member of the academic board, I hold some influence. If you openly share your concerns with me, especially specific details, I can personally assist you in securing a higher percentage of scholarship.
