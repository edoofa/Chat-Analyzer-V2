22/1/24, 12:29 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 12:29 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Recalling our counseling and evaluation sessions, I take pride in your qualification for our esteemed Edoofa Scholarship Program. Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
22/1/24, 12:42 PM - +263 78 423 3539: When we were given the offer letter all the parents the mother was not working and the father was the one footing all the family needs. The father's income was very little and we went a heard to look for sponsors and we couldn't find one. So as for now we are still hoping that she can still be enrolled in any other universities if there is any chance since l as the mother l am now earning something
22/1/24, 1:55 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Are you financially ready now to pay the registration fees?
22/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 78 423 3539: By mid February lwill manage to pay part of the fees
23/1/24, 8:38 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Since you missed the deadline once its crucial to understand the timelines now as results are out students are reserving the seats fast, Do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats, however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge.  Having Conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.
23/1/24, 8:58 AM - +263 78 423 3539: I am aware of that Anesu was fortunate to have the opportunity to have a scholarship with EDOOFA.

23/1/24, 3:36 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?

I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
23/1/24, 4:01 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 4:01 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments.
