I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
8/1/24, 1:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
8/1/24, 2:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life.

16/1/24, 7:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Dyllan,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. I was hoping to get a response from your end following my previous messages. However, in recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 7:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
29/1/24, 8:51 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good Day @263772738930 @263773776257 ,

29/1/24, 8:52 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Recalling our counseling and evaluation sessions, I take pride in your qualification for our esteemed Edoofa Scholarship Program. Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
29/1/24, 8:06 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 8:38 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Good morning Everyone!*  let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

 With positive energy, let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education. So shall we begin ?

I look forward to your active participation tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT time. I am eager for our interaction. As we embark on a new day, let's reflect on the wisdom from Proverbs 3:5-6 (NIV): *'Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.'*
31/1/24, 10:13 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Good morning Everyone!*

1/2/24, 8:45 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning!
I trust you are doing well. I've observed that my messages have been read but not responded to. In moments of silence, I'm reminded of Psalm 37:7 (NIV): "Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him." Is everything alright?
1/2/24, 10:27 AM - +263 77 377 6257: Good Morning. Sorry for the late response.
1/2/24, 10:32 AM - +263 77 377 6257: As Dyllan's mother, I would like to gather the courage and admit that I have failed to gather the required fees for the scholarship. I failed do to economic hardships. I am grateful for the opportunity that was granted to my Son earlier. 
He made me proud by doing well in his A levels, unfortunately he can no further his education in India or local university.

Please don't worry; I am also a parent, and I understand the economic challenges that can make things difficult. However, as parents, we can collectively strive to provide the best opportunities for our children to pursue their aspirations and achieve their dreams in life.
1/2/24, 10:42 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Can you please share what is the monthly budget that you can afford for your child's tertiary education ?

1/2/24, 4:36 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats, however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge.  Having Conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

I'm sure you and your family have discussed this thoroughly. What decisions have you made for your future? Considering the cost and employment opportunities, have you compared the benefits of studying in India with the Edoofa program against other options?
