24/1/24, 10:43 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *_🌟 URGENT UPDATE 🌟_*
Natasha, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

In light of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. *As of now, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable* and I am confident that together, we will create something truly extraordinary.

*Great news – there's a reserved spot just for you in the registration process!* 
We understand that sometimes deadlines can be challenging to meet. Missing the registration fee deadline might seem like a roadblock, however, it isn't yet! Your dedication matters the most to us.

I am sure that your admissions officers must have already taken the first steps, and as a mentor, it is my advice to you to have transparency in your conversations so that we can help you fulfill your goal of arriving in India for your higher education! ✅
There’s a catch! You now have a chance to fast-track your admissions process and meet your officers too! 😀

I strongly recommend bringing your parents and guardians—they play a crucial role as decision-makers in your educational journey. This event provides a glimpse into your future and an opportunity for them to actively participate in your potential journey, gaining a deeper understanding of the program.
Get ready for this adventure, and I'm thrilled that you'll be part of this phenomenal event! ✨
