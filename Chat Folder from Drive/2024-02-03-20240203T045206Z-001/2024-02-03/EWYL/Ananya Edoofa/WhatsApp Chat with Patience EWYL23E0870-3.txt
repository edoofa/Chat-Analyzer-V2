I hope you all had the merriest Christmas celebration! 🎄 Due to the festive break, our session on Monday had to be called off. No worries, though – I hope you enjoyed the extra time for the festivities.

I'm looking forward to catching up with all of you!

It has been observed that you have not been attending your sessions lately, nor following your EWYL ritual.

You know, we specifically allocate slots and time for you, and your non-attendance is truly disappointing and demotivating.

If you are facing any challenges, please let me know so that I can assist you. If you do not share it with me, how would I be able to help you?
15/1/24, 9:36 AM - +263 77 339 1635: Sorry for that. Patience's phone was stolen so for now she does not have a phone. She will get in touch with you as soon as she gets another phone
15/1/24, 12:10 PM - +263 77 133 7570: I apologize on behalf of Patience for not communicating. We have overwhelmed by the ugly incident that involved her phone being stolen, all her books and other school material stolen. She is trying to be back online, please bear with her.
15/1/24, 1:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, @263771337570 @263773391635 

I understand, and I hope you are doing well. If you don't mind, may I ask what happened? Is everything alright? <This message was edited>
15/1/24, 1:26 PM - +263 77 339 1635: Thieves broke into the house and stole books bags and the phone. Otherwise everything is ok
15/1/24, 4:25 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Oh my God! I hope they have not harmed anyone!
24/1/24, 10:44 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *_🌟 URGENT UPDATE 🌟_*

Patience, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

In light of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. *As of now, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable* and I am confident that together, we will create something truly extraordinary.
