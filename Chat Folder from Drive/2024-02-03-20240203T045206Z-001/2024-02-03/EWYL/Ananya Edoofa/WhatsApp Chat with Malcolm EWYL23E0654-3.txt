7/1/24, 8:43 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called SLICE CON' 24 for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
7/1/24, 8:43 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the 8th, 9th, and 10th of January, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
7/1/24, 8:46 PM - +27 68 790 9284: Wow this seems really great
7/1/24, 8:46 PM - +27 68 790 9284: Alright
16/1/24, 9:35 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, malcolm!

I hope you are doing well. I have noticed that you are not following your EWYL ritual on time. It is crucial for you to follow the ritual as it ensures that you do not miss out on any information and important posts. Kindly do it right now, and let us proceed with our session!
16/1/24, 10:46 AM - +27 68 790 9284: Alright apologize
19/1/24, 9:49 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Malcolm!

I hope you are doing well. I am waiting for you on your EWYL line to move ahead with your session. Kindly join the line quickly!
19/1/24, 10:26 AM - +27 68 790 9284: Alright please
19/1/24, 10:34 AM - +27 68 790 9284: Apologies for being late again ,by any chance is it possible to adjust the timetable a little bit ,early in the morning lm usually overwhelmed with chores
19/1/24, 3:12 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Malcolm, it would be tough for me to schedule a call earlier than 9:30 am.
19/1/24, 3:13 PM - +27 68 790 9284: Ooh🤔alright l understand l will try to keep up with the time
22/1/24, 4:27 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *_🌟 URGENT UPDATE 🌟_*

Malcolm, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it's going to be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes proper time and effort, our team will be occupied so tight. Therefore, I was thinking of connecting only once a week for the time being.

Therefore, your new session timing will be *Every Tuesday, 9:30 a.m*. ⏰

Can't wait for this adventure together, see you tomorrow! 🚀
26/1/24, 6:41 PM - +27 68 790 9284: L am a proud EDOOFIAN
1/2/24, 4:07 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon,Malcolm!

*_Are you tired of connecting with us only through screens?_*
 
Well, now is the time! Guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – just like last year, this month, we're planning an annual and exclusive meet & greet in Africa! 🌍🎉 

However, this time it’s different! It’s a mega event that has never happened in the history of Zimbabwe, as we are expecting a crowd of 5000 people! Surprising, isn't it?

Now, we understand that you and your parents must have a lot of questions in your mind as you are in the middle of your University admission process. Therefore, keeping this in mind, along with Mr. Angad, our admissions team, and our counselors will be there as well to address all of your concerns!
1/2/24, 4:07 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, bring your parents along, and don't miss your chance to expedite your admission process. Not only that, get ready to dive into the opportunities you are going to experience when you are here in India, as Mr. Angad himself is going to walk you through the journey of being an Edoofian. After all, only 6 months are left! So, get ready for this epic adventure, and I'll share the details with you super soon! ⚡

*By the way, we'd like to reserve your seats in advance. Could you please let us know how many people you'll be coming with? This will help us allocate the right number of slots for you.*
1/2/24, 6:27 PM - +27 68 790 9284: Oooh
2/2/24, 3:40 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Malcolm!

Alright, I am sure you are excited, so get ready to experience something big and exciting! 🚀
