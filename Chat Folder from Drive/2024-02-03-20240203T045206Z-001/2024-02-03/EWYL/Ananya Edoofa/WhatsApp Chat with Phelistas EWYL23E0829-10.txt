6/1/24, 1:28 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Phelistas!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:28 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
15/1/24, 8:45 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, @263772407949 

I have been waiting to hear from you for more than a few weeks now, and I am very disappointed to see that you are not showing sincerity towards our EWYL program. You know we specifically allocate slots and time for you, and your non-attendance is truly disappointing and demotivating.

I hope you remember that you have signed a document to ensure your availability for completing the orientation. Although the scheduled time for your orientation has already passed, I have taken it upon myself to extend and complete your orientation. However, it seems like you do not value this opportunity. Can I know the reason behind this? Do you wish to discuss something with me?

Now that your results are here, I hope you realize that you are one step closer to *your dream of studying in INDIA!* I understand there might be some challenges preventing you from attending your sessions regularly. However, why not step up and focus on financing your education while learning some valuable skills?

I've taken some time to discuss this with you. Remember, when you signed up for the EWYL program, you had aspirations for your life, including plans for earning and financing your education. I am confident that you still want to pursue those goals, right? I believe we can make your parents' investment worth it. What do you think? Isn't it the right time?⌛
