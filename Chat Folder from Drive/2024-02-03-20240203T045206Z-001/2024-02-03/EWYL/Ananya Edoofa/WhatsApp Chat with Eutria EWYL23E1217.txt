30/1/24, 2:07 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, before we move forward I would like to know more about you!
Would you like to share a quick introduction?
30/1/24, 2:14 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Okay Ma'am. My name is Eutria Mapfumo a female born in 2003 on the 12th of July and I am the first born in a family of four. I have completed my Advanced level in 2022 at Mwenezi government Hig School which is In Zimbabwe Masvingo Province and I was enrolled in a science where I was studying Mathematics, Biology and Chemistry. I am interested in science and to know more about new scientific facts through researching. I have been struggling a lot in my education from primary until in secondary but I really appreciate my father who has been working hard to sponsor for my education.
30/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great to meet you! 🌸 Wow, being the firstborn in a family of four must come with its own adventures. 🌈 Completing your Advanced level in the science stream is a big achievement! 👏 Math, Biology, and Chemistry—serious brainpower! 🧠 Your interest in science and researching new facts is fantastic. Keep that curiosity alive! 🚀 It's inspiring to hear about your journey, and major kudos to your dad for supporting your education.
30/1/24, 2:22 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Thank you ma'am, I am also happy to be part of this program, with your assistance I only hope for the best.
30/1/24, 2:35 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
30/1/24, 2:40 PM - +263 78 837 6846: What I know is that the EWYL program helps in making the education for students to be more affordable by earning credits which will be added to their tuition fees.
30/1/24, 3:10 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let us connect in our next session which is tomorrow at the same time.
30/1/24, 3:27 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Okay ma'am.
31/1/24, 1:31 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Good afternoon ma'am
31/1/24, 1:35 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Eutria!

How are you doing?  Is it stable now? Are you ready to begin our session?🚀
31/1/24, 1:38 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Yes ma'am we can start the session
31/1/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
31/1/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
31/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Okay that is great
31/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Okay I understand
31/1/24, 2:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
31/1/24, 2:03 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Okay ma'am
31/1/24, 2:04 PM - Ananya Edoofa: MENTOR - I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
31/1/24, 2:05 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Yes it's quite interesting
31/1/24, 2:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
