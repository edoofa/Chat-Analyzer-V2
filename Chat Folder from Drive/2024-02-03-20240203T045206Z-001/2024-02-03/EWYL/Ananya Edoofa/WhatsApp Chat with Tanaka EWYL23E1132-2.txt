18/1/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Wonderful, my student! So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
18/1/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 78 441 3438: Wow It's so inspiring
18/1/24, 2:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?
18/1/24, 2:08 PM - +263 78 441 3438: Ok
18/1/24, 2:15 PM - +263 78 441 3438: I'm Tanaka Sharmaine Sabawu. I'm a girl aged 19. I wrote my A level exams last year November and my wish is to become a lawyer. My favorite hobby is valley ball.
18/1/24, 2:35 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Nice to meet you! 😊 It's awesome that you're aiming to become a lawyer. Best of luck with your A-level exams from last November! 📚 Volleyball is such a fun hobby. Do you play for a team or just casually with friends?
18/1/24, 2:38 PM - +263 78 441 3438: I used to play in a school team
18/1/24, 2:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Oh, that's amazing!
18/1/24, 2:40 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Tanaka, I wish we could have connected for a longer time today. However, since our session is for one hour only, we can now connect tomorrow at the same time.
18/1/24, 2:41 PM - +263 78 441 3438: Ok that's fine
19/1/24, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tanaka!
Before beginning today's session, I want you to check out this incredible post :

https://www.instagram.com/p/CzVl_ADBbbz/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
19/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 78 441 3438: Afternoon how are you
19/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 78 441 3438: Ok
19/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 78 441 3438: I'm trying to open it
19/1/24, 1:42 PM - Ananya Edoofa: That's alright. You can watch it later.
19/1/24, 1:42 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
19/1/24, 1:46 PM - +263 78 441 3438: Noo can you kindly explain them to me
19/1/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
19/1/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
19/1/24, 1:52 PM - +263 78 441 3438: Ok
19/1/24, 1:53 PM - +263 78 441 3438: Wow that's incredible
19/1/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
19/1/24, 1:58 PM - +263 78 441 3438: Ok it's nice to have them
19/1/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
19/1/24, 2:06 PM - +263 78 441 3438: Yes so interesting
19/1/24, 2:09 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
19/1/24, 2:09 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 2:11 PM - +263 78 441 3438: Ok
19/1/24, 2:22 PM - +263 78 441 3438: I'm done
19/1/24, 2:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
19/1/24, 2:25 PM - +263 78 441 3438: It's hard to tell honestly mostly the last two sections
19/1/24, 2:25 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great!  At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
19/1/24, 2:27 PM - +263 78 441 3438: Sounds great
19/1/24, 2:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
19/1/24, 2:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 2:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, share your understanding of this document with me before our next session. 

Let's connect on Monday since we don't have sessions over the weekend. Happy Weekend! 🚀 <This message was edited>
19/1/24, 2:32 PM - +263 78 441 3438: Ok I'll share my understanding before the next session
19/1/24, 4:53 PM - +263 71 925 7047 joined using this group's invite link
22/1/24, 1:02 PM - +263 78 441 3438: Good afternoon
22/1/24, 1:04 PM - +263 78 441 3438: My understanding about that document is it shows the process that one will go through the EWYL process and also the amounts that are being earned through this program
22/1/24, 1:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tanaka!

Let us begin our session with an interesting fact!

*_Did you know that a group of flamingos is called a 'flamboyance.' So, just like the flamboyance of flamingos, let's add a touch of flair to our session today._*

Ready to soar into the world of curiosity?🦩
22/1/24, 1:35 PM - +263 78 441 3438: Afternoon how are you
22/1/24, 1:36 PM - +263 78 441 3438: Yes I'm ready
22/1/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
22/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 2:01 PM - +263 78 441 3438: Still downloading
22/1/24, 2:02 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Is it done, Tanaka?
22/1/24, 2:05 PM - +263 78 441 3438: I'm still listening
22/1/24, 2:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
22/1/24, 2:12 PM - +263 78 441 3438: The EWYL program is meant to understand the market one would work for in the future and have more knowledge on it
One has to connect with different companies and managers in my country and be decisive about them.
22/1/24, 2:12 PM - +263 78 441 3438: I have to them about my program at Edoofa
22/1/24, 2:12 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good work, Tanaka!
22/1/24, 2:13 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
22/1/24, 2:13 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 2:13 PM - +263 78 441 3438: Ok
22/1/24, 2:14 PM - Ananya Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
22/1/24, 2:24 PM - +263 78 441 3438: My understanding about the document is that it needs one to look for companies that helps in extending overall development to all the students that enroll for the Edoofa program and these companies must have the potential to collaborate with Edoofa.
When searching for the companies one has to look for the nature of the company, scale of the company, financial stability and the background of the founder
22/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Before we wrap up today's session, I want to leave you with a burst of motivation. Remember, each effort you put into our project is like planting a seed. Nurture it with dedication, watch it grow with collaboration, and soon you'll reap the rewards in the form of credits. Let's bring our collective brilliance to this project and make it shine. 

Together, there's no limit to what we can achieve. Let's go out there, give it our all, and earn those well-deserved credits! Until our next meeting, stay inspired and keep rocking!
22/1/24, 2:27 PM - +263 78 441 3438: Thank you so much for the inspiring words
23/1/24, 1:35 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tanaka!

23/1/24, 2:03 PM - +263 78 441 3438: Yes i did read about that
23/1/24, 2:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 2:09 PM - +263 78 441 3438: So we are putting the first project on hold and focus on the second project is it what you are saying

23/1/24, 2:14 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *Now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it!
23/1/24, 2:14 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 2:15 PM - +263 78 441 3438: Ok

23/1/24, 2:23 PM - +263 78 441 3438: Ok
My understanding about the 2nd project is that it is a community building program were by I've to tell my friends who have just finished their high school or who just wrote their exams about the Edoofa program and those who are willing can sign the forms and I've to reach about 10 people
23/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ananya Edoofa: That’s awesome, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.

24/1/24, 1:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *_“The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step._”* - Lao Tzu

As we embark on today's session, let's remember that every small effort contributes to significant progress. Let's take that first step together and make the most out of our time. Ready to dive in?
24/1/24, 1:42 PM - +263 78 441 3438: Yes I'm ready
24/1/24, 1:49 PM - Ananya Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
24/1/24, 1:51 PM - +263 78 441 3438: That's exciting
24/1/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
24/1/24, 1:56 PM - +263 78 441 3438: Ok
24/1/24, 1:59 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
24/1/24, 1:59 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
24/1/24, 1:59 PM - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
24/1/24, 1:59 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
24/1/24, 1:59 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
24/1/24, 1:59 PM - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

24/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 78 441 3438: Ok
24/1/24, 2:03 PM - +263 78 441 3438: How am i supposed to be added to the group
24/1/24, 2:09 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, in order to move ahead with your second project, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
24/1/24, 2:09 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*

Best of Luck!

Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready.

24/1/24, 2:26 PM - +263 78 441 3438: So i have to share these with those students
24/1/24, 2:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, Tanaka!
24/1/24, 2:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, it’s been an interesting conversation with you so far. However, I have some cool things left to share and thus, I think we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
24/1/24, 2:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 2:33 PM - +263 78 441 3438: Ok
24/1/24, 2:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Before we wrap up, here's a quick joke to add a smile to your day:

Why don't scientists trust atoms?

Because they make up everything!

Thank you all for a great session. Remember, laughter is the best medicine. Until next time!🚀
24/1/24, 2:34 PM - +263 78 441 3438: Have a nice day
25/1/24, 1:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tanaka!

Let us begin our session with a fun fact: 

The tongue of a blue whale, the largest animal on Earth, can weigh as much as an elephant. Despite their massive size, blue whales primarily feed on tiny shrimp-like animals called krill, using their enormous tongues to filter them from the water.🐋
25/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 78 441 3438: Afternoon how are you
25/1/24, 1:45 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, did you get a chance to listen to the audio?

25/1/24, 2:02 PM - +263 78 441 3438: My understanding about the third program is that it is meant to make their teachers proud of them by  getting an opportunity to qualify for being an Edoofa student.
One has to reach to the local school mostly to the principals and also the school that one used to learn at and inform them about the Edoofa program.
One can make a list of schools in the local area and start visiting one's former school and tell them why you joined the Edoofa and what are your plans for your future
25/1/24, 2:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have- so, congratulations . However, I’d still like to ask- are there any questions you have about this project?
25/1/24, 2:10 PM - +263 78 441 3438: I need to ask what am i supposed to do if my former school is not near my local are

Every day you have to come and say "I am a proud EDOOFIAN' on the EWYL line.
It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, "I am a proud Edoofian.
31/1/24, 2:17 PM - +263 78 441 3438: Am i to send this message to you even now
31/1/24, 2:18 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Yes! As we plan for our sessions, you have the flexibility to choose between the following options:

Option 1: Monday and Thursday
Option 2: Tuesday and Friday
Feel free to select the days that best suit your schedule. Following your decision, I will provide you with an updated timetable.

Additionally, every Wednesday, I will share a piece of Wednesday wisdom, and we can discuss it in our subsequent session. Similarly, every Saturday, you will receive your weekend activity, and we will review it in our next session. Both of these components are essential for your evaluation and progress, so ensure their completion.

It's crucial to note that you will only receive your lessons and activities if you follow your EWYL (Every Week, Your Life) ritual consistently. Make it a daily practice, especially in the morning, to ensure timely sharing of activities and lessons.
31/1/24, 2:20 PM - +263 78 441 3438: I go for option 1
