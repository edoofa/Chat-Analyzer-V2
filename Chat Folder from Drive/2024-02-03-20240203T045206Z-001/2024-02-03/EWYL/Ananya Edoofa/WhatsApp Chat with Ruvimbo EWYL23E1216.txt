2/2/24, 1:48 PM - +263 78 062 8834: As you already know I'm Ruvimbo Ashley Zimunya and I'm the first child in a family of three.I'm a sport person but I love volleyball more compared to other sporting activities.I'm also good at art and reading novels is part of my hobbie
2/2/24, 1:49 PM - +263 78 062 8834: I did my 'O' level at Hartzell High and my 'A' level at Marange High
2/2/24, 1:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Hello Ruvimbo Ashley Zimunya! It's wonderful to learn more about you. Being the first child in a family of three must come with its own set of responsibilities and joys. It's great that you have a passion for sports, particularly volleyball, and that you excel in art as well. Your interests in reading novels sound like a fantastic way to unwind and explore different worlds.
2/2/24, 2:00 PM - +263 78 062 8834: Yes I agree with you,being the first child comes with a set of responsibilities and a lot is expected from you.
2/2/24, 2:05 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Indeed!  Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
2/2/24, 2:11 PM - +263 78 062 8834: Yes a little but it will help if you explain further
2/2/24, 2:19 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
2/2/24, 2:19 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
2/2/24, 2:25 PM - +263 78 062 8834: Well understood!
2/2/24, 2:31 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
2/2/24, 2:33 PM - +263 78 062 8834: I'm glad to know that the Head of the Department and the Head coach will be assisting throughout the program
2/2/24, 2:44 PM - +263 78 062 8834: Greetings Ms Sanjana and Ms Davi
2/2/24, 2:49 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Ruvimbo, it was nice connecting with you today. I wish we could talk a bit more; however, since our session time is over, let's connect on Monday as we don't have sessions over the weekend!

Happy weekend!🚀
