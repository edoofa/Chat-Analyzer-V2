2/2/24, 2:05 PM - +263 71 416 7312: My name is Chipo Natalie Mugoniwa. Am from Zimbabwe. I wrote my form six last year and I obtained 7points while doing Pure Mathematics,Bussiness studies and Accounting . Well I have always been passionate about being a Chartered accountant. With my results I wasn't really satisfied about them but on the bright side it is a sign and opportunity of mine to keep on working hard in order to pursue my dreams to the maximum level with this scholarship. I am a hardworking girl aged 19 , through past events I can say I have leadership skills and teamwork skills as well . Am also good with computers as I have a nationally recognized certicate in my computer operations and packages in which I have a distinction. Amongst my goals I want to be successful, create a name for myself in society , I want to create my own firm and teach society about being Chartered accountants and mostly my parents I want to make them really proud by excelling in my academics and my country as well. 

In terms of hobbies I play netball and chess as well . Back in school I also participated in Quiz competitions as well. In conclusion it will be outmost honour for me to become a Chartered accountant with the help of the Eddofa program and the team as well
2/2/24, 2:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Hi Chipo Natalie Mugoniwa! Congratulations on your Form Six results and your ambition to become a Chartered Accountant. Your dedication is admirable, and your leadership and computer skills are valuable assets. Keep working hard towards your goals, and if you have any questions or need advice, feel free to ask. Best of luck on your journey!
2/2/24, 2:11 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Thank you so very much ma'am
2/2/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Wonderful, my student! So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
2/2/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/2/24, 2:21 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Okay ma'am let me watch it
2/2/24, 2:24 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Wow thank you ma'am . Am also eager to walk this journey with you as my mentor and receive as much guidance I need in my journey to success
2/2/24, 2:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
2/2/24, 2:31 PM - +263 71 416 7312: No I don't ma'am
2/2/24, 2:43 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
2/2/24, 2:44 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
2/2/24, 2:48 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Understood ma'am
2/2/24, 2:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Natalie, it was nice connecting with you today. I wish we could talk a bit more; however, since our session time is over, let's connect on Monday as we don't have sessions over the weekend!

Happy weekend!🚀
2/2/24, 2:49 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Thank you ma'am . Same applies
