I trust this message finds you well. I am Ms. Ananya, your mentor for the EWYL program. Together, we will work hard and aim for the sky to earn maximum scholarship credits from this program.

I apologize for the slight delay from my end. The reason being, I am thrilled to share with you that our team is planning an Africa Trip next month. Just like last year, we have a lot to plan, and therefore, I have been occupied with the preparations.

Thank you for your understanding, and I am eager to start our journey in the EWYL program with you.
29/1/24, 3:49 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We will be having our first session on 30th January and for that, I'd like to offer you a choice between two-time slots. Please select one that works for you:

Monday to Friday, 8:30 AM to 9:30 AM
Monday to Friday, 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM

30/1/24, 12:26 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, @263773407203 

I hope you are doing well, so can I know if you will be available to complete Tendai's orientation with me?

30/1/24, 2:10 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
30/1/24, 2:10 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 2:16 PM - +263 77 340 7203: Thank you so much for the detailed introduction.
30/1/24, 2:16 PM - +263 77 340 7203: It is an interesting one.

30/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Thank you for your kind words. Now, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?

30/1/24, 2:28 PM - +263 77 340 7203: Not quite clear, please do share.
30/1/24, 2:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
30/1/24, 2:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
30/1/24, 2:43 PM - +263 77 340 7203: oooh owkay, it is clear
30/1/24, 2:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let us connect in our next session which is tomorrow at the same time.
30/1/24, 2:53 PM - +263 77 340 7203: thats fine, thank you for your team
30/1/24, 2:53 PM - +263 77 340 7203: enjoy the rest of your day
31/1/24, 1:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tendai!

How are you doing? Are you ready to begin our session?🚀
31/1/24, 1:40 PM - +263 77 340 7203: Good afternoon
31/1/24, 1:43 PM - +263 77 340 7203: Tendai is not available, imthe one available, we can start
31/1/24, 1:56 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts. <This message was edited>
31/1/24, 1:58 PM - +263 77 340 7203: thank you
31/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 77 340 7203: It is my pleasure to be introduced to you Ms. Davi and Ms. Sanjana
31/1/24, 2:08 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
31/1/24, 2:14 PM - +263 77 340 7203: I would like to confirm if i am i expected to be participating in these exercises.
31/1/24, 2:18 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, Tendai!
31/1/24, 2:18 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
