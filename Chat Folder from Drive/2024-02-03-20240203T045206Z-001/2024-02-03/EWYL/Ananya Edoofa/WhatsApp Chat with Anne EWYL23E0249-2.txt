26/12/23, 9:28 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Anne!

I really hope that your Christmas went well. Let's discuss how we celebrated our Christmas this year in our session! Come on, join your EWYL Line, and let's talk about our celebration!
26/12/23, 4:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Anne!

I hope you all had the merriest Christmas celebration! 🎄 Due to the festive break, our session on Monday had to be called off. No worries, though – I hope you enjoyed the extra time for the festivities.

To make up for it, let's have a compensatory session *tomorrow at 9:30 am*.
I'm looking forward to catching up with all of you! <This message was edited>
27/12/23, 5:00 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Anne!

Well, what I have observed today is that if I have not shared a reminder with you before the session, you have clearly missed your session! Don't you think it's a bit irresponsible behavior? Do you get a reminder before your classes at school?
29/12/23, 3:15 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *_New Year is here!🌟_*

As we are going to embark on a new chapter at the dawn of the New Year, I wanted to take a moment to send my warmest wishes your way. May this coming year be filled with joy, laughter, and moments of profound happiness. 🌈

Along with you, the Edoofa Family will also be occupied in *New Year Celebrations from tomorrow till 1 January 2024* and we will *resume from 2 January onwards*🎉

Wishing you a year ahead filled with love, prosperity, and the fulfillment of your heart's desires. May every day be a chance for you to shine and make a positive impact. ✨

Happy New Year in advance! 🎊

I hope you had a fantastic New Year! Because of the holiday break, our Monday session had to be canceled, but don't worry about it. I hope you enjoyed the extra time for celebrations.🌟

To make up for it, let's have a special session *tomorrow at 9:30 AM*. Get ready to tell me how you celebrated the New Year, and I'll also share my resolution with you. I'm looking forward to catching up with you!🕤
7/1/24, 8:45 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called SLICE CON' 24 for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
7/1/24, 8:45 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the 8th, 9th, and 10th of January, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
7/1/24, 8:48 PM - +263 71 726 0199: I'm good and you

Wow thats really great💫.. can't wait to see those amazing moments
15/1/24, 9:41 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Anne!

I hope you are doing well. I have noticed that you are not following your EWYL ritual on time. It is crucial for you to follow the ritual as it ensures that you do not miss out on any information and important posts. Kindly do it right now, and let us proceed with our session!
22/1/24, 9:45 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Anne!

I hope you are doing well. It's a new week, and I'm eager to connect with you on your EWYL line. Please join your EWYL line to proceed with our session!
24/1/24, 10:38 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *_🌟 URGENT UPDATE 🌟_*

Anne, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

In light of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. *As of now, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable* and I am confident that together, we will create something truly extraordinary.
24/1/24, 11:10 AM - +263 71 726 0199: Wow thats great 🌟.Noted

Remember the event I teased you about in Africa? Well, it's happening next month, and it's going to be massive – the biggest in Zimbabwe's history, with an expected crowd of *5000 people*! Surprising, isn't it? Get ready for an unforgettable experience! 🌍🎉

This time it is bigger and better! Our Founder & CEO, Mr. Angad along with our team, admission officers, and counselors whom all of you have met behind the screens— are up to share priceless insights that will shape your next four years in India.
1/2/24, 2:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *We'd like to reserve your seats in advance. Could you please let us know how many people you'll be coming with? This will help us allocate the right number of slots for you.*

I recommend bringing your parents and guardians to the event. They play a crucial role in your education decisions. This event offers them a chance to understand the program and witness the journeys of past students, providing valuable insights for your higher education journey in India. So, get ready for this epic adventure, and I'll share the details with you super soon!
