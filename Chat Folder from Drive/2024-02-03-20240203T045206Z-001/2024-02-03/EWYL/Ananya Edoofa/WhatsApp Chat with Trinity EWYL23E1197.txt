1/2/24, 1:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Trinity!

How are you doing? Let us begin our session with a small joke; Why don't skeletons fight each other?

They don't have the guts!😅
1/2/24, 1:51 PM - +263 77 623 5022: Kkkk very funny kkk, afternoon  how are you
1/2/24, 1:56 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I am good, Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
1/2/24, 2:03 PM - +263 77 623 5022: No , l think they are goals
1/2/24, 2:09 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
1/2/24, 2:09 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
1/2/24, 2:12 PM - +263 77 623 5022: Ok
1/2/24, 2:14 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
1/2/24, 2:20 PM - +263 77 623 5022: Thank you for letting me know them
1/2/24, 2:26 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I know that we could not have a fruitful session today because I was occupied with planning and preparing for our Africa trip. However, tomorrow we will have a fruitful session as usual, so be there on time!🚀
1/2/24, 2:28 PM - Ananya Edoofa: This message was deleted
1/2/24, 2:28 PM - +263 77 623 5022: Ok, thank you very much
2/2/24, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Trinity!

I hope you are doing well. Are you ready to begin today's session?
2/2/24, 1:45 PM - +263 77 623 5022: Afternoon
2/2/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Today, I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
2/2/24, 1:55 PM - +263 77 623 5022: Im ready
2/2/24, 1:56 PM - +263 77 623 5022: Yes
2/2/24, 2:00 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
2/2/24, 2:00 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/2/24, 2:20 PM - +263 77 623 5022: Thank you for the document, it was very interesting
2/2/24, 2:24 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
2/2/24, 2:41 PM - +263 77 623 5022: EWYL mentors.
2/2/24, 2:49 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Trinity, it was nice connecting with you today. I wish we could talk a bit more; however, since our session time is over, let's connect on Monday as we don't have sessions over the weekend!

Happy weekend!🚀
2/2/24, 2:52 PM - +263 77 623 5022: Ok, you too have a blessed weekend
