Okay ma’am. Looking forward to it
16/1/24, 9:51 AM - +91 90416 75658: And I hope its quick because we are opening in 3 days time
18/1/24, 4:48 PM - +91 90416 75658: Greetings ma’am I hope you are well


I just wanted to check if there is progress from your side concerning the redemption of credits. Sorry for bothering but its because I am concerned. We are officially opening schools starting Monday and as I am hearing from the others the timetable has already been uploaded. And without completion of the remaining fee I can not access it, so my request was if by any means you could speed up this process that would be greatly alpreciated. I also need to access the timetable so I can know what is to come in the coming term. 

Thank you
18/1/24, 5:00 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Kelvin!

I hope you are doing fine. Our team is just analyzing the calculations and credits. It would take around two days. <This message was edited>
