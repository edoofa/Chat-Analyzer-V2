27/12/23, 3:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Arthur,

I hope this message finds you well amidst your ongoing exams. I couldn't help but notice that I haven't received a Christmas greeting from you. I understand that exam preparations are consuming much of your time and energy, but it's disheartening to see that you couldn't spare a couple of minutes to extend your wishes.

As your mentor, I've been supportive and have even provided you with holidays to dedicate to your exam preparations. However, it's disconcerting to witness a lack of acknowledgment or a brief moment taken to convey your holiday wishes.

Is there something on your mind, or is there a reason for this silence?
27/12/23, 3:52 PM - +91 95015 56890: pardon me ma’am, I sincerely apologize for not being able to return your message in time. Thank you for wishing me a merry festive season, I really appreciated the message. Christmas was nice on our end and I too trust you have been in good and healthy spirits over the last couple of days.😊
27/12/23, 8:17 PM - +263 77 287 4241: Dear Mentor,

As Arthur's parents, we wish to thank you a million times for the unwavering mentoring support you have been providing to our son since day 1. You have been consistent, patient and professional through & through. As his parents, we rest assured that Arthur is taken very good care of. Maintain the tempo & keep the momentum ma'am Ana. 
Now I am failing to understand how & why Arthur could fail to spare you a thought by dropping you a Christmas greeting - at least! I doubt if that noble gesture would have cost Arthur even a half rupee.

Anyways, as Arthur's parents, we wish you ma'am Ana and the rest of EDOOFA team a prosperous NEW YEAR. Continue being good & supportive to son Arthur.
Be blessed abundantly!

Our kindest of regards,

Arthur's mom & dad
28/12/23, 7:59 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, @263772874241 

Thank you so much for your kind gesture and sweet words. I am truly happy and grateful to have your support. Regarding Arthur, he is a very sweet boy, and I believe he must be occupied; hence, he couldn't respond. Otherwise, he never misses a chance to make me proud.
31/12/23, 6:19 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *_Cheers to a Sparkling New Year!❄️_*

As we end the year, your dedication is impressive! With exams done and the New Year approaching, embrace that fresh energy and positivity. Your well-planned thinking will shine as you find new ways to fund your education. Stay focused, stay determined, and get ready to achieve your goals.🌟

Wishing you a year ahead filled with joy and success. Also, as a New Year gift, we have an amazing *Industrial Visit* planned, so get ready for that as well! 

*Happy New Year in advance!* 🎉
1/1/24, 7:30 AM - +91 95015 56890: thank you very much ma’am😊

3/1/24, 8:24 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *_Arthur, It's time to reunite and dive into some post-break Whatsapp session! 🌟_*

3/1/24, 2:54 PM - +91 95015 56890: well on the New Year’s Eve, I was at church for a crossover. It was truly a blessing and in a way I felt like it gave me a jumpstart on 2024🤩 I have many resolutions that I intend to meet, most of which are more on a personal level. One of my resolutions for this year is to do well in school, and be a disciplined individual.

In today's Wednesday lesson, we'll delve into the impactful realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and computer technology in the context of saving lives. We'll explore how innovative solutions are leveraging these technologies to make a significant difference in healthcare.

Furthermore, we'll discuss a noteworthy case study involving a startup from Zambia that has effectively translated the concept of using AI and computer technology into practical applications for improving healthcare outcomes. I encourage you to read the provided PDF carefully, as it promises to open your mind to multiple opportunities within this dynamic field.

This lesson aims not only to broaden your understanding of the transformative potential of technology in healthcare but also to inspire you to explore ways you can contribute within your capacities. Feel free to come prepared with questions and ideas for a lively and engaging discussion.
