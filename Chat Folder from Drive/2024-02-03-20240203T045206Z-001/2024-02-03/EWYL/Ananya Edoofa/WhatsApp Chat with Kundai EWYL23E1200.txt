31/1/24, 4:33 PM - +263 71 256 8023: I'm sorry but l go to school from Monday to Friday and school ends at 1530 so l will  reach home at 1630 .l am sorry if l am causing any difficulties but we are not allowed to bring cellphones at school .
31/1/24, 4:34 PM - +263 71 256 8023: So is ok if we can start maybe 1630 to 1730 .once again l am sorry if l am causing problems or offending you
1/2/24, 2:13 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Kundai, I understand about your school timings however it is crucial for you to finish your EWYL orientation with me, as mentioned earlier. If you are not able to do that, you can ask your parents to attend the session with me and understand the basics of the program.

This will ensure a smooth process, and we can later connect on the projects only. Please let me know if you proceed in this manner.
1/2/24, 4:29 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Yes , we can proceed .My parents can be in touch with you
2/2/24, 1:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Kundai!

That's great! So, shall we begin ?
2/2/24, 2:56 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I was hoping for a response, however, since our session time is over, let's connect on Monday as we don't have sessions over the weekend!

Happy weekend!🚀
2/2/24, 4:29 PM - +263 71 256 8023: I'm sorry for the late response, l was at school . Have a great weekend
