Natasha, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

In light of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. *Today, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable* and I am confident that together, we will create something truly extraordinary.

24/1/24, 6:56 PM - +263 77 932 6462: Hello sir hope l find you well.It is with a heavy heart that becoz of circumstances beyond our own control we have no option but to withdraw Natasha from the scholarship program.we have taken long to make this decision becoz we had hoped our situation would change for the better and allow our daughter to continue with her studies abroad.Due to economic situation prevailing in our country my financial abilities were affected when l lost my job around October last year.As a family we have decided that our remaining source of income may not be able to sustain our child while abroab.We have sat down with Natasha who l should say understood the family predicament.We are therefore officially pulling out of the scholarship program as we are unable to continue with it now and in the future.we want to thank the Edoofa team for the wonderful support we got from you from the. onset.Special thanks to Natasha's mentor Ms Ananyafor being so patient and encouraging even when she could clearly see all was not well with Natasha.Again thank you to everyone.May God bless you all.
