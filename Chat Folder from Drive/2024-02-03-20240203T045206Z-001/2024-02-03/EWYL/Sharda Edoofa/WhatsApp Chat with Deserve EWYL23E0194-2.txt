29/12/23, 2:14 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Exciting news! With the new year approaching (and guess what, it's our session day!), But don't worry, I have got it all covered. *I have rescheduled that session to Wednesday (3rd jan'2024) at 9:30 am* 🌟 

With the New Year around the corner, we're just a few months away from having you join us here in India. 🇮🇳
 Hence, let's make these sessions our top priority. They're like golden tickets to more scholarship credits and supercharged college prep! 🚀 Your dedication is the secret sauce to our success! 🎓✨
6/1/24, 1:38 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Good day Deserve
I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:41 PM - Sharda Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
15/1/24, 10:45 AM - Sharda Edoofa: kindly excuse the basic confusion - *the session is scheduled with you at the usual time which is from 12:00PM.* Please be available at the scheduled time.
15/1/24, 10:47 AM - +263 71 400 8155: Noted
22/1/24, 12:04 PM - Sharda Edoofa: *Good afternoon*
I would like to remind you that you have a session *scheduled today on the EWYL Line at 1:30pm*, kindly come to the line and follow your EWYL Line ritual of saying *'I am a proud Edoofian'*

*I am waiting on the EWYL Line.*
22/1/24, 12:16 PM - Sharda Edoofa: *Kindly note the updated time - It is 12:00PM.* Hence, the session have already started. Kindly come to the line right now.
27/1/24, 8:57 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *Greetings of the day, Deserve*
I hope this message finds you in good spirits. I want to share some heartfelt news with you. After careful consideration, I've come to a decision that carries a mix of emotions. *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor.*

As we journey through this moment, I can't help but feel a mix of emotions realizing that our daily interactions are about to change. *Saying goodbye to our current way of connecting brings a bittersweet feeling*, but deep down, I see change as a chance for growth and the discovery of new opportunities.

Reflecting on our shared journey, I am truly humbled by the extraordinary moments we've experienced together—the bonds we've forged, the shared laughter, and the countless instances of mutual growth and learning.
27/1/24, 8:59 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

Thank you for being an integral part of my life's journey. Keep radiating brilliance, dare to dream ambitiously, and always remember the remarkable potential within you. 
*I want to assure you that the mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
1/2/24, 3:37 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon, Deserve!

Remember the event I teased you about in Africa? Well, it's happening next month, and it's going to be massive – the biggest in Zimbabwe's history, with an expected crowd of *5000 people*! Surprising, isn't it? Get ready for an unforgettable experience! 🌍🎉

This time it is bigger and better! Our Founder & CEO, Mr. Angad along with our team, admission officers, and counselors whom all of you have met behind the screens— are up to share priceless insights that will shape your next four years in India.
1/2/24, 3:38 PM - Sharda Edoofa: *We'd like to reserve your seats in advance. Could you please let us know how many people you'll be coming with? This will help us allocate the right number of slots for you.*

I recommend bringing your parents and guardians to the event. They play a crucial role in your education decisions. This event offers them a chance to understand the program and witness the journeys of past students, providing valuable insights for your higher education journey in India. So, get ready for this epic adventure, and I'll share the details with you super soon!
2/2/24, 11:05 AM - +263 71 400 8155: Good morning to you....we are all doing great
