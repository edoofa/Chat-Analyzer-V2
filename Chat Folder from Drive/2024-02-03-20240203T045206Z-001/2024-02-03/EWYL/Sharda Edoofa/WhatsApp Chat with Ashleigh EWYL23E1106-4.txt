As we embark on our session today, I'd like to share an inspiring quote that resonates deeply with our journey:

*"Life is 10% what happens to us and 90% how we react to it."*

This profound wisdom reminds us that while we may encounter various challenges, our power lies in how we respond and navigate through them. It's a testament to the resilience within each of us, shaping not just the path we walk but also the person we become.
18/1/24, 8:37 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Thank you so much for your kind words.
18/1/24, 9:27 AM - Sharda Edoofa: I am unhappy with your absense in today's session.

I will be under a lot of pressure in the morning so if we change the time it will be better. That is if it's good for you

27/1/24, 8:38 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *Greetings of the day, Ashleigh*
I hope this message finds you in good spirits. I want to share some heartfelt news with you. After careful consideration, I've come to a decision that carries a mix of emotions. *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor.*

As we journey through this moment, I can't help but feel a mix of emotions realizing that our daily interactions are about to change. *Saying goodbye to our current way of connecting brings a bittersweet feeling*, but deep down, I see change as a chance for growth and the discovery of new opportunities.

Reflecting on our shared journey, I am truly humbled by the extraordinary moments we've experienced together—the bonds we've forged, the shared laughter, and the countless instances of mutual growth and learning.
27/1/24, 8:39 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

Thank you for being an integral part of my life's journey. Keep radiating brilliance, dare to dream ambitiously, and always remember the remarkable potential within you. 
*I want to assure you that the mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
27/1/24, 2:51 PM - +263 77 266 0042: Aaah that's bad news Sharda ! You will be greatly missed! However there is need for personal growth in your career too. Wish you the best in your career journey We part to meet and we meet to part.Ashleigh's mother
