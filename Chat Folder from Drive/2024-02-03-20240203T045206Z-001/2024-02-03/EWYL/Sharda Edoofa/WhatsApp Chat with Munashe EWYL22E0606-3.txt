6/1/24, 1:36 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Good day Munashe
I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:40 PM - Sharda Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
15/1/24, 10:45 AM - Sharda Edoofa: kindly excuse the basic confusion - *the session is scheduled with you at the usual time which is from 12:00PM.* Please be available at the scheduled time.
15/1/24, 10:46 AM - +263 78 530 5332: Okay noted
15/1/24, 12:45 PM - +263 78 530 5332: <Media omitted>

27/1/24, 8:57 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *Greetings of the day, Munashe*
I hope this message finds you in good spirits. I want to share some heartfelt news with you. After careful consideration, I've come to a decision that carries a mix of emotions. *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor.*

As we journey through this moment, I can't help but feel a mix of emotions realizing that our daily interactions are about to change. *Saying goodbye to our current way of connecting brings a bittersweet feeling*, but deep down, I see change as a chance for growth and the discovery of new opportunities.

Reflecting on our shared journey, I am truly humbled by the extraordinary moments we've experienced together—the bonds we've forged, the shared laughter, and the countless instances of mutual growth and learning.
27/1/24, 8:59 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

Thank you for being an integral part of my life's journey. Keep radiating brilliance, dare to dream ambitiously, and always remember the remarkable potential within you. 
*I want to assure you that the mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
27/1/24, 10:36 AM - +263 78 530 5332: Greetings ma'am

I trust this message finds you well. Today, I want to take a moment to celebrate the exceptional bond that has been fostered between you and your former mentor, Ms. Sharda. We truly appreciate the positive impact she has had on your journey with us.

As the Head of the Department, I want to assure you that it is our top priority to ensure a smooth transition for you and to maintain the momentum of your learning and growth. While we are actively searching for a new mentor to guide you further, I have taken up the responsibility of being available to you in case of any queries or assistance required.

Moving forward, I have a very exciting new update to share with you, which would be a big milestone for you on your personal journey with Edoofa

31/1/24, 8:17 AM - Sanjana Edoofa: Good Morning!
Hope you are well.

I believe you're ready to commence the training session for being the Coordinator at the Meet and Greet that is just a few days from now!✨
*Let's catch up later today for a call at 2:30 PM to discuss the event details* and ensure it becomes an unforgettable experience, making your contribution stand out in the memory of all of Africa. 🌍🚀
31/1/24, 8:19 AM - +263 78 530 5332: Greetings ma'am and yes please I'm ready for the training session thank you

I wish you good luck ahead. Way to go, my Proud Edoofian!!
31/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 78 530 5332: Good afternoon ma'am and yes thank you for the information
31/1/24, 3:11 PM - +263 78 530 5332: Greetings ma'am yes ma'am i attended the training session for today and I learnt from Ms. Tushti that we are all part of the edoofa organising team now that we have been selected to be representives of Edoofa family. She also posted a task to us that we are to self analyse ourselves so that we see our strengths and weaknesses and we choose the roles we believe are best suited to us for this event. Well ma'am I for one believe I'm so good at connecting with people from different parts of the country and world in general since I'm patient and slow to anger . I'm adaptive to many tasks assigned to me that is i can uptake any task be it video filming or any other task but I would be at best if I'm to be an usher at the event. I also learnt that apart from making this event worth it we don't have to be so strict about perfection and should not worry about failure because it will be part of learning. This further increased my enthusiasm for up taking my part at the event. Furthermore, I'm going to be accompanied by my friends and cousins who are also eager to learn more about the Edoofa scholarship program.This is my feedback from today's session ma'am. Thank you <This message was edited>

1/2/24, 9:52 AM - +263 78 530 5332: Yes i did attend the meeting yesterday and in the webinar the presenter was presenting on the usefulness of AI(artificial intelligence) in the today's livelihood and how it has impacted the job market. In context he spoke of chat GPT and how it has assisted and is continuously assisting students as well as working class people of the society to carry out their tasks such as writing essays. However he also pointed out the flaws of the same AI too that it is not always accurate as sometimes it can have biased information. In case of using facts ,he suggested students and people consider using the AI tool called perplexity. Furthermore,he pointed out the jobs that are on the line of becoming redundant prior to AI. Examples of such jobs involve jobs which are centrally based on calculations, repeated tasks ETC. Afterwards,he shed more light on upcoming jobs which are emerging as a result of AI such as prompt engineering, AI coach, etc. He advised that students be well versed with the use of AI tools so that in the future they are not made redundant in their fields of work due to AI.
