I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝

When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨

27/1/24, 8:15 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *Greetings of the day, Salome*
I hope this message finds you in good spirits. I want to share some heartfelt news with you. After careful consideration, I've come to a decision that carries a mix of emotions. *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor.*

As we journey through this moment, I can't help but feel a mix of emotions realizing that our daily interactions are about to change. *Saying goodbye to our current way of connecting brings a bittersweet feeling*, but deep down, I see change as a chance for growth and the discovery of new opportunities.

Reflecting on our shared journey, I am truly humbled by the extraordinary moments we've experienced together—the bonds we've forged, the shared laughter, and the countless instances of mutual growth and learning.
27/1/24, 8:23 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

Thank you for being an integral part of my life's journey. Keep radiating brilliance, dare to dream ambitiously, and always remember the remarkable potential within you. 
*I want to assure you that the mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*

1/2/24, 11:47 PM - +263 77 718 4357: Good Evening.

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to express my deepest gratitude for the opportunity to be part of this scholarship group and for the support I have received during my time here.

Regrettably, I must inform you that I am unable to continue participating in the group and carrying out the projects as originally planned.l noticed that you have sent another messages without responding me, anyways its okey. I have recently been faced with significant work pressure that requires my undivided attention. Additionally, my parents and  l are facing certain financial challenges that make it difficult for me to commit the necessary time and resources to fulfill the obligations within the group.

I truly appreciate the guidance, mentorship, and camaraderie I have experienced within this wonderful community, and it is with a heavy heart that I have come to this decision. I have learned so much from each and every one of you, and I am truly grateful for the knowledge and networking opportunities I have gained.

I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused by my departure, and I understand the importance of fulfilling commitments. If there are any outstanding tasks or responsibilities that need to be addressed due to my departure, please let me know, and I will do my best to assist in finding a suitable solution or alternative.

Once again, I want to thank you all for your support and understanding. I wish the group continued success in all its endeavors and hope that our paths may cross again in the future.

Warm regards,

Salome Mandiveyi .
