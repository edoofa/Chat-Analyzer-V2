2/2/24, 9:23 AM - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning, Rumbidzaishe, 

This is a message from the Edoofa Academic Board. We understand that circumstances led you to delay your higher education journey as of last year, after taking a significant step towards building your future through us and I am sure that you must have been in touch with our Admissions team to figure out the best available solutions for you. Since then, Edoofa has been on a journey of innovation, creating new opportunities of learning and growth for students like you!

While I was going through your conversation, It reminded me of how I started my education journey full of questions and aspirations, and therefore I wanted to check in and have a conversation about how are you doing currently. 

May I know how are you planning to move your journey ahead?
