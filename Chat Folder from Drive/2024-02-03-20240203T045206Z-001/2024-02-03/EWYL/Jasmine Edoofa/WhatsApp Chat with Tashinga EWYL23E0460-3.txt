I trust this message finds you well and that your day has been delightful thus far.

29/1/24, 9:49 AM - Sanjana Edoofa: *Good Morning Tashinga*,
I am thrilled to share some incredible news with you - after careful consideration and discussions about your performance in the EWYL Program, you have been selected to take on *the role of Event Coordinator for Edoofa's upcoming Meet & Greet in Zimbabwe* that is due in a few days! Congratulations on this well-deserved opportunity!🥳

This is no ordinary event; _we are expecting a gathering of 5000 people_, and we believe in your ability to not just meet but exceed the responsibilities that come with this role. ⭐

This role is not mandatory but rather an invitation for you to explore and consider. As one of the Event Coordinators, it's a chance for you to showcase your *leadership skills, problem-solving abilities, and creativity* on a grand scale. Apart from this, you will also have *the golden opportunity to collaborate with Edoofa’s Team, work closely with Mr. Angad Singh*, and contribute significantly to the success of this huge event! 🎯
29/1/24, 9:49 AM - Sanjana Edoofa: I know you must be feeling butterflies in your stomach, along with a lot of questions in your mind. Well, to clear all your doubts regarding this opportunity we have scheduled a video call with all the students who have been given this opportunity *today at 2:30 PM CAT.* If you have any questions or if there's anything you'd like to discuss, please note it down so that it can be addressed over the call. 🚨

Congratulations once again, and let's make this event an unforgettable experience for everyone involved!💯✨

30/1/24, 11:22 AM - Sanjana Edoofa: Good morning, Tashinga, let us connect over a call today since you were unable to join yesterday. The time would be 2:30 pm CAT
30/1/24, 1:36 PM - +263 71 388 4330: Good afternoon ma'am ... I'm unable to connect with you today . My apologies for the inconvenience
30/1/24, 2:07 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Hello, Tashinga!
I hope you are doing well. I understand you were unable to join the call yesterday due to certain challenges. However, since you have shown enthusiasm for this role and for our event, I thought I'd personally reach out to you and bring you upto speed about the discussion I had yesterday with all the students who have been chosen to become a coordinator along with you. Together, you and your co-Edoofians shall be managing an event that would have a footfall of around *5000 participants*. This will undoubtedly be one of the biggest events you ever attend in your academic or professional life. This is the first time that an event of such scale is being conducted in Zimbabwe. In fact, you'd be surprised to know that we had to really struggle to find a suitable venue for such a big event in all of Harare. 

Now, while I know that it is challenging for you to attend each training session, I would not want you to miss out on the oppurtunity of being a part of this mega event, so please do try and participate in as many training calls and sessions in the upcoming days as you can- there will be a lot to learn!! I look forward to seeing you soon!
