23/12/23, 2:35 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 3:07 PM - +263 71 303 5080: Thank you man
23/12/23, 3:26 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that now we will be meeting on *Tuesday i.e. 26-Dec-2023 for your session from 1:30 pm - 3:30 pm* (African Time)

*Keeping your routine in mind, I've shifted our session timings for a more productive engagement.*
I would appreciate your acknowledgment of this message and confirmation of your understanding of the *new session timings*
23/12/23, 3:27 PM - +263 71 303 5080: Ok mam
26/12/23, 1:39 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good afternoon, Edward,_*👋🏼
Before delving into your Christmas celebrations, I'd like to bring your attention to the session timings. 
Considering your hectic schedule, I've made some adjustments to our timetable.

*From now onwards, our sessions will take place from Monday to Friday, spanning from 1:30 pm to 3:30 pm*. Yes, we've extended the session to 2 hours for a more productive interaction. 

So are you excited about the session?
26/12/23, 1:58 PM - +263 71 303 5080: Yes
26/12/23, 2:00 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So before we start, I couldn't stop myself but ask, how was your Christmas? 🌲
26/12/23, 2:03 PM - +263 71 303 5080: Was very fyn and yours
26/12/23, 2:10 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: That is great to know. You know this year, I spent a quiet and reflective time with my family, cherishing the festive spirit. We gathered for a festive meal, exchanged heartfelt gifts, and shared stories. 
The holiday season is a wonderful time to appreciate the warmth of family and friends
26/12/23, 2:29 PM - +263 71 303 5080: Wow wonderful
26/12/23, 2:34 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Thank you, dear. Last time we discussed Project 3

Do you remember?
26/12/23, 2:40 PM - +263 71 303 5080: Yes
26/12/23, 2:41 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
26/12/23, 2:42 PM - +263 71 303 5080: Yeah
26/12/23, 2:43 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
26/12/23, 3:52 PM - +263 71 303 5080: I have it
26/12/23, 9:31 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: So now it is time to wrap up the session. It was lovely talking to you. 

*Now we will meet tomorrow from 1:30 pm to 3:30 pm*
I want you to inculcate the habit of joining the session on your own and just give a quick "I'm here" when you're online at 1:30 pm. 
Can I expect this from you?
26/12/23, 9:32 PM - +263 71 303 5080: Yes
26/12/23, 9:32 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.
Goodnight Edward

Do you remember?
28/12/23, 2:32 PM - +263 71 303 5080: Yes
28/12/23, 2:33 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Well, Done on sharing the form 🌟 
It has been shared with our dedicated counseling team. In the meantime, it is crucial that you maintain regular communication with the student and address any queries they may have. Our counseling team will be reaching out to them directly within the next 15-20 days.
28/12/23, 2:33 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?

28/12/23, 3:02 PM - +263 71 303 5080: Ok mam
28/12/23, 3:03 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
28/12/23, 3:04 PM - +263 71 303 5080: It’s  school fees is 420
28/12/23, 3:09 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: That will work, Edward
28/12/23, 3:09 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
28/12/23, 3:09 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: 1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them

We want to build a habit of coming to the EWYL LINE every day and chanting the mantra.
28/12/23, 3:55 PM - +263 71 303 5080: Ok ok
28/12/23, 3:56 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. It fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day.

Let us start today's session with a fun question -

If you could create a new country on any unclaimed land in the world, what would you name it, and what values or principles would be the foundation of your utopian society?
29/12/23, 2:43 PM - +263 71 303 5080: I would name it possland 
The principles of that country would be free education 
No corruption 
 And  it would  base a  foundation on the young
29/12/23, 2:45 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: "Posslаnd" is a creative and intriguing name for a utopian society, and the principles you've outlined—free education, no corruption, and a foundation based on the young—paint a vision of a society that values education, integrity, and youth empowerment.

29/12/23, 3:12 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Generally, it takes around 5-7 days to receive the letter from the University, however, as you are aware the Universities are on break now due to Christmas and New Year, so it might take a little longer. I, however, would encourage you to please connect with your Admission Officer and confirm the same, they will be able to give you the correct timeline.
29/12/23, 3:13 PM - +263 71 303 5080: Ok mam
29/12/23, 3:16 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Now it is time to wrap up the session. As we are going to embark on a new chapter at the dawn of the New Year, I really wanted to send my warmest wishes your way. 
_May this coming year be filled with joy, laughter, and moments of profound happiness_ 🌈

Along with you, the Edoofa Family will also be occupied in *New Year Celebrations from tomorrow till 1 January 2024* and we will *resume from 2 January onwards*🎉

I hope you are doing well.

Tomorrow, I'll be occupied organizing an industrial visit for our students here in India, and as a result, there won't be a session. I really appreciate your understanding.

*Now, I will meet you in our next session*
Have a great evening!
3/1/24, 6:25 PM - +263 71 303 5080: Ok
6/1/24, 4:03 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Good Afternoon my lovely student*_
I wanted to share some exciting news with you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 4:04 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. 

*When we connect on the 11th of January at 7::00 pm,* I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨

*Now, Since it will be a long break, I want you to work hard on the projects and submit 7 applications to me on Thursday.* 
Give it your 100% and I know you can do this. Take care
6/1/24, 4:05 PM - +263 71 303 5080: Ok man
6/1/24, 4:05 PM - +263 71 303 5080: *m

Kindly excuse me for the delay in my response. Following the event, I experienced a fever and had to be on bed rest for a couple of days.

Let me share the scoop on *Slice Con'24—it was seriously awesome!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️

I trust this message finds you well and that your day has been delightful thus far. 
I hope you recall the times when I encouraged you to pursue your dreams passionately and put in the hard work to see them come to fruition. 🎓

*Today, with a heavy heart yet fortified by courage, I am sharing with you my decision to step back from my role as your mentor.* It is not without sincere consideration, and I want you to know that your growth and success have always been my utmost priority.

You know, my dream has always been to embark on a journey of higher studies, aiming to obtain a PhD in chemistry from abroad. *While this means I must bid farewell as your mentor, Believe me, I am doing so with the conviction that the next individual stepping into this role will be of equal or even greater caliber. I trust they will guide you with the same dedication, enabling you to achieve your dreams.*
17/1/24, 9:14 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I have no doubt that you will continue to make me proud, fostering a bond with your new mentor built on honesty and commitment. 

*The mentorship team will be in touch with you to discuss the plan going forward.*

As I pen down this closing message, my heart is filled with gratitude for the journey we've shared. I am confident that the next chapter with your new mentor will be marked by growth, support, and achievements that surpass even our fondest expectations. ❤️

Wishing you all the best on your continued journey, and I look forward to hearing about your future successes.🫱🏼‍🫲🏾

I hope this message finds you well. In today's Wednesday lesson, we'll delve into the impactful realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and computer technology in the context of saving lives. We'll explore how innovative solutions are leveraging these technologies to make a significant difference in healthcare.

Furthermore, we'll discuss a noteworthy case study involving a startup from Zambia that has effectively translated the concept of using AI and computer technology into practical applications for improving healthcare outcomes.
