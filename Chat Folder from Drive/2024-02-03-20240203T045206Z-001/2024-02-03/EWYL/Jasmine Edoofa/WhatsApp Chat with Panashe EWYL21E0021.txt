This is an official message from the Edoofa Academic Board! I hope you are having a great time and you are doing well in your academic journey. You know, while I was going through the students' conversations with our mentors, I saw how you were communicating with your mentor Ms. Jasmine earlier. 

While I was going through your conversation, It reminded me of how I started my education journey full of questions and aspirations, and therefore I wanted to check in and have a conversation about how are you doing currently. Have you started with your higher educational journey?
