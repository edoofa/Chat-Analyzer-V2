23/12/23, 4:49 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: It's been quite some time since our last connection. As we approach the end of the year, I genuinely want to know what is stopping you from active participation in the Earn While You Learn Program. 

Considering you joined the Edoofa Scholarship program with the dream of pursuing higher education, I'm genuinely curious about your plans now, especially given the missed sessions. Your dreams really matter, and I'd love to understand how I can best support you in achieving them.
I am really looking forward to hearing from you ☺️

24/12/23, 9:17 PM - +263 73 341 6709: Greetings.

Thank you for your concern. Unfortunately Elton is showing little interest in studying abroad and as his parents we can only guide him but can't force him. Thank you once again

 Great news – there's a reserved spot just for you in the registration process! 
We understand that sometimes deadlines can be challenging to meet. Missing the registration fee deadline might seem like a roadblock, however, it isn't yet! Your dedication matters the most to us.

I am sure that your admissions officers must have already taken the first steps, and as a mentor, it is my advice to you to have transparency in your conversations so that we can help you fulfill your goal of arriving in India for your higher education! ✅

There’s a catch! You now have a chance to fast-track your admissions process and meet your officers too! 😀
2/2/24, 8:59 AM - Jasmine Edoofa: Join our unique event in Harare with 5000+ participants for a meet & greet, Q&A, and fast-track admission to your journey to India. Bring your parents for a deeper understanding of the program. *To secure your seats, kindly let us know how many seats shall be reserved for you.*✨
