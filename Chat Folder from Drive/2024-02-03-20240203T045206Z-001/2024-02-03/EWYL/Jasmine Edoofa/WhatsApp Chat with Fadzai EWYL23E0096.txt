*Keeping your routine in mind, I've shifted our session timings for a more productive engagement.* I've noticed that you were going through several challenges leading to your absence from recent sessions, and I want you to know that I understand. That's why I've adjusted the session timings. Now before our next session, I'd appreciate it if you could answer the following:

▪️Could you share the reasons behind your recent session absences?
▪️Are you confident in your understanding of all the EWYL projects? If so, which one is your favorite project?
▪️Can you promise 🤞🏼 to attend every session moving forward?
I would appreciate your acknowledgment of this message and confirmation of your understanding of the *new session timings.* <This message was edited>

2/2/24, 9:24 AM - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning, Fadzai, 

This is a message from the Edoofa Academic Board. We understand that circumstances led you to delay your higher education journey as of last year, after taking a significant step towards building your future through us and I am sure that you must have been in touch with our Admissions team to figure out the best available solutions for you. Since then, Edoofa has been on a journey of innovation, creating new opportunities of learning and growth for students like you!

While I was going through your conversation, It reminded me of how I started my education journey full of questions and aspirations, and therefore I wanted to check in and have a conversation about how are you doing currently. 

May I know how are you planning to move your journey ahead?
