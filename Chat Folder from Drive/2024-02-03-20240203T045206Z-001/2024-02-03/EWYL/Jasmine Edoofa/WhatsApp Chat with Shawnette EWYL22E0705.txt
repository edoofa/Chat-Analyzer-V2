Considering you joined the Edoofa Scholarship program with the dream of pursuing higher education, I'm genuinely curious about your plans now, especially given the missed sessions. Your dreams really matter, and I'd love to understand how I can best support you in achieving them.
I am really looking forward to hearing from you ☺️

This is a message from the Edoofa Academic Board. We understand that circumstances led you to delay your higher education journey as of last year, after taking a significant step towards building your future through us and I am sure that you must have been in touch with our Admissions team to figure out the best available solutions for you. Since then, Edoofa has been on a journey of innovation, creating new opportunities of learning and growth for students like you!

While I was going through your conversation, It reminded me of how I started my education journey full of questions and aspirations, and therefore I wanted to check in and have a conversation about how are you doing currently. 

May I know how are you planning to move your journey ahead?
