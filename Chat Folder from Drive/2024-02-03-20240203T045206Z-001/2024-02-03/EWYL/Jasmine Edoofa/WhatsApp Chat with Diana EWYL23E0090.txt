Considering you joined the Edoofa Scholarship program with the dream of pursuing higher education, I'm genuinely curious about your plans now, especially given the missed sessions. Your dreams really matter, and I'd love to understand how I can best support you in achieving them.
I am really looking forward to hearing from you ☺️

I hope this message finds you well. In today's Wednesday lesson, we'll delve into the impactful realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and computer technology in the context of saving lives. We'll explore how innovative solutions are leveraging these technologies to make a significant difference in healthcare.

Furthermore, we'll discuss a noteworthy case study involving a startup from Zambia that has effectively translated the concept of using AI and computer technology into practical applications for improving healthcare outcomes. I encourage you to read the provided PDF carefully, as it promises to open your mind to multiple opportunities within this dynamic field.

This lesson aims not only to broaden your understanding of the transformative potential of technology in healthcare but also to inspire you to explore ways you can contribute within your capacities. Feel free to come prepared with questions and ideas for a lively and engaging discussion.

Looking forward to an enlightening session!

Best regards,
Team EWYL
