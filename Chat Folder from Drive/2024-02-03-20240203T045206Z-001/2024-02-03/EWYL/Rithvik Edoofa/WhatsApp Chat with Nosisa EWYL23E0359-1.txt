6/1/24, 1:53 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Good day Nosisa
I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:57 PM - Sharda Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
22/1/24, 8:10 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Good evening, Nosisa

I am thrilled to share with you that a very special opportunity awaits you tomorrow. I have managed to schedule a special one on one session with the *Program Head Ms Sanjana.* The session would be held from *1:30 pm to 3 pm CAT*. This is one opportunity I do not wish for you to miss, so do ensure you are online and prepared with your questions on time!!

The time slot has been very carefully decided, keeping in mind the fact that most students are usually available during their lunch breaks or after school.
22/1/24, 8:52 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Ok ma'am
22/1/24, 8:52 PM - +263 78 035 0406: I will be there
22/1/24, 9:33 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Happy to share my results with you
22/1/24, 9:33 PM - +263 78 035 0406: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 1:38 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Good afternoon
23/1/24, 1:46 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Nosisa
How are you doing today?
23/1/24, 1:47 PM - +263 78 035 0406: I am fine
23/1/24, 1:48 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Glad to know, Nosisa
23/1/24, 1:49 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: I was just going through your result. I am happy to see your grades!
Congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.
23/1/24, 1:49 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: How did your family react to this, Nosisa?
23/1/24, 1:53 PM - +263 78 035 0406: They were so excited
23/1/24, 1:56 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Very well! You should be proud of yourself, Nosisa
23/1/24, 1:56 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Indeed
23/1/24, 2:12 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Nosisa, I was actually having a discussion with Ms. Sharda earlier about your performance in the EWYL Program. We walked through your entire performance and I see a lot of positive intent and willingness towards your higher education.
23/1/24, 2:12 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Why don't you share with me the expectations that you have from the EWYL program further and how is it that you plan to utilize your mentor in the same?
23/1/24, 2:16 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Ok , the EWYL program is good
23/1/24, 2:17 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Because it can help to reduce ones fees
23/1/24, 2:17 PM - +263 78 035 0406: I would like to work with my mentor hand in gloove even at my arrival there
23/1/24, 2:29 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: I appreciate your clarity of purpose here, Nosisa. Our goal and feeling is mutual. I would absolutely want you to be consistent in your sessions with the EWYL team and ensure that you are working on the projects that have been assigned to you.

On the same lines, why don't you walk me through your progress that you have made until now?
23/1/24, 2:32 PM - +263 78 035 0406: No. Progress yet
23/1/24, 2:32 PM - +263 78 035 0406: But I promise soon
23/1/24, 2:39 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Sure, Nosisa. That is alright. However, please understand that the most important aim that I have for my students is to ensure that they earn the maximum amount of scholarship credits so that they can self finance their education moving forward.
The aim would only be a wish if actions do not justify the aspirations that one might carry. Hence, I would want you to carefully focus on working on the projects regularly to achieve outcomes.
23/1/24, 2:39 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: I hope that you understand?
23/1/24, 2:44 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Yes maam
23/1/24, 2:44 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Thank you
23/1/24, 2:51 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Lovely, I would be closely monitoring your performance.
23/1/24, 2:56 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Ok maam
23/1/24, 3:03 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: On similar lines, I had a discussion with your admissions team and was made aware that you are mid way through your journey of coming to India by completing some part of your registration formalities. Congratulations! How are you and your family feeling about that?
23/1/24, 3:04 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Happy
23/1/24, 3:27 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: In recent years, Edoofa has come to be synonymous with events and seminars that are conducted on a grand scale, and has attempted to deepen the impact it leaves on the students who choose to be a part of the same. 

I wanted to personally share with you that in the upcoming weeks, we shall have the most esteemed members of Team Edoofa visiting various countries all over Africa, with the sole aim to connect with and inspire students such as yourself, and to guide them on their quest to build meaningful careers and await you on your journey to India. They shall also connect with *visionaries, educationists, industrialists, school headmasters, principals to share learnings and collaborate in ways that benefit the learners like you!* ⭐
23/1/24, 3:27 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: I hope this sounds interesting to you?
23/1/24, 3:46 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Yes it does
23/1/24, 5:16 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: I am glad to know that, Nosisa. With such little time that awaits you towards your arrival in India, I hope that you are all geared up.
23/1/24, 5:16 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: It was truly wonderful speaking to you today. It is now time to conclude the session. I am glad that I got an opportunity to connect with you today, and look forward to having more such sessions wherein I can gain more insight into your experiences of being a Proud Edoofian! Take care of yourself, work hard, the sky is the limit! 

Do ensure you stay connected with the EWYL Team to know your schedule further. Have a great day ahead!

27/1/24, 9:23 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *Greetings of the day, Nosisa*
I hope this message finds you in good spirits. I want to share some heartfelt news with you. After careful consideration, I've come to a decision that carries a mix of emotions. *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor.*

As we journey through this moment, I can't help but feel a mix of emotions realizing that our daily interactions are about to change. *Saying goodbye to our current way of connecting brings a bittersweet feeling*, but deep down, I see change as a chance for growth and the discovery of new opportunities.

Reflecting on our shared journey, I am truly humbled by the extraordinary moments we've experienced together—the bonds we've forged, the shared laughter, and the countless instances of mutual growth and learning.
27/1/24, 9:25 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

Thank you for being an integral part of my life's journey. Keep radiating brilliance, dare to dream ambitiously, and always remember the remarkable potential within you. 
*I want to assure you that the mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*

2/2/24, 4:44 PM - Rithvik Edoofa: Hi Nosisa,

I'm Mr. Rithvik, HOD of the Department of Student Welfare at Edoofa. Exciting news – you're officially invited to our massive Meet and Greet Event in Harare this February!


As the countdown to your 🇮🇳 India journey ticks away, with just a quarter left (approximately 3 to 4 months! 😄) before you step into this new adventure, I understand that the chaos and preparations might be swirling around you. Let's navigate through this excitement together. Here is an amazing opportunity for you as our Founder & CEO Mr. Angad, along with the admission officers and counselors (whom you have only met virtually until now, exciting right?) are coming to Zimbabwe for an exclusive annual meet & greet!
2/2/24, 4:44 PM - Rithvik Edoofa: With more than 5000 people participating, an event of this magnitude has never happened in Zimbabwe before. This meet & greet is going to be truly unique that Harare has ever seen. We present to you a fantastic opportunity for you to ask questions, address your concerns/queries, fast-track your admission process, and gain clarity about your journey to India. This event is just the beginning of a magical journey, offering you a glimpse into your future brimming with opportunities that would consist of discussions on industrial academia, the scope of your chosen field of study, and following your higher education.
2/2/24, 4:44 PM - Rithvik Edoofa: I would strongly recommend bringing your parents and guardians with you to the event! In your journey of life, they are the most integral part and of course decision-makers in your entire course of education. As you are just one step away from starting your higher education, this event would provide you with an opportunity to witness the path that unfolds for you in the next three to five years here in India - an opportunity for them to actively be a part of your potential journey, gain a deeper understanding towards the entire program and witness the journey of your senior Edoofians!
2/2/24, 4:44 PM - Rithvik Edoofa: Get ready for this adventure, and I'm genuinely happy that you're going to be part of such a phenomenal event! ✨
We'd like to reserve your seats in advance. Could you please let us know how many people you'll be coming with? This will help us allocate the right slots for you.
