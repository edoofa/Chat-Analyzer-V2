28/12/23, 3:12 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Please note that the following schedule will be implemented once we have completed our current phase of learning about all the projects.
For the time being, *Our sessions will be held every day from 1:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. from Monday to Friday*
28/12/23, 3:13 PM - +263 78 092 6205: Understood
28/12/23, 3:16 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: So, During your EWYL Journey

1. You will be meeting me two days a week. It can be either Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday.
2. You will be getting the lesson of the week, or as we call it *Wednesday Wisdom*, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity which I will share on Saturday.

Now what you learn through the theory of Wednesday wisdom, you will be implementing the same in our Saturday Activities, these will be simple yet testing tasks that you are required to complete. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the *lesson and activity* on the respective days.
28/12/23, 3:38 PM - +263 78 092 6205: Okay I understand
28/12/23, 3:45 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So now it's time to wrap up the session. Now we will meet tomorrow from 1:30 pm to 3:30 pm

Make sure that you come to the session on your own and address your presence. 
Have a wonderful day ahead!
28/12/23, 3:54 PM - +263 78 092 6205: What I don't understand is earlier you indicated that we have sessions everyday from 1:30-3:30 everyday and you are now saying the schedule is two days a week, I'm getting confused would you kindly explain that for me.
28/12/23, 3:54 PM - +263 78 092 6205: Okay thank you
28/12/23, 3:56 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>

28/12/23, 3:57 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Welcome Bradley
29/12/23, 1:41 PM - +263 78 092 6205: Good afternoon Ms Jasmine
29/12/23, 2:29 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Good Afternoon Bradley*_
Let us start today's session with a fun question -

If you could create a new country on any unclaimed land in the world, what would you name it, and what values or principles would be the foundation of your utopian society?
29/12/23, 3:11 PM - +263 78 092 6205: I have three names in mind right now. So I'll submit the three names 


My first name would be *Metropolis* . Metropolis is a fictional city in comics and it symbolises hope and strength. It would be a futuristic land which is highly technologically advanced, with towering skyscrapers  and it would be the leader in Science and Technology.

The second name I would choose is *Earth* . It would be a land that mainly focuses on correcting everything that is currently wrong on planet Earth right now. It would offer affordable and yet quality education to its people. Earth would also be focused on reducing global warming and making our planet safer.

The last name I would choose is *The Future* I think the name is  quite fitting as if I were to create a new country today it would be the ahead of every other country in terms of everything. It would have state of the art technological advancements with futuristic building and structures. Its main focus would be science and technology development as that is the future of the human race.
29/12/23, 3:11 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Your choices of names—Metropolis, Earth, and The Future—reflect a thoughtful and visionary approach to creating utopian societies. Each name carries its own symbolic weight, and the principles outlined for each society showcase a commitment to progress, sustainability, and technological advancement.
29/12/23, 3:12 PM - +263 78 092 6205: Thank you very much
29/12/23, 3:16 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Now it is time to wrap up the session. As we are going to embark on a new chapter at the dawn of the New Year, I really wanted to send my warmest wishes your way. 
_May this coming year be filled with joy, laughter, and moments of profound happiness_ 🌈

Along with you, the Edoofa Family will also be occupied in *New Year Celebrations from tomorrow till 1 January 2024* and we will *resume from 2 January onwards*🎉

Wishing you a year ahead filled with love, prosperity, and the fulfillment of your heart's desires. May every day be a chance for you to shine and make a positive impact. ✨

Happy New Year in advance! 🎊
29/12/23, 3:17 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 3:21 PM - +263 78 092 6205: Thank you so much and Happy new year 🎊
2/1/24, 12:58 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good afternoon Bradley* 
I hope you are doing well. As we enter the new year, I wish for you that it brings abundant success, joy, and prosperity into your life.

*I would also like to remind you that our session is scheduled for today, starting at 1:30 pm and concluding at 3:30 pm.*

2/1/24, 1:40 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, we’re ready to begin your EWYL program, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me.

This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
2/1/24, 1:43 PM - +263 78 092 6205: Yes it's clear
2/1/24, 1:44 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/1/24, 1:44 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I want you to take today’s time, to go through the document, read about each, and every project in detail, and then answer some of my questions

1. Name all three projects.

2/1/24, 3:53 PM - +263 78 092 6205: 1. Corporate Alliances, Community Building and African School's Education Reform Mission.

2. Project 1 is on Corporate Alliances and its main focus is building a network of partner companies and potential employers. The student has to identify local organisations that meet the required standards and reach out to the decision makers and share The Edoofa Program's vision and aims. The student has to arrange a call with Edoofa and facilitate the signing of a contract if both parties come to an agreement. 

3. Project 2 is the Community Building project and its main focus is helping students acquire international education and prepare for their futures as they get the chance to be part of the Edoofa Program. This project requires a strong social media influence from the student in order to reach out to the community more effectively.


4. Project 3 involves reaching out to schools in my region, starting with my former school and speaking to the Headmasters or Principals or any decision makers. This is a tie up where Edoofa wants to help African Schools improve their education delivery and outcome, offer career counseling to children and also offer scholarship opportunities to the students, training teachers and making a collaboration between top Indian schools and their African counterparts.
2/1/24, 9:33 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Job, Bradley. 
We will discuss more about this in our session tomorrow
2/1/24, 9:48 PM - +263 78 092 6205: Okay
3/1/24, 1:27 PM - +263 78 092 6205: Good afternoon, I'm here
3/1/24, 1:39 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Afternoon*
I hope you are doing well. Let us start our session with a fun question

If your pet could suddenly talk for one day, what do you think they would say or ask you?
3/1/24, 1:46 PM - +263 78 092 6205: Yes I am okay, how are you?

I think they would want to know what being a human feels like.
3/1/24, 1:48 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I am very well. Thank you for asking 😊
3/1/24, 1:48 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: That's a fascinating perspective!
3/1/24, 1:48 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Today, I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
3/1/24, 1:48 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
3/1/24, 1:51 PM - +263 78 092 6205: Okay Ms Jasmine
3/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 78 092 6205: I understood that.
3/1/24, 2:07 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
3/1/24, 2:22 PM - +263 78 092 6205: People are relying more on technology and this offers the opportunity to connect with companies that are digital and technically driven. I have to identify these companies and reach out to them and explain how Edoofa is helping me develop the necessary skills for future employment. I would have to create a LinkedIn account to help me connect with professionals and managers in the industry, to have conversations and gather their contact details.
3/1/24, 2:29 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Amazing, thanks Bradley. I’m happy with your understanding. So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
3/1/24, 2:29 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
3/1/24, 2:33 PM - +263 78 092 6205: Okay.
3/1/24, 2:35 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you could briefly summarize your understanding of it.
3/1/24, 2:56 PM - +263 78 092 6205: I have to look for potential companies that are willing to collaborate with Edoofa and are willing to help in the development of all students enrolled in the Edoofa Programme. I have to study the nature of the company and it must be student centric. I also have to study the scale of the company and it should have 50-200 employees and the company should have financial stability. I should also look at the background of the Founders and reach out to the heads of departments such as Marketing managers before reaching out to the Founders
3/1/24, 2:57 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: You know what Bradley, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
3/1/24, 2:57 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –

3/1/24, 3:05 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Now it is time to wrap up the session. It was lovely talking to you today. 

Tomorrow, I'll be occupied organizing an industrial visit for our students here in India, and as a result, there won't be a session. I really appreciate your understanding.

5/1/24, 1:48 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, Let us discuss how we can find suitable companies.
5/1/24, 1:48 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: We can utilize platforms like Google, Instagram, Facebook, and most importantly LinkedIn to assist us in finding suitable companies.

Instagram Username:

LinkedIn Profile Link:
5/1/24, 1:51 PM - +263 78 092 6205: Okay

I wanted to share some exciting news with you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:33 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. 

*When we connect on the 11th of January,* I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
6/1/24, 1:35 PM - +263 78 092 6205: Okay Ms Jasmine I understand

Kindly excuse me for the delay in my response. Following the event, I experienced a fever and had to be on bed rest for a couple of days.

Let me share the scoop on *Slice Con'24—it was seriously awesome!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️

 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!

17/1/24, 2:20 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!

_Through WhatsApp community groups_
17/1/24, 2:20 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Kindly go through the audio that I am sharing below, After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you could briefly summarize your understanding of it.
17/1/24, 2:20 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/1/24, 2:20 PM - +263 78 092 6205: Okay
17/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 78 092 6205: I have to create a WhatsApp group and after that I have to identify the right students that can be part of the Edoofa Programme. I have to equip them with the necessary information they need before they begin their counseling session. Once I create the group I have to add you so that you monitor the progress.
17/1/24, 2:40 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Well Done Bradley, I am impressed with your understanding.
17/1/24, 2:40 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -

17/1/24, 2:40 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

I'm Mr. Rithvik, HOD of the Department of Student Welfare at Edoofa. Exciting news – you're officially invited to our massive Meet and Greet Event in Harare this February!


As the countdown to your 🇮🇳 India journey ticks away, with just a quarter left (approximately 3 to 4 months! 😄) before you step into this new adventure, I understand that the chaos and preparations might be swirling around you. Let's navigate through this excitement together. Here is an amazing opportunity for you as our Founder & CEO Mr. Angad, along with the admission officers and counselors (whom you have only met virtually until now, exciting right?) are coming to Zimbabwe for an exclusive annual meet & greet!
2/2/24, 4:52 PM - Rithvik Edoofa: With more than 5000 people participating, an event of this magnitude has never happened in Zimbabwe before. This meet & greet is going to be truly unique that Harare has ever seen. We present to you a fantastic opportunity for you to ask questions, address your concerns/queries, fast-track your admission process, and gain clarity about your journey to India. This event is just the beginning of a magical journey, offering you a glimpse into your future brimming with opportunities that would consist of discussions on industrial academia, the scope of your chosen field of study, and following your higher education.
2/2/24, 4:52 PM - Rithvik Edoofa: I would strongly recommend bringing your parents and guardians with you to the event! In your journey of life, they are the most integral part and of course decision-makers in your entire course of education. As you are just one step away from starting your higher education, this event would provide you with an opportunity to witness the path that unfolds for you in the next three to five years here in India - an opportunity for them to actively be a part of your potential journey, gain a deeper understanding towards the entire program and witness the journey of your senior Edoofians!
