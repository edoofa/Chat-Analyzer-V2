Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.

12/1/24, 2:16 PM - Saloni Edoofa: So Fumani, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
12/1/24, 2:26 PM - +263 77 341 0203: My long-term goal is to become a successful lawyer, driven by a passion for justice and advocacy. I aspire to specialize in a field that aligns with my values, such as human rights or environmental law. I envision contributing to positive social change through legal expertise and dedication to ethical principles. To achieve this, I plan to pursue a rigorous legal education, gain practical experience through internships, and build a strong professional network. Ultimately, I aim to make a meaningful impact in the legal realm, using my skills to address complex issues and uphold the principles of fairness and equality.

The Earn While You Learn program will provide financial support crucial to my educational journey. By simultaneously earning and learning, I can alleviate the burden of tuition and gain practical experience in my chosen field. This program ensures a smoother path towards my academic goals, fostering a balanced approach to education and career development.
12/1/24, 2:38 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am so excited to take forward with our discussions🫶🏻

15/1/24, 1:41 PM - +263 77 341 0203: Yes we may
15/1/24, 1:45 PM - Saloni Edoofa: This is amazing Fumani, I am so feeling happy to hear this🫶🏻
15/1/24, 1:45 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
15/1/24, 1:45 PM - +263 77 341 0203: Thank you very much
15/1/24, 1:46 PM - +263 77 341 0203: I would like to learn more about these two objectives
15/1/24, 2:02 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
15/1/24, 2:02 PM - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
15/1/24, 2:05 PM - +263 77 341 0203: Noted,thank you very much for the very clear and understandable explanation.
15/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 77 363 4425: Following
15/1/24, 2:14 PM - Saloni Edoofa: That is completely alright!
15/1/24, 2:14 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Let me share with you that Persistance, one of my students has _earned around 7,000 USD_ and paid his entire tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.

3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Fumani?

How are you doing?

19/1/24, 2:00 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, that’s wonderful. Fumani- I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
19/1/24, 2:13 PM - +263 77 341 0203: The above document is a list of projects and the requirements and skills required to complete the projects.The document also lists the steps and clear instructions on how to complete these projects.

I believe the above document  is also focused on improving one's skills in both physical and digital marketing,confidence and communication skills.The projects listed above require an outspoken and outgoing individual that is willing to put in a large amount of time into completing said projects and earning incentives from the work put in.
19/1/24, 2:49 PM - +263 77 363 4425: Good day

2/2/24, 4:53 PM - Rithvik Edoofa: Exclusive Invite to Edoofa's Mega Meet & Greet in Harare! 🌟
2/2/24, 4:53 PM - Rithvik Edoofa: Hi Fumani,

I'm Mr. Rithvik, HOD of the Department of Student Welfare at Edoofa. Exciting news – you're officially invited to our massive Meet and Greet Event in Harare this February!


As the countdown to your 🇮🇳 India journey ticks away, with just a quarter left (approximately 3 to 4 months! 😄) before you step into this new adventure, I understand that the chaos and preparations might be swirling around you. Let's navigate through this excitement together. Here is an amazing opportunity for you as our Founder & CEO Mr. Angad, along with the admission officers and counselors (whom you have only met virtually until now, exciting right?) are coming to Zimbabwe for an exclusive annual meet & greet!
2/2/24, 4:53 PM - Rithvik Edoofa: With more than 5000 people participating, an event of this magnitude has never happened in Zimbabwe before. This meet & greet is going to be truly unique that Harare has ever seen. We present to you a fantastic opportunity for you to ask questions, address your concerns/queries, fast-track your admission process, and gain clarity about your journey to India. This event is just the beginning of a magical journey, offering you a glimpse into your future brimming with opportunities that would consist of discussions on industrial academia, the scope of your chosen field of study, and following your higher education.
2/2/24, 4:53 PM - Rithvik Edoofa: I would strongly recommend bringing your parents and guardians with you to the event! In your journey of life, they are the most integral part and of course decision-makers in your entire course of education. As you are just one step away from starting your higher education, this event would provide you with an opportunity to witness the path that unfolds for you in the next three to five years here in India - an opportunity for them to actively be a part of your potential journey, gain a deeper understanding towards the entire program and witness the journey of your senior Edoofians!
2/2/24, 4:53 PM - Rithvik Edoofa: Get ready for this adventure, and I'm genuinely happy that you're going to be part of such a phenomenal event! ✨
We'd like to reserve your seats in advance. Could you please let us know how many people you'll be coming with? This will help us allocate the right slots for you.
2/2/24, 5:24 PM - +263 77 363 4425: Good day, l am Fumani Chauke's mother.
