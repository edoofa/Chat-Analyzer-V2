I hope this message finds you well. In today's Wednesday lesson, we'll delve into the impactful realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and computer technology in the context of saving lives. We'll explore how innovative solutions are leveraging these technologies to make a significant difference in healthcare.

Furthermore, we'll discuss a noteworthy case study involving a startup from Zambia that has effectively translated the concept of using AI and computer technology into practical applications for improving healthcare outcomes. I encourage you to read the provided PDF carefully, as it promises to open your mind to multiple opportunities within this dynamic field.

This lesson aims not only to broaden your understanding of the transformative potential of technology in healthcare but also to inspire you to explore ways you can contribute within your capacities. Feel free to come prepared with questions and ideas for a lively and engaging discussion.

2/2/24, 4:47 PM - Rithvik Edoofa: Exclusive Invite to Edoofa's Mega Meet & Greet in Harare! 🌟
2/2/24, 4:47 PM - Rithvik Edoofa: Hi Leeroy,

I'm Mr. Rithvik, HOD of the Department of Student Welfare at Edoofa. Exciting news – you're officially invited to our massive Meet and Greet Event in Harare this February!


As the countdown to your 🇮🇳 India journey ticks away, with just a quarter left (approximately 3 to 4 months! 😄) before you step into this new adventure, I understand that the chaos and preparations might be swirling around you. Let's navigate through this excitement together. Here is an amazing opportunity for you as our Founder & CEO Mr. Angad, along with the admission officers and counselors (whom you have only met virtually until now, exciting right?) are coming to Zimbabwe for an exclusive annual meet & greet!
2/2/24, 4:47 PM - Rithvik Edoofa: With more than 5000 people participating, an event of this magnitude has never happened in Zimbabwe before. This meet & greet is going to be truly unique that Harare has ever seen. We present to you a fantastic opportunity for you to ask questions, address your concerns/queries, fast-track your admission process, and gain clarity about your journey to India. This event is just the beginning of a magical journey, offering you a glimpse into your future brimming with opportunities that would consist of discussions on industrial academia, the scope of your chosen field of study, and following your higher education.
2/2/24, 4:47 PM - Rithvik Edoofa: I would strongly recommend bringing your parents and guardians with you to the event! In your journey of life, they are the most integral part and of course decision-makers in your entire course of education. As you are just one step away from starting your higher education, this event would provide you with an opportunity to witness the path that unfolds for you in the next three to five years here in India - an opportunity for them to actively be a part of your potential journey, gain a deeper understanding towards the entire program and witness the journey of your senior Edoofians!
2/2/24, 4:47 PM - Rithvik Edoofa: Get ready for this adventure, and I'm genuinely happy that you're going to be part of such a phenomenal event! ✨
We'd like to reserve your seats in advance. Could you please let us know how many people you'll be coming with? This will help us allocate the right slots for you.
