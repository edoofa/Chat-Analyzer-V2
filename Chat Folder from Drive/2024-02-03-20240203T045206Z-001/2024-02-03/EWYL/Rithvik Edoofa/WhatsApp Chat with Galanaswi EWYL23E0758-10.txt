27/12/23, 1:23 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Galanaswi,
I hope this message finds you well.

As we approach the end of the year, I am filled with excitement about the upcoming new year. It's a time for optimism, hope, and the opportunity to nurture beautifully curated relationships. However, upon reflection on our journey so far, I recognize a bit of inconsistency and irregularity.

I understand that the holiday season, including Christmas celebrations and New Year enjoyment, may be keeping you occupied. Despite this, I believe it's important for us to consider how we can strengthen our relationship in the EWYL Program. I am eager to hear your thoughts on how we can restart and enhance our collaboration.
28/12/23, 1:06 PM - +27 74 716 3677: Thank you for checking on me

You know when I was a student and till now, I make agendas on what I wish to achieve in life this year, and how I can transform it for the betterment of not just myself, but my family and the people around me.

I, as your wellwisher and companion, wish you that you also push yourself and make the most of the opportunities that are coming your way starting from the EWYL Program that offers you a chance to *stand on your own feet*. Next year, _we will be a few months away from our flight to India_✈️, and I want to see you living a journey till that time that is filled with *hard work and dedication*. I have personally curated this message from the bottom of my heart to wish you a very *Happy New Year, 2024* 🫶🏻

18/1/24, 10:36 AM - +27 62 218 3242: These are guidelines for searching potential companies which can collaborate with EDOOFA. Choosen companies must be student centric, recreational and even be content cebtric platforms.Further more one should check with company financial stability, the background of the founder and the scale of the company.There are platforms which can be used they include Google, LinkedIn and social media pages on Facebook and Twitter etc so as we get proper information with a clear understanding

This is one opportunity I do not wish for you to miss, so do ensure you are online and prepared with your questions on time!!

The time slot has been very carefully decided, keeping in mind the fact that most students are usually available during their lunch breaks or after school.
22/1/24, 9:08 PM - +27 62 218 3242: Greetings
Thank you for letting me know, i will be available.

Yes I'm ready to get started
23/1/24, 3:39 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Great, Galanaswi.
I was actually having a conversation with Ms. Saloni earlier and she walked me through your progress in your EWYL sessions lately. Would you mind walking me through your expectations that you have from the program ahead and how is it that you wish to fulfil them by through the help from the mentorship team?
23/1/24, 3:50 PM - +27 62 218 3242: I'm thankful and happy to have her in my journey.I will grab the opportunity with all my energy so that in the near future it will help me progress through scholarship credits
23/1/24, 4:02 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: That is perfect, Galanaswi, That is exactly what I wanted to talk about.

I wanted to make use of this special one-on-ones that I don't really get to do often. Similarly, the goal that I have for you and all your fellow Edoofians who are a part of the EWYL program is to earn Scholarship Credits.

 May I know your progess in the projects that you have been given?
23/1/24, 4:06 PM - +27 62 218 3242: So far i haven't gotten any potential companies to do my project , it is because of poor networks here in our area. When i get one i will let you know as soon as possible
23/1/24, 4:31 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: That is perfectly fine, Galanaswi. As of now I am only concerned about your regular inputs that you have been making. I hope you understand that the projects are very carefully crafted to not only ensure that you earn credits but to foster marketable skills like leadership, accountability, content creation, etc. 

You must and should approach your projects as practical applications to your learnings. Having said that, there are other projects like community building & African School Reforms, that would help you in the areas of collaboration, public speaking, etc.

I hope that you are on the same page?
23/1/24, 4:34 PM - +27 62 218 3242: Noted i got all you are saying
23/1/24, 4:49 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: That is great, Galanaswi.
 
On the same lines, I had a discussion with your admissions team and was made aware that you are mid way through your journey of coming to India by completing some part of your registration formalities. How are you and your family feeling about that?
23/1/24, 5:29 PM - +27 62 218 3242: My family is aware of everything, we will complete the remaining parts of registration in the next few days
23/1/24, 5:30 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Alright, Galanaswi. I am happy to know that.
A lot of opportunities await you in the program here and also in your journey in India!
23/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Galanaswi, before I end the session for you, I have something interesting to share. Would you like to know that?
23/1/24, 5:32 PM - +27 62 218 3242: Nice to know
23/1/24, 5:32 PM - +27 62 218 3242: Yes i would like to know it
23/1/24, 5:37 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: In recent years, Edoofa has come to be synonymous with events and seminars that are conducted on a grand scale, and has attempted to deepen the impact it leaves on the students who choose to be a part of the same. 

I wanted to personally share with you that in the upcoming weeks, we shall have the most esteemed members of *Team Edoofa visiting various countries all over Africa*, with the sole aim to connect with and inspire students such as yourself, and to guide them on their quest to build meaningful careers and await you on your journey to India. They shall also connect with *visionaries, educationists, industrialists, school headmasters, principals* to share learnings and collaborate in ways that benefit the learners like you! ⭐
23/1/24, 6:03 PM - +27 62 218 3242: Good news
27/1/24, 7:47 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day!
I hope you're doing well.

I know from the past few days, that I could not respond but allow me to share a story very close to my heart🫰🏻

I became a part of Edoofa almost two years back with initial thoughts on how my relationship would be, will I be a good mentor, or will I be able to think like my students, and so on. With these thoughts, I began my journey. Honestly speaking, I learned a lot each day, and yes, made some mistakes but I did not know that now there is going something that I will cherish for my lifetime, our bond. In this journey so far, I have guided more than 500 students, and beyond guidance I have made sure that I can create a transformation in their lives🌟
27/1/24, 7:47 PM - Saloni Edoofa: As an individual, I always believe that the learning process is life never ends and the more you learn, the better the guidance becomes, with a heavy heart, *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor🥺*
*You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

*I want to assure you that the Mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
All the best🫶🏻

2/2/24, 4:46 PM - Rithvik Edoofa: Exclusive Invite to Edoofa's Mega Meet & Greet in Harare! 🌟
2/2/24, 4:47 PM - Rithvik Edoofa: Hi Galanaswi,

I'm Mr. Rithvik, HOD of the Department of Student Welfare at Edoofa. Exciting news – you're officially invited to our massive Meet and Greet Event in Harare this February!


As the countdown to your 🇮🇳 India journey ticks away, with just a quarter left (approximately 3 to 4 months! 😄) before you step into this new adventure, I understand that the chaos and preparations might be swirling around you. Let's navigate through this excitement together. Here is an amazing opportunity for you as our Founder & CEO Mr. Angad, along with the admission officers and counselors (whom you have only met virtually until now, exciting right?) are coming to Zimbabwe for an exclusive annual meet & greet!
2/2/24, 4:47 PM - Rithvik Edoofa: With more than 5000 people participating, an event of this magnitude has never happened in Zimbabwe before. This meet & greet is going to be truly unique that Harare has ever seen. We present to you a fantastic opportunity for you to ask questions, address your concerns/queries, fast-track your admission process, and gain clarity about your journey to India. This event is just the beginning of a magical journey, offering you a glimpse into your future brimming with opportunities that would consist of discussions on industrial academia, the scope of your chosen field of study, and following your higher education.
2/2/24, 4:47 PM - Rithvik Edoofa: I would strongly recommend bringing your parents and guardians with you to the event! In your journey of life, they are the most integral part and of course decision-makers in your entire course of education. As you are just one step away from starting your higher education, this event would provide you with an opportunity to witness the path that unfolds for you in the next three to five years here in India - an opportunity for them to actively be a part of your potential journey, gain a deeper understanding towards the entire program and witness the journey of your senior Edoofians!
2/2/24, 4:47 PM - Rithvik Edoofa: Get ready for this adventure, and I'm genuinely happy that you're going to be part of such a phenomenal event! ✨
We'd like to reserve your seats in advance. Could you please let us know how many people you'll be coming with? This will help us allocate the right slots for you.
