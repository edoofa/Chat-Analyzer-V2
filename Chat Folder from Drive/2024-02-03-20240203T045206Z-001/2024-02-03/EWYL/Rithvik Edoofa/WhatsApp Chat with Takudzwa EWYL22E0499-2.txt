I hope you are doing well

As we embark on today's session, let me share a motivational thought: *'Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.' - Winston Churchill.* This quote reminds us that every step, be it a triumph or a stumble, is part of our journey.

Now, tell me, how did you celebrate Christmas? I believe celebrations are not just about the festive season but also moments of personal victories and joy. How are you doing, and is there anything you'd like to share about your experiences during the holiday season? Let's explore the path ahead together.
26/12/23, 3:02 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Now that the scheduled session time is over, we are wrapping up our session today. I am not happy to see your absence. Kindly specify the reason behind your absense.
26/12/23, 3:02 PM - Sharda Edoofa: So we will resume our session tomorrow onwards from *1:30 PM to 2:30 PM* and your sessions will be held from *Monday to Friday*. 
No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.
As now you are an Edoofian, being punctual should be an inherent trait and I hope that as the clock strikes 8:30, you come for the sessions for your fruitful EWYL Journey.

27/1/24, 8:05 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *Greetings of the day, Tafadzwa*
I hope this message finds you in good spirits. I want to share some heartfelt news with you. After careful consideration, I've come to a decision that carries a mix of emotions. *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor.*

As we journey through this moment, I can't help but feel a mix of emotions realizing that our daily interactions are about to change. *Saying goodbye to our current way of connecting brings a bittersweet feeling*, but deep down, I see change as a chance for growth and the discovery of new opportunities.

Reflecting on our shared journey, I am truly humbled by the extraordinary moments we've experienced together—the bonds we've forged, the shared laughter, and the countless instances of mutual growth and learning.

2/2/24, 4:33 PM - Rithvik Edoofa: Exclusive Invite to Edoofa's Mega Meet & Greet in Harare! 🌟
2/2/24, 4:35 PM - Rithvik Edoofa: Hi Takudzwa,

I'm Mr. Rithvik, HOD of the Department of Student Welfare at Edoofa. Exciting news – you're officially invited to our massive Meet and Greet Event in Harare this February!


As the countdown to your 🇮🇳 India journey ticks away, with just a quarter left (approximately 3 to 4 months! 😄) before you step into this new adventure, I understand that the chaos and preparations might be swirling around you. Let's navigate through this excitement together. Here is an amazing opportunity for you as our Founder & CEO Mr. Angad, along with the admission officers and counselors (whom you have only met virtually until now, exciting right?) are coming to Zimbabwe for an exclusive annual meet & greet!
2/2/24, 4:35 PM - Rithvik Edoofa: I would strongly recommend bringing your parents and guardians with you to the event! In your journey of life, they are the most integral part and of course decision-makers in your entire course of education. As you are just one step away from starting your higher education, this event would provide you with an opportunity to witness the path that unfolds for you in the next three to five years here in India - an opportunity for them to actively be a part of your potential journey, gain a deeper understanding towards the entire program and witness the journey of your senior Edoofians!
2/2/24, 4:35 PM - Rithvik Edoofa: Get ready for this adventure, and I'm genuinely happy that you're going to be part of such a phenomenal event! ✨
We'd like to reserve your seats in advance. Could you please let us know how many people you'll be coming with? This will help us allocate the right slots for you.
