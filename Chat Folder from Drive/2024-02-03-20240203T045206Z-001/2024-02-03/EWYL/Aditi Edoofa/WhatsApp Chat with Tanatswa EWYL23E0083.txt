2/2/24, 2:25 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Tanatswa!

I understand that circumstances led you to delay your higher education journey as of last year, after taking a significant step towards building your future through us and I am sure that you must have been in touch with our Admissions team to figure out the best available solutions for you. Since then, Edoofa has been on a journey of innovation, creating new opportunities for learning and growth for students like you!

While I was going through your conversation, It reminded me of how I started my education journey full of questions and aspirations, and therefore I wanted to check in and have a conversation about how you are doing currently. 
May I know how are you planning to move your journey ahead?🚀

I am doing quite well, I hope you are well yourself
2/2/24, 6:44 PM - +263 78 902 9727: As my parents and I have stressed before, I have chosen to take a gap year asi figure out what I want to do in terms of higher education.
