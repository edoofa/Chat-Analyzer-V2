22/1/24, 1:39 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Are you ready for the session?🚀
22/1/24, 1:41 PM - +27 65 730 0423: Yes mam
22/1/24, 1:42 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
22/1/24, 1:44 PM - +27 65 730 0423: The first person who joined on Saturday is my dad Tawanda Dewa, he's an electrical engineer. And he has been supporting me with this journey alongside with my mum. The person that joined today is Daisy Zulu my mum.
22/1/24, 1:44 PM - +27 65 730 0423: No problem mam
22/1/24, 1:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: That's wonderful to hear! It's fantastic to have your parents supporting you on this journey. Having a strong support system can make a significant difference in pursuing your goals.
22/1/24, 1:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
22/1/24, 1:53 PM - +27 65 730 0423: My long term goals have to be getting a degree for my course. And pursuing my career further , as I also believe that I can help change the economy and society. MY goal has to be giving back to the community and achieving not only wealth but trust from one's community. Helping improve the standard of living and the quality has to be a important goal , and also getting to know people's issues helps me make a change in our world. The EWYL program is a program that helps reduce financial burden on parents, helping them not only save, but also invest in my future more than required. This program will help me as a student to feel  as ease and secure as I know that I will be helping my parents. Also as a sister I will know that my parents can use some of the money to support my siblings who are still in school. And they will not worry about my fees ,giving us a peace of mind . The program will also help me learn about new skills and improve my abilities as a student with no experience in the working world . It will make me more flexible and adapt easier to different jobs.
22/1/24, 1:57 PM - Aditi Edoofa: It's inspiring to hear about your long-term goals and your commitment to making a positive impact on both the economy and society. Pursuing your degree and furthering your career with the aim of contributing to the community is a noble endeavor. Your goal of giving back and improving the standard of living reflects a strong sense of social responsibility.

It's also great to see your appreciation for the EWYL program and how it aligns with your aspirations. The program's support in reducing financial burdens on parents and providing you with opportunities to learn new skills is valuable. This holistic approach not only benefits you as an individual but also extends support to your family, fostering a sense of security and peace of mind. <This message was edited>
22/1/24, 1:59 PM - +27 65 730 0423: Yes mam
22/1/24, 1:59 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
22/1/24, 2:00 PM - +27 65 730 0423: Yes mam
22/1/24, 2:01 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, can you elaborate on your understanding. <This message was edited>
22/1/24, 2:10 PM - +27 65 730 0423: My understanding may not be quite the answer. 


But based on my understanding throughout the entire journey is that the key objectives has to be making it easier for the Edoofians as they learn. Letting them understand that you will support them throughout the journey. The other one has be letting students adapt new skills as they join the program. Teaching them new skills such as management and communication by giving them a task to complete. That's my understanding so far mam
22/1/24, 2:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
22/1/24, 2:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
22/1/24, 2:12 PM - +27 65 730 0423: And also removing the financial burden as you understand that nor everyone has access to the money. So by supporting their goals EWYL creates a opportunity to reduce the costs.
22/1/24, 2:12 PM - +27 65 730 0423: Yes mam
22/1/24, 2:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Indeed!
22/1/24, 2:13 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
22/1/24, 2:13 PM - +27 65 730 0423: Noted mam
22/1/24, 2:14 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
22/1/24, 2:15 PM - +27 65 730 0423: Yes mam
22/1/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.
22/1/24, 2:16 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 2:16 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 2:30 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So we are wrapping up for today and look forward to connecting tomorrow with the same enthusiasm.🌺

22/1/24, 2:31 PM - +27 65 730 0423: I have read the newsletters mam
22/1/24, 2:35 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great, we will discuss it tomorrow.
23/1/24, 1:33 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon on this beautiful day!✨
Hope you are well.

Let's begin with today's discussion🚀
23/1/24, 1:35 PM - +27 65 730 0423: Good day, mam I am well and yourself 

Yes mam
23/1/24, 1:47 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am well. Thanks for asking.
23/1/24, 1:47 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
23/1/24, 1:47 PM - +27 65 730 0423: Yes mam
23/1/24, 1:49 PM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
23/1/24, 1:49 PM - +27 65 730 0423: Great mam
23/1/24, 1:51 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
23/1/24, 1:51 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube

4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is.
23/1/24, 2:02 PM - +27 65 730 0423: 1. In my EWYL team I have the head of department Ms.Sanjama and also Ms. Davi the head coach 
2.My mentor has set three goals for me in summary , ensuring a great academic journey, followed by ensuring enough opportunities to self-finance in India and also working together to ensure I attain skills.
3.A
4.It is where students share their self growth of character and skills.They get a chance to explain their failures and how they overcame them, and it also explains the skills obtained while they were going through that such as management and communication. Showing us that failure does not mean you should give up, instead prepare for your crisis.
23/1/24, 2:07 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Awesome!
23/1/24, 2:08 PM - Aditi Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
23/1/24, 2:08 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 2:09 PM - +27 65 730 0423: Yes mam
23/1/24, 2:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, that’s wonderful. I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
23/1/24, 2:25 PM - +27 65 730 0423: Mam should I share my understanding of the activities too
23/1/24, 2:26 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, you may.
23/1/24, 2:31 PM - +27 65 730 0423: My understanding is that Edoofa has two things they want to achieve which is Awareness of how jobs will look in future ,and also acquiring skills required by jobs in the working world. Some skills needed are awareness of the changing world,  such as how people are using technology to make life easier and better. The acquiring of skills which helps learn more about teamwork and develop one's character. Skills that are emerging such as technology how to improve it and use to connect with more people in the digital world. These are not all the skills but the other just summarize how businesses can be creative and use the new OIL. Bur also there are old skills that are needed in a business, such as decision making and networking with other businesses. To prepare for the future.
23/1/24, 2:33 PM - Aditi Edoofa: This is Fantastic!
23/1/24, 2:33 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!

While the first activity is researching each company which use mobile payments. And the second is identifying the decision makers in a the company and reach out to them. The third one is sharing the Edoofa message with the company , while the fourth is arranging a meeting and contract signing. And the 5th is reporting the progress on the Google sheet that's created.

24/1/24, 1:41 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Wow! This is fantastic!!

24/1/24, 1:41 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 1:56 PM - +27 65 730 0423: The document above tells me about what to look at ,when searching for companies that will found Edoofas vision. The nature of the company plays a vital role in how the company will contribute to Edoofa. And if the company is student centric. Also blogs and newspapers can be used to give Edoofa the right exposure needed to help children better their lives. The size of company that may offer employment to Edoofa students matters , as it will assure that Edoofians are in safe hands when it comes to employment. There are various companies to use such as Google and LinkedIn to help with the process.
24/1/24, 2:03 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –

24/1/24, 2:43 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Yes!
25/1/24, 1:27 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon!✨
Hope you are doing well.

So let's begin with our session🚀
25/1/24, 1:30 PM - +27 65 730 0423: Good day ,
yes mam I am well and yourself
25/1/24, 1:31 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am well. Thanks for asking.
25/1/24, 1:32 PM - +27 65 730 0423: We can begin mam
25/1/24, 1:44 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!
25/1/24, 1:45 PM - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
25/1/24, 1:48 PM - +27 65 730 0423: Noted mam
25/1/24, 1:58 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
25/1/24, 1:58 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Mitchelle/ADITI*
25/1/24, 1:58 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
25/1/24, 1:58 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
25/1/24, 1:58 PM - Aditi Edoofa: ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
25/1/24, 2:02 PM - +27 65 730 0423: When does this need to be done mam

25/1/24, 2:09 PM - +27 65 730 0423: Noted mam
25/1/24, 2:11 PM - +27 65 730 0423: This message was deleted
25/1/24, 2:16 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
25/1/24, 2:16 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

29/1/24, 2:29 PM - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

Let's navigate through this excitement together. Here is an amazing opportunity for you as *our Founder & CEO Mr. Angad, along with the admission officers and counselors (whom you have only met virtually until now) are coming to Zimbabwe for an exclusive annual meet & greet! Sounds amazing, right?* 🤩

With more than 5000 people participating, this meet & greet is going to be truly unique that Harare has ever seen. We present to you a fantastic opportunity for you to ask questions, address your concerns/queries, fast-track your admission process, and gain clarity about your journey to India.🇮🇳

As you're on the verge of starting your higher education, this event allows them to actively participate, understand the program, and witness the experiences of your senior Edoofians.

Prepare for this adventure! I'm genuinely thrilled that you'll be part of this phenomenal event!✨
