Trust you are in good health.

I am waiting for you on the EWYL Line. Adhere to the ritual of saying Proud Edoofian daily on the EWYL line to initiate your session. Integrate this practice into your daily schedule. 🕛
6/1/24, 1:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello @263776174100 

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of *our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs*, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝 <This message was edited>
6/1/24, 1:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
11/1/24, 4:22 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hellooooo!!!!

I quickly just wanted to share the scoop on *Slice Con'24—it was seriously awesome!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️

Hope you are well

Follow the PROUD EDOOFIAN ritual on the EWYL line to begin your session. Make sure to incorporate it into your daily routine.🕛
22/1/24, 4:30 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *_🌟 URGENT UPDATE 🌟_*

Kirsten, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it's going to be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes proper time and effort, our team will be occupied so tight. Therefore, I was thinking of connecting only once a week for the time being.

Therefore, your new session timing will be *Every Tuesday, 9:30 a.m*. ⏰

Can't wait for this adventure together! 🚀
23/1/24, 9:43 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning on this beautiful day!✨
Hope you are well.

Let's begin with today's discussion🚀
23/1/24, 11:06 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The session time is over, may I know why didn't you show up for the session?
24/1/24, 5:28 PM - +263 77 312 2747: Good morning. I'm Kirsten's father. Yeah, it's a lot difficult to share with you the new development that has taken place with my daughter Kirsten in the past month or so, which will most likely make you unhappy. Kirsten attended an  apprenticeship interview in electrical engineering and passed it and has since decided to abandon her plan to come to India for her scholarship in banking and finance. She therefore will be starting her apprenticeship training here in Zimbabwe any day this coming February 2024. It was really a hard and painful decision for all of us to make considering the time and resources that had been directed towards Kirsten's preparations to come to India. That is the position so far regarding her. As a family we are really sorry that all the time that the Edoofa academic board had put in processing our daughter's scholarship offer has yielded nothing, to say the least. We await the Edoofa Academic Board's response in this matter. Thank you.
25/1/24, 9:43 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good day @263773122747 
Hope you are well sir.

I appreciate you providing an update on Kirsten's decision. I understand that these situations can be challenging, and I appreciate your honesty. But I would like you to connect with the Admissions team on this as I am sure they must have something great for her, also it's a decision regarding her future so I would recommend that you take time and evaluate your decision.
2/2/24, 2:27 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Kirsten!

I understand that circumstances led you to delay your higher education journey as of last year, after taking a significant step towards building your future through us and I am sure that you must have been in touch with our Admissions team to figure out the best available solutions for you. Since then, Edoofa has been on a journey of innovation, creating new opportunities for learning and growth for students like you!

While I was going through your conversation, It reminded me of how I started my education journey full of questions and aspirations, and therefore I wanted to check in and have a conversation about how you are doing currently. 
May I know how are you planning to move your journey ahead?🚀
