I quickly just wanted to share the scoop on *Slice Con'24—it was seriously awesome!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️

Let's navigate through this excitement together. Here is an amazing opportunity for you as *our Founder & CEO Mr. Angad, along with the admission officers and counselors (whom you have only met virtually until now) are coming to Zimbabwe for an exclusive annual meet & greet! Sounds amazing, right?* 🤩

With more than 5000 people participating, this meet & greet is going to be truly unique that Harare has ever seen. We present to you a fantastic opportunity for you to ask questions, address your concerns/queries, fast-track your admission process, and gain clarity about your journey to India.🇮🇳
