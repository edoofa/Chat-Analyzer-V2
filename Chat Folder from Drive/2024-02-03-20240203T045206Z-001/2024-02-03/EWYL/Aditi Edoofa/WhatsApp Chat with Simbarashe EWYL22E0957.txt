*Great news – there's a reserved spot just for you in the registration process!* 
We understand that sometimes deadlines can be challenging to meet. Missing the registration fee deadline might seem like a roadblock, however, it isn't yet! Your dedication matters the most to us.

I am sure that your admissions officers must have already taken the first steps, and as a mentor, it is my advice to you to have transparency in your conversations so that we can help you fulfill your goal of arriving in India for your higher education! ✅
There’s a catch! You now have a chance to fast-track your admissions process and meet your officers too! 😀

*Join our unique event in Harare with 5000+ participants for a meet & greet, Q&A, and fast-track admission to your journey to India.* Bring your parents for a deeper understanding of the program. Secure your seats by confirming the number of attendees. Excited to have you! ✨
