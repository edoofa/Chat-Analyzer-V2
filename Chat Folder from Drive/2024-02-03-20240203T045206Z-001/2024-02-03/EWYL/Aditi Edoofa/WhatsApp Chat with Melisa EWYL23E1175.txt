25/1/24, 8:53 AM - +263 77 170 1656: Yes let's begin
25/1/24, 8:56 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I am well. Thanks for asking,
25/1/24, 8:56 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
25/1/24, 8:57 AM - +263 77 170 1656: @263772939466  that's my father
@263783770688 that's my mother
25/1/24, 9:05 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I extend a warm welcome to them for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey
25/1/24, 9:05 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
25/1/24, 9:12 AM - +263 77 170 1656: My long term goals include having a degree in business management and becoming one of the well known managers in my continent or world wide .
25/1/24, 9:18 AM - +263 77 170 1656: I think the EWYL program will help me  financially to pay my tuition Fee since my parents may find it difficult
25/1/24, 9:23 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your long-term goals! It's impressive that you aspire to have a degree in business management and become a well-known manager. The financial support provided by the EWYL program will indeed be valuable in helping you achieve these ambitions.
25/1/24, 9:23 AM - +263 77 170 1656: Thank you
25/1/24, 9:27 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
25/1/24, 9:28 AM - +263 77 170 1656: No l don't
Can you you give me a brief about the objectives
25/1/24, 9:29 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
25/1/24, 9:29 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
25/1/24, 9:32 AM - +263 77 170 1656: Okay I understand
Thank you
25/1/24, 9:34 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Wrapping up the session I must say it's been a wonderful interaction. I can't wait for our next one.
25/1/24, 9:36 AM - +263 77 170 1656: Thank you
I also can't wait for the next one I'm excited
25/1/24, 1:25 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I wanted to inform you that tomorrow i.e. 26th January marks Indian Republic Day🇮🇳, a significant occasion celebrating the adoption of our nation's constitution. In observance of this special day, our institution will be closed tomorrow, and there will be no official activities.
Let's reconvene and continue our discussions on Monday🚀
25/1/24, 1:25 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 5:48 PM - +263 77 170 1656: Okay
Have a blessed holiday
29/1/24, 8:28 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Embrace the new week with enthusiasm. Your attitude determines your direction, and your positive mindset can turn challenges into opportunities. Make this Monday a stepping stone to success!☀️

So are you ready for the session?🚀
29/1/24, 8:38 AM - +263 77 170 1656: @919625219934 
Good morning
29/1/24, 8:38 AM - +263 77 170 1656: Yes l am ready
29/1/24, 8:39 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
29/1/24, 8:39 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
29/1/24, 8:39 AM - +263 77 170 1656: Sorry for the late reply my network was down
29/1/24, 8:41 AM - +263 77 170 1656: Okay thank you
Nice to meet you Ms.Sanjana and Ms.Davi
29/1/24, 8:45 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
29/1/24, 8:45 AM - +263 77 170 1656: Yes it does
29/1/24, 8:49 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

29/1/24, 9:08 AM - +263 77 170 1656: Yes it is

It can also be a virtual showcase that shows municipalities  economic development agencies and property owners*
30/1/24, 9:19 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Melisa, I didn't want an answer that you copied from a website, so if you must have gone through the newsletter, you must have seen a section which we call as Hall of Inspiration.
30/1/24, 9:30 AM - +263 77 170 1656: It is when a real life situation inspired someone to be matured in life
30/1/24, 9:35 AM - Aditi Edoofa: It is the experiences of your fellow Edoofians who made a great impact in their course of work as Edoofians over the past years. And who had the privilege to be on the newsletter mentioned by Mr. Angad Singh.

These skills include *online/ digital skills and literacy*, *social media literacy* , *remote team work*  just to mention a few_And about project 1_
Firstly *primary outcome* . Edoofians will represent edoofa to build a network of partner companies and potential employers . This will help the edoofians create a strong professional network and earn schoolarship credits
Additionally *skillsets*  *covered*  . This is about network skills, using professional networking websites like Linkedin and building confidence just to mention a few. 
Moreover *mindset* *covered* it all about reaching out to the people who are influential , facing rejections, fail , try, fail and try again, people who never give up
