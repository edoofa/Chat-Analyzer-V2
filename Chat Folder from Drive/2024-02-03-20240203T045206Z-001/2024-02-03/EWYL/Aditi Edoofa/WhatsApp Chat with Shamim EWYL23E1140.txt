24/1/24, 1:55 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: My long term goal are to further my studies in the cardiac science and to later be able to open a hospital
24/1/24, 1:56 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: And I believe the EWYL program will create a smooth learning experience for me allowing me to fulfil my dreams
24/1/24, 2:03 PM - +265 999 87 50 19: Good afternoon,
I am Muhammed Kayisi Sadala, father to Shamim.

I am glad to follow through the process my daughter is understanding at the moment. Thank you.
24/1/24, 2:21 PM - Aditi Edoofa: That's an admirable goal! Pursuing further studies in cardiac science and aspiring to open a hospital reflects a commitment to making a significant impact in the field of healthcare. Your dedication to contributing to the well-being of others is commendable. As we work together, we'll focus on the steps and skills needed to achieve these long-term objectives.
24/1/24, 2:22 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good afternoon Mr. Muhammed Kayisi Sadala,

It's a pleasure to connect with you, and I appreciate your involvement in the progress of your daughter, Shamim.Looking forward to supporting Shamim on her educational journey!
24/1/24, 2:25 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: We definitely will
24/1/24, 2:26 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
24/1/24, 2:27 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
24/1/24, 2:35 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: No ma'am
24/1/24, 2:39 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
24/1/24, 2:39 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
24/1/24, 2:40 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: Very well understood
24/1/24, 2:41 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So we are wrapping up today's session. Have a great day ahead!✨
24/1/24, 3:14 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: A good day to you too
25/1/24, 1:27 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon!✨
Hope you are doing well.

So let's begin with our session🚀
25/1/24, 1:39 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: Good afternoon ma'am
25/1/24, 1:57 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
25/1/24, 1:58 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: Thank you for the introduction
25/1/24, 2:04 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
25/1/24, 2:07 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: Very interesting
25/1/24, 2:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

In observance of this special day, our institution will be closed tomorrow, and there will be no official activities.
Let's reconvene and continue our discussions on Monday🚀
