Thank you for asking
23/1/24, 2:04 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Praise, it seems like you recently completed your initial orientation sessions with Ms. Saloni. Would you mind sharing your experience with me? Did you get a chance to also discuss the opportunities that await you in the EWYL program with your parents?
23/1/24, 2:06 PM - +263 71 980 7849: Yes we did
23/1/24, 2:13 PM - +263 71 980 7849: I had a wonderful experience with Ms Saloni. She is a great mentor. She taught me how to connect with different people in various communities. She taught me the soft skills to use when communicating with school heads or Principals in the African Schools Project. She was always there to help when I faced challenges. Not for forgetting the Wednesday Wisdom and Saturday activities , she explained them to me and helped to mould the person I am today
23/1/24, 2:21 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Well, this is wonderful and reassuring, Praise. I wanted to make use of this opportunity to check in and understand to see if you are ready for all that we have planned for you in the EWYL program ahead - not only to ensure that you gain enough industrial exposure but also to earn scholarship credits.

I hope that you are ready to consistently give your 100% moving forward?
23/1/24, 2:22 PM - +263 71 980 7849: I am ready
23/1/24, 2:36 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: That is great, Praise!
Praise, I was having a conversation with Ms. Saloni earlier and she walked me through your progress in your EWYL sessions lately. Would you mind walking me through your expectations that you have from the program ahead and how is it that you wish to fulfil them by through the help from the mentorship team?
23/1/24, 2:45 PM - +263 71 980 7849: My expectations are gaining new skills, expanding my network and  finding new opportunities.
23/1/24, 2:54 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: That sounds great, Praise. I hope you understand that this would only be possible if you show up to working on your aspirations every single day and also to making your contributions towards your EWYL program regularly. Contributions can be of any scale - big or small. However, they should always result into learnings. You can obtain those learning from your sessions with your mentor, projects, wednesday lessons, etc. I hope that you make the most of it.
23/1/24, 2:58 PM - +263 71 980 7849: I will
23/1/24, 3:27 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: In recent years, Edoofa has come to be synonymous with events and seminars that are conducted on a grand scale, and has attempted to deepen the impact it leaves on the students who choose to be a part of the same. 

I wanted to personally share with you that in the upcoming weeks, we shall have the most esteemed members of Team Edoofa visiting various countries all over Africa, with the sole aim to connect with and inspire students such as yourself, and to guide them on their quest to build meaningful careers and await you on your journey to India.

23/1/24, 5:44 PM - +263 71 980 7849: Same to you
27/1/24, 8:12 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day!
I hope you're doing well.

I know from the past few days, that I could not respond but allow me to share a story very close to my heart🫰🏻

I became a part of Edoofa almost two years back with initial thoughts on how my relationship would be, will I be a good mentor, or will I be able to think like my students, and so on. With these thoughts, I began my journey. Honestly speaking, I learned a lot each day, and yes, made some mistakes but I did not know that now there is going something that I will cherish for my lifetime, our bond. In this journey so far, I have guided more than 500 students, and beyond guidance I have made sure that I can create a transformation in their lives🌟
27/1/24, 8:12 PM - Saloni Edoofa: As an individual, I always believe that the learning process is life never ends and the more you learn, the better the guidance becomes, with a heavy heart, *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor🥺*
*You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

*I want to assure you that the Mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
All the best🫶🏻
27/1/24, 8:41 PM - +263 71 980 7849: Aaww🥹 thank you for being the best mentor and friend 🫶🏾
