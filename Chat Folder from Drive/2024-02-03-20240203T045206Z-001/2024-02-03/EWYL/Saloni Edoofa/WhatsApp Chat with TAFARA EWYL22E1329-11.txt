29/12/23, 10:53 AM - Saloni Edoofa: This is amazing Tafara, you have got the idea of it and it reflects from your explaination🫱🏻‍🫲🏼

27/1/24, 8:40 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day!
I hope you're doing well.

I know from the past few days, that I could not respond but allow me to share a story very close to my heart🫰🏻

I became a part of Edoofa almost two years back with initial thoughts on how my relationship would be, will I be a good mentor, or will I be able to think like my students, and so on. With these thoughts, I began my journey. Honestly speaking, I learned a lot each day, and yes, made some mistakes but I did not know that now there is going something that I will cherish for my lifetime, our bond. In this journey so far, I have guided more than 500 students, and beyond guidance I have made sure that I can create a transformation in their lives🌟
27/1/24, 8:40 PM - Saloni Edoofa: As an individual, I always believe that the learning process is life never ends and the more you learn, the better the guidance becomes, with a heavy heart, *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor🥺*
*You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

*I want to assure you that the Mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
All the best🫶🏻
27/1/24, 10:17 PM - +263 78 108 1765: I am doing well Ms Saloni. My day was good and I hope you are doing well too. Oh what sad news !  Sure ma'am, us as students we loved you a lot. You were so good to us. It's so sad that you have chosen to left your Edoofa Mentorship ! We learned a lot from you and we hope that you will keep on bequeathing others with the same knowledge you gave us. You have our support and love as students ! Now that you have chosen a different path, We wish you success in your new endeavors. We pray and hope that you will excel in your pursuit of higher education. I hope that the fate of life shall bring you and your students together once again. All the best to you too, ma'am. Till we meet again by the Lord's grace, Bye 👋🏻
