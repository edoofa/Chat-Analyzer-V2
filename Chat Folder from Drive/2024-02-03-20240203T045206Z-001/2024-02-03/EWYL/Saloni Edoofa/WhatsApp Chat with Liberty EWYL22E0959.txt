29/12/23, 4:34 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day,

You know when I was a student and till now, I make agendas on what I wish to achieve in life this year, and how I can transform it for the betterment of not just myself, but my family and the people around me. Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.
I, as your wellwisher and companion, wish you that you also push yourself and make the most of the opportunities that are coming your way starting from the EWYL Program that offers you a chance to *stand on your own feet*. Next year, _we will be a few months away from our flight to India_✈️, and I want to see you living a journey till that time that is filled with *hard work and dedication*. I have personally curated this message from the bottom of my heart to wish you a very *Happy New Year, 2024* 🫶🏻

Sorry for the communication break down going on between my side and yours
[2023/12/18, 12:32] +91 80023 12433: Good afternoon,

Can you share the reason for the same?
[2023/12/19, 16:37] Problem Child: Uhm my father lost employment just recently and for his responsibility have been much increased as to look after for my little brother  now im located in the rurals and my network was and is very weak therefore resulting in the loss of better communication with you 

Currently im not sure if  im going to make it as he was my main financial supporter for the programme
[2023/12/20, 13:22] +91 80023 12433: Good afternoon Liberty,

How is everything going on now?
[2023/12/23, 13:30] Problem Child: Not so well maam, busy with farming, my near future still bleak my parents financially challenged
[2023/12/23, 13:33] Problem Child: I guess I should have discussed with you in detail what isent on the group but was worried about my network as well as data that i may fail to get in touch with you in time
[2023/12/26, 07:59] +91 80023 12433: Good morning Liberty,
How are you?
[2023/12/26, 08:00] +91 80023 12433: Please share the same on the EWYL Group, we will be continuing our discussion there.
[2023/12/26, 12:26] Problem Child: Im okay thank you 

How are you
[2023/12/26, 12:26] Problem Child: Okay mama
27/1/24, 7:53 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day!
I hope you're doing well.

I know from the past few days, that I could not respond but allow me to share a story very close to my heart🫰🏻

I became a part of Edoofa almost two years back with initial thoughts on how my relationship would be, will I be a good mentor, or will I be able to think like my students, and so on. With these thoughts, I began my journey. Honestly speaking, I learned a lot each day, and yes, made some mistakes but I did not know that now there is going something that I will cherish for my lifetime, our bond. In this journey so far, I have guided more than 500 students, and beyond guidance I have made sure that I can create a transformation in their lives🌟
27/1/24, 7:53 PM - Saloni Edoofa: As an individual, I always believe that the learning process is life never ends and the more you learn, the better the guidance becomes, with a heavy heart, *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor🥺*
*You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

*I want to assure you that the Mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
All the best🫶🏻
