27/12/23, 1:20 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Benvolence,
I hope this message finds you well.

As we approach the end of the year, I am filled with excitement about the upcoming new year. It's a time for optimism, hope, and the opportunity to nurture beautifully curated relationships. However, upon reflection on our journey so far, I recognize a bit of inconsistency and irregularity.

I understand that the holiday season, including Christmas celebrations and New Year enjoyment, may be keeping you occupied. Despite this, I believe it's important for us to consider how we can strengthen our relationship in the EWYL Program. I am eager to hear your thoughts on how we can restart and enhance our collaboration.
27/12/23, 1:27 PM - +263 71 621 0247: Thank you madam
27/12/23, 1:29 PM - +263 71 680 2311: Yes we can restart
27/12/23, 1:30 PM - +263 71 621 0247: Iam a proud Edofian
27/12/23, 1:34 PM - Saloni Edoofa: May I know the reason of inactiveness lately?
27/12/23, 1:50 PM - +263 71 680 2311: They haven't been responding on the EYWL line
28/12/23, 8:42 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Benvolence and parents,
How are you?
28/12/23, 8:42 AM - Saloni Edoofa: For quite a long time I see that you are quite irregular in session, in terms of not responding to the lessons and activities with me. Benvolence, the entire aim of my work, and asking my students to delicately work on projects is to see them earn and financially help them to stand on their feet. But with you most of the time any of these were lacking. May I know if you wish to know about the projects in depth again, particularly the community building project and the African school reform project?
28/12/23, 11:24 AM - +263 71 680 2311: Yes l wish so
28/12/23, 11:24 AM - +263 71 680 2311: Sometimes people using the EYWL line do not respond
29/12/23, 8:28 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Benvolence,
How are you?
29/12/23, 8:29 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Do not worry, I will make sure to respond to all your concerns as a priority.

But do you promise me to me regular and consistent in your sessions?
29/12/23, 9:02 AM - +263 71 680 2311: Yes l promise
29/12/23, 1:16 PM - Saloni Edoofa: That is amazing then we will have our sessions on Tuesday and Friday from 12:00-01:30 PM.
29/12/23, 4:25 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day,

You know when I was a student and till now, I make agendas on what I wish to achieve in life this year, and how I can transform it for the betterment of not just myself, but my family and the people around me. Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.
I, as your wellwisher and companion, wish you that you also push yourself and make the most of the opportunities that are coming your way starting from the EWYL Program that offers you a chance to *stand on your own feet*. Next year, _we will be a few months away from our flight to India_✈️, and I want to see you living a journey till that time that is filled with *hard work and dedication*. I have personally curated this message from the bottom of my heart to wish you a very *Happy New Year, 2024* 🫶🏻

27/1/24, 7:29 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day!
I hope you're doing well.

I know from the past few days, that I could not respond but allow me to share a story very close to my heart🫰🏻

I became a part of Edoofa almost two years back with initial thoughts on how my relationship would be, will I be a good mentor, or will I be able to think like my students, and so on. With these thoughts, I began my journey. Honestly speaking, I learned a lot each day, and yes, made some mistakes but I did not know that now there is going something that I will cherish for my lifetime, our bond. In this journey so far, I have guided more than 500 students, and beyond guidance I have made sure that I can create a transformation in their lives🌟
27/1/24, 7:29 PM - Saloni Edoofa: As an individual, I always believe that the learning process is life never ends and the more you learn, the better the guidance becomes, with a heavy heart, *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor🥺*
*You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

*I want to assure you that the Mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
All the best🫶🏻
27/1/24, 8:54 PM - +263 71 680 2311: Oh okay

27/1/24, 8:56 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Thank you so much, and will all my heart, I want to wish you all the best🙌🏼
