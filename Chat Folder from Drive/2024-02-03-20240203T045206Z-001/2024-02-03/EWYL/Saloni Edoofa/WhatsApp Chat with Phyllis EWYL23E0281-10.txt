Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.
I, as your wellwisher and companion, wish you that you also push yourself and make the most of the opportunities that are coming your way starting from the EWYL Program that offers you a chance to *stand on your own feet*. Next year, _we will be a few months away from our flight to India_✈️, and I want to see you living a journey till that time that is filled with *hard work and dedication*.

I sincerely apologize for the delay in responding to your updates. Edoofa organized a grand flagship event from Monday to Wednesday named *SLICE Con'24 (Symposium of Leaders, Inventors, and Creators with Edoofa*)🫱🏻‍🫲🏼 where our Indian Edoofians, representing partner universities,  immersed in a grand event _featuring CEOs and Marketing heads of multi-millionaire brands_📈, braced themselves for networking opportunities, internships, and more. The event was really grand, let me show you a short glimpse of one of the days.

Is there any update yet
27/1/24, 8:10 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day!
I hope you're doing well.

I know from the past few days, that I could not respond but allow me to share a story very close to my heart🫰🏻

I became a part of Edoofa almost two years back with initial thoughts on how my relationship would be, will I be a good mentor, or will I be able to think like my students, and so on. With these thoughts, I began my journey. Honestly speaking, I learned a lot each day, and yes, made some mistakes but I did not know that now there is going something that I will cherish for my lifetime, our bond. In this journey so far, I have guided more than 500 students, and beyond guidance I have made sure that I can create a transformation in their lives🌟
27/1/24, 8:10 PM - Saloni Edoofa: As an individual, I always believe that the learning process is life never ends and the more you learn, the better the guidance becomes, with a heavy heart, *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor🥺*
*You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

*I want to assure you that the Mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
All the best🫶🏻
28/1/24, 1:38 AM - +263 77 525 5853: I feel the loss

This time it is bigger and better! Our Founder & CEO, Mr. Angad along with our team, admission officers, and counselors whom all of you have met behind the screens— are up to share priceless insights that will shape your next four years in India.

This event offers them a chance to understand the program and witness the journeys of past students, providing valuable insights for your higher education journey in India. So, get ready for this epic adventure, and I'll share the details with you super soon!*

2/2/24, 4:01 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good Afternoon Phyllis,
This is *an exclusive invite to our annual Meet and Greet Event* which is happening in Zimbabwe this month where we invite all our students and their guardians to give the students a glimpse of how their lives are going to change once they reach India. 

There would be seminars as well which would revolve around career building and counseling by experts in the field. You will also get an opportunity to have a Q&A session with our expert counselors in individual sessions to learn more about the opportunities available in the next 5 years, the scope of your field of study and also employment. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for you since this event would be the first of its kind in Zimbabwe, and we are expecting around 5000 participants across all provinces of Zimbabwe! I am sure there would be a lot of takeaways that would be useful for you for the rest of your academic as well as professional life.
2/2/24, 4:45 PM - +263 77 525 5853: Do you mind sharing where exactly in Zimbabwe is this function going to take place 
We need to make preparations on bus fares and accommodation if it's to be held far from my place.
2/2/24, 4:46 PM - +263 77 525 5853: If you can also give the actual date or an assumption on prescribed dates so that we my parents clear their tables for such an important meeting
