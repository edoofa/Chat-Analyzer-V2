You know when I was a student and till now, I make agendas on what I wish to achieve in life this year, and how I can transform it for the betterment of not just myself, but my family and the people around me. Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.
I, as your wellwisher and companion, wish you that you also push yourself and make the most of the opportunities that are coming your way starting from the EWYL Program that offers you a chance to *stand on your own feet*. Next year, _we will be a few months away from our flight to India_✈️, and I want to see you living a journey till that time that is filled with *hard work and dedication*. I have personally curated this message from the bottom of my heart to wish you a very *Happy New Year, 2024* 🫶🏻

How are you?

I sincerely apologize for the delay in responding to your updates. Edoofa organized a grand flagship event from Monday to Wednesday named *SLICE Con'24 (Symposium of Leaders, Inventors, and Creators with Edoofa*)🫱🏻‍🫲🏼 where our Indian Edoofians, representing partner universities,  immersed in a grand event _featuring CEOs and Marketing heads of multi-millionaire brands_📈, braced themselves for networking opportunities, internships, and more. The event was really grand, let me show you a short glimpse of one of the days.

23/1/24, 10:06 AM - +263 77 669 4287: Hello
Good morning ma'am
27/1/24, 8:44 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day!
I hope you're doing well.

I know from the past few days, that I could not respond but allow me to share a story very close to my heart🫰🏻

I became a part of Edoofa almost two years back with initial thoughts on how my relationship would be, will I be a good mentor, or will I be able to think like my students, and so on. With these thoughts, I began my journey. Honestly speaking, I learned a lot each day, and yes, made some mistakes but I did not know that now there is going something that I will cherish for my lifetime, our bond. In this journey so far, I have guided more than 500 students, and beyond guidance I have made sure that I can create a transformation in their lives🌟
27/1/24, 8:44 PM - Saloni Edoofa: As an individual, I always believe that the learning process is life never ends and the more you learn, the better the guidance becomes, with a heavy heart, *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor🥺*
*You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

*I want to assure you that the Mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
All the best🫶🏻
27/1/24, 9:02 PM - +263 77 669 4287: Ma'am l am going to miss you so much
It was really a  great opportunity to meet you and    talk to you though am not going to get the chance actually meet you  lively. I am thankful that you have been an very understanding mentor with much patience and love. Thank you for the blessings of my continued success Ms Saloni 🫶🏽I will never forget you ma'am 💜
Stay blessed
27/1/24, 9:11 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Your message has left me profoundly touched and emotional. To say you've been my best student is an understatement; your attention to detail, active participation, and remarkable growth have enriched our journey beyond measure. Your kind words are some of the most heartwarming parting messages a mentor could receive. I genuinely love you, and I'm immensely grateful for the privilege of being a part of your journey🥺🙌🏼🫶🏻
27/1/24, 9:23 PM - +263 77 669 4287: Thank you so much🥹🫶🏽
I am hoping that you have a better and brighter future ahead ma'am
29/1/24, 2:26 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Good Afternoon Tinotenda,

Congratulations on this well-deserved opportunity!🥳

This is no ordinary event; _we are expecting a gathering of 5000 people_, and we believe in your ability to not just meet but exceed the responsibilities that come with this role. ⭐

This role is not mandatory but rather an invitation for you to explore and consider. As one of the Event Coordinators, it's a chance for you to showcase your *leadership skills, problem-solving abilities, and creativity* on a grand scale. Apart from this, you will also have the golden opportunity to *collaborate with Edoofa’s Team, work closely with Mr. Angad Singh,* and contribute significantly to the success of this huge event! 🎯
I know you must be feeling butterflies in your stomach, along with a lot of questions in your mind. Well, to clear all your doubts regarding this opportunity we have scheduled *a video call with all the students who have been given this opportunity tomorrow* and the timings for the same will be also shared tomorrow itself. If you have any questions or if there's anything you'd like to discuss, please note it down so that it can be addressed over the call.🚨
