How was your Christmas celebration🎄?

29/12/23, 4:27 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day,

You know when I was a student and till now, I make agendas on what I wish to achieve in life this year, and how I can transform it for the betterment of not just myself, but my family and the people around me. Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.
I, as your wellwisher and companion, wish you that you also push yourself and make the most of the opportunities that are coming your way starting from the EWYL Program that offers you a chance to *stand on your own feet*. Next year, _we will be a few months away from our flight to India_✈️, and I want to see you living a journey till that time that is filled with *hard work and dedication*. I have personally curated this message from the bottom of my heart to wish you a very *Happy New Year, 2024* 🫶🏻

I am thrilled to share with you that a very special opportunity awaits you tomorrow. I have managed to schedule a special one on one session with the *Program Head Ms Sanjana.* The session would be held from *1:30 pm to 3:00 pm CAT*. This is one opportunity I do not wish for you to miss, so do ensure you are online and prepared with your questions on time!!

The time slot has been very carefully decided, keeping in mind the fact that most students are usually available during their lunch breaks or after school. <This message was edited>

How are you doing today?
23/1/24, 2:49 PM - +263 78 648 1446: I am well  and how are you
24/1/24, 11:15 AM - +263 71 243 1513: Morning, do we have another schedule for this  session?
27/1/24, 8:08 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day!
I hope you're doing well.

I know from the past few days, that I could not respond but allow me to share a story very close to my heart🫰🏻

I became a part of Edoofa almost two years back with initial thoughts on how my relationship would be, will I be a good mentor, or will I be able to think like my students, and so on. With these thoughts, I began my journey. Honestly speaking, I learned a lot each day, and yes, made some mistakes but I did not know that now there is going something that I will cherish for my lifetime, our bond. In this journey so far, I have guided more than 500 students, and beyond guidance I have made sure that I can create a transformation in their lives🌟
27/1/24, 8:08 PM - Saloni Edoofa: As an individual, I always believe that the learning process is life never ends and the more you learn, the better the guidance becomes, with a heavy heart, *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor🥺*
*You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

*I want to assure you that the Mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
All the best🫶🏻
28/1/24, 8:24 AM - +263 78 648 1446: It was nice knowing you and what a wonderful journey i had with you. I  wish you all the best on your  new journey !❤️❤️
28/1/24, 2:38 PM - +263 71 243 1513: Wish you the best, may God fullfil your dreams.
