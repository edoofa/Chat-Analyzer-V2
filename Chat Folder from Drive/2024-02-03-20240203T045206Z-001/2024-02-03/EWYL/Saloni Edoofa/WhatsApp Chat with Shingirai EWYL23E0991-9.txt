25/12/23, 5:15 PM - Saloni Edoofa added you
29/12/23, 9:20 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Shingirai and parents, I hope you are doing well. 
I am *Ms. Saloni* and I will be your *EWYL mentor* now.

How are you?
29/12/23, 9:26 AM - Saloni Edoofa: I believe the EWYL Program for Shingirai was supposed to begin on 15th December 2023 but through this time I was waiting for the message from your end which I believe must have been told to you by the Admission Team to share for me to kickstart with the Program. But I had an in-depth discussion with the Admission Team regarding your admission process and indeed I understood that you might be occupied in that so I thought to provide you with the right space to think and make the right decision. I hope if you are ready, we can begin with our session.
29/12/23, 9:41 AM - +263 77 864 0240: Greetings ma'am

29/12/23, 9:42 AM - Saloni Edoofa: To fasten up our progress and to give you _my undivided attention_, I want to have our sessions at some scheduled time so that in that time slot I can pay all my notice and we can very soon move ahead.
I hope you don't have any problem with it.

Your session is from *01:30 - 02:30 PM* - Monday to Friday

Please let me know as soon as possible so that we can resume our sessions.

Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.
I, as your wellwisher and companion, wish you that you also push yourself and make the most of the opportunities that are coming your way starting from the EWYL Program that offers you a chance to *stand on your own feet*. Next year, _we will be a few months away from our flight to India_✈️, and I want to see you living a journey till that time that is filled with *hard work and dedication*.

Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.

The event was really grand, let me show you a short glimpse of one of the days.

27/1/24, 8:37 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day!
I hope you're doing well.

I know from the past few days, that I could not respond but allow me to share a story very close to my heart🫰🏻

I became a part of Edoofa almost two years back with initial thoughts on how my relationship would be, will I be a good mentor, or will I be able to think like my students, and so on. With these thoughts, I began my journey. Honestly speaking, I learned a lot each day, and yes, made some mistakes but I did not know that now there is going something that I will cherish for my lifetime, our bond. In this journey so far, I have guided more than 500 students, and beyond guidance I have made sure that I can create a transformation in their lives🌟
27/1/24, 8:37 PM - Saloni Edoofa: As an individual, I always believe that the learning process is life never ends and the more you learn, the better the guidance becomes, with a heavy heart, *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor🥺*
*You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

*I want to assure you that the Mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
All the best🫶🏻
2/2/24, 11:15 AM - Saloni Edoofa: *Hello, Shingirai, this is an official announcement from Team Edoofa!*

There’s a catch! You now have a chance to fast-track your admissions process and meet your officers too! 😀
