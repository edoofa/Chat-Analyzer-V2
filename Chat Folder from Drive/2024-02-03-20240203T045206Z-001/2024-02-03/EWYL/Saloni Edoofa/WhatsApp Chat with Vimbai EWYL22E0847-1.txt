28/12/23, 8:13 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Vimbai,
I hope this message finds you well.

As we approach the end of the year, I am filled with excitement about the upcoming new year. It's a time for optimism, hope, and the opportunity to nurture beautifully curated relationships. However, upon reflection on our journey so far, I recognize a bit of inconsistency and irregularity.

I understand that the holiday season, including Christmas celebrations and New Year enjoyment, may be keeping you occupied. Despite this, I believe it's important for us to consider how we can strengthen our relationship in the EWYL Program. I am eager to hear your thoughts on how we can restart and enhance our collaboration.
28/12/23, 11:43 AM - +263 77 463 5723: Im sorry Ms Saloni I will try showing more seriousness on my work
29/12/23, 8:31 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Vimbai,
How are you?

Well, I am confident that you will try your best to be consistent but may I know the reason behind your absence in your last sessions?
29/12/23, 1:42 PM - +263 77 463 5723: Hello Ms Saloni
I had problems with my gadget but its fixed now
29/12/23, 3:13 PM - Saloni Edoofa: You know when I was a student and till now, I make agendas on what I wish to achieve in life this year, and how I can transform it for the betterment of not just myself, but my family and the people around me. Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.
I, as your wellwisher and companion, wish you that you also push yourself and make the most of the opportunities that are coming your way starting from the EWYL Program that offers you a chance to *stand on your own feet*. Next year, _we will be a few months away from our flight to India_✈️, and I want to see you living a journey till that time that is filled with *hard work and dedication*. I have personally curated this message from the bottom of my heart to wish you a very *Happy New Year, 2024* 🫶🏻

27/1/24, 9:16 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day!
I hope you're doing well.

I know from the past few days, that I could not respond but allow me to share a story very close to my heart🫰🏻

I became a part of Edoofa almost two years back with initial thoughts on how my relationship would be, will I be a good mentor, or will I be able to think like my students, and so on. With these thoughts, I began my journey. Honestly speaking, I learned a lot each day, and yes, made some mistakes but I did not know that now there is going something that I will cherish for my lifetime, our bond. In this journey so far, I have guided more than 500 students, and beyond guidance I have made sure that I can create a transformation in their lives🌟
27/1/24, 9:16 PM - Saloni Edoofa: As an individual, I always believe that the learning process is life never ends and the more you learn, the better the guidance becomes, with a heavy heart, *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor🥺*
*You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

*I want to assure you that the Mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
All the best🫶🏻

1/2/24, 7:09 PM - +263 77 463 5723: Good evening Ms Saloni
Thank you for letting me know about this event. I would like to let you know that I will be attending it with both of my parents. Kindly reserve three seats including mine, thank you.
2/2/24, 4:15 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good Afternoon Vimbai,
Really glad to see your excitement and we will definitely reserve 3 seats for you. 

Also, wanted to share that as Ms. Saloni is no longer connected and we as a team do not want you to miss out on this huge opportunity so this message has been shared from the Edoofa Academic Board.
2/2/24, 4:18 PM - +263 77 463 5723: Okay sure thank you. May I have more information on the dates and venue for this event please?
