29/12/23, 9:50 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Hello, our proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. 
First off, I just want to wish you a massive congratulations on getting into the Edoofa scholarship program and a very warm welcome to the Earn While You Learn Program.
My name is SALONI. I would like to share that I will be your mentor for the Earn While You Learn Program, and together we will be undertaking this learning experience. Getting an opportunity to study abroad on a scholarship and to work on your skill set to be employment-ready, is something that any ambitious child would dream of. I hope that in a couple of years/ you’ll be able to agree with me that these are the best years of your life.


I believe good mentors are passionate about helping and developing their mentees and receive their rewards not in the form of money or other payback, but in seeing the people they have helped grow and become successful. As your mentor, my role will be to use my experience and knowledge to give you advice, support, and answer any questions you may have, and ensure/ that you are growing and developing with each discussion we have.
29/12/23, 9:50 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Let me introduce myself: My name is Saloni and I have a lot of interest in Economics. I like to relate global and social eye-openers to our daily lives and how they can impact us. Furthermore, my interest is drawn toward painting and dancing. I enjoy interacting with young minds, and it brings me great satisfaction to see how diligent and focused young students are about their goals in life, whether personal or professional. I like kids who are curious to learn and are excited to add different skills to their knowledge each day. I believe that a student can achieve any goal through discipline and commitment. If you have the target set in your mind, no one can stop you from living your dreams and attaining greater heights. I wish you all the very best for this journey and I believe that together we can reach up the ladder and climb higher summits.
29/12/23, 12:54 PM - +267 74 197 595: Waal thank you

Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.
I, as your wellwisher and companion, wish you that you also push yourself and make the most of the opportunities that are coming your way starting from the EWYL Program that offers you a chance to *stand on your own feet*. Next year, _we will be a few months away from our flight to India_✈️, and I want to see you living a journey till that time that is filled with *hard work and dedication*.

Please excuse me for the delay in responding, the entire team as been involved in a three-day glorious event.
I quickly just wanted to share the scoop on *Slice Con'24—it was seriously awesome!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️

18/1/24, 2:28 PM - +267 74 238 400: I have understood the following 
The EWYL program is there to help Edoofians to adjust well into the digital world, this is through introductions to big giants in the digital world and instilling good marketable skills so that as you emerge from the Edoofa program you  are employable . Most of my interest has been invested in the issue of scholarship credits , for me this is the best attribute to the EWYL program ,experiencing how much my mother has been struggling to see me through my academic life it would be very wonderful for me to also have a hand in my education financially , I have also learnt all the three projects and lm positive l can partake well in all of them due to my computer literacy and passion on the digital world

I hope you're doing well.

I know from the past few days, that I could not respond but allow me to share a story very close to my heart🫰🏻

I became a part of Edoofa almost two years back with initial thoughts on how my relationship would be, will I be a good mentor, or will I be able to think like my students, and so on. With these thoughts, I began my journey. Honestly speaking, I learned a lot each day, and yes, made some mistakes but I did not know that now there is going something that I will cherish for my lifetime, our bond. In this journey so far, I have guided more than 500 students, and beyond guidance I have made sure that I can create a transformation in their lives🌟
27/1/24, 8:10 PM - Saloni Edoofa: As an individual, I always believe that the learning process is life never ends and the more you learn, the better the guidance becomes, with a heavy heart, *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor🥺*
*You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

*I want to assure you that the Mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
All the best🫶🏻
