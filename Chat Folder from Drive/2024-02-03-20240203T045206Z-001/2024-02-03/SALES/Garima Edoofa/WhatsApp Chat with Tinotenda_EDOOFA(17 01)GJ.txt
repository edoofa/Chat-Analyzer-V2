23/01/24, 9:24 am - Garima Edoofa: Greetings @263712671111 @263772667454 , Hope you are doing well.
23/01/24, 9:24 am - Garima Edoofa: Alright, please I will do so.
23/01/24, 10:36 am - +263 71 267 1111: Noted with thanks
23/01/24, 11:27 am - Garima Edoofa: Well  as you mentioned that it is your desire to study medicine, but it is very unfortunate that we don't offer medicine as a course because of the following reasons:


1. Affordability: Medicine is one of the most expensive courses everywhere in the world, as it requires high-class facilities and great doctors and mentors to teach that.
 
2. Eligibility: India is a great place to study for higher education as it has both qualities of education and affordability, but for medicine in India, you need to give an entrance exam named NEET, which is very competitive and only 1000 students are selected from millions each year.
 
3. Length of the program: Medicine is a 6-8 years course including the internships(attachment) that are mandatory, so it also contributes to the affordability issue.
 
But I realize that you want to do a course that makes your parents proud and also align with your passion. So you can go ahead with the courses in Medical Field such as
 
1. Bachelor of Science in Nursing
2. Bachelor in  Pharmacy
3. Bachelor in Physiotherapy
4. Bachelor of Science in Medical Lab Technology 
 
These courses have a lesser duration than Medicine and are more affordable for students.
23/01/24, 11:37 am - +263 71 267 1111: Noted. She needs pharmacy
23/01/24, 12:19 pm - Garima Edoofa: Well,
With your interest in the Pharmacy field, may I know why you didn't opt for Physics for A level?
23/01/24, 12:27 pm - +263 71 267 1111: She had B in physics so  they did not give her the combination with physics
23/01/24, 4:20 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright! So going through your results which you've shared, I would recommend *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry or B.Sc. Chemistry*
23/01/24, 4:21 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, May I know if this course aligns with you?
23/01/24, 4:59 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response in the counselling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counselling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT.*

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *9:00 am to 4:30 pm on Monday to Friday, and from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm* on Saturday so to complete your application you would have to be present during the time.
