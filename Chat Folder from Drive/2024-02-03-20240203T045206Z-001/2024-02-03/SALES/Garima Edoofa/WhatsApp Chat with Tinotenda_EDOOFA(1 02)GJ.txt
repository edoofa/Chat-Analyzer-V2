01/02/24, 5:32 pm - Garima Edoofa: It is a pleasure to connect with you today, 

You can address me as Ms. Garima and we do have with us, Mr. Sahil who is the Senior Career Counselor and Mr. Jyotishman who is the Head of Admissions and will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
01/02/24, 6:42 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation*
02/02/24, 9:12 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263772345845 , Hope you are doing well.

I am here to continue our session, shall we start?
02/02/24, 5:53 pm - Garima Edoofa: Hi, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I will be waiting for your response.
