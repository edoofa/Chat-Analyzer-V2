24/01/24, 3:37 pm - Garima Edoofa: Good Afternoon, I hope this finds you well,

I am Ms. Garima, Career Counselor at Edoofa.

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program for Veron

I hope I have contacted the right person?
24/01/24, 5:40 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response in the counselling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counselling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT.*

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *9:00 am to 4:30 pm on Monday to Friday, and from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm* on Saturday so to complete your application you would have to be present during the time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
25/01/24, 9:19 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263779767470 @263719407199 , Hope you are doing well.

I am here to begin our session, shall we start?
25/01/24, 7:02 pm - Garima Edoofa: Hi, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

 However, I will not be able to connect with you tomorrow since it is our National holiday tomorrow on the occasion of Republic Day, and  therefore we will be connecting on Monday.

01/02/24, 9:26 am - Garima Edoofa: Good day, @263779767470 @263719407199 ,

I regret the tardiness in my reply. I experienced some personal matters that required my immediate attention, thus delaying my response. Now that I have returned, we can commence our session now.
01/02/24, 6:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: Hi, I hope you are doing well!

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible and employment-oriented higher education program.

I will be waiting for your response.
02/02/24, 9:05 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263779767470 @263719407199 , Hope you are doing well.

I am here to continue our session, shall we start?
02/02/24, 5:57 pm - Garima Edoofa: Hi, I hope you are in good health.

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application. Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further.
