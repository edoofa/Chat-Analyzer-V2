02/02/24, 1:34 pm - +263 78 077 1448: Well I chose law because I feel like there are people who are serving long sentences for crimes they didn't commit mainly because no one is standing up for them to make sure that there isn't a miscarriage of Justice. I want to stand up for those people.
02/02/24, 2:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, May I know anyone in your family who has pursued this course?
02/02/24, 2:23 pm - +263 78 077 1448: I'm actually the first one, no one in my family has ever attempted to study law

02/02/24, 3:55 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
02/02/24, 4:01 pm - +263 78 077 1448: I want to study abroad because I feel like there is more to explore about the program outside Zimbabwe plus by studying outside Zimbabwe my skills will be unique unlike other lawyers who studied in Zim. In addition to that, with the financial difficulties in Zimbabwe I can never find a Scholarship to study in Zim. So studying abroad is advantageous because there are scholarships like Edoofa which are willing to help students study abroad
02/02/24, 4:29 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, me that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
02/02/24, 4:45 pm - +263 78 077 1448: I am going to cross pollinate ideas from abroad to my mother country so that the legislative system can be more advanced
02/02/24, 5:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hardwork for your community Jabulani, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
02/02/24, 5:54 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response in the counselling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counselling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT.*
