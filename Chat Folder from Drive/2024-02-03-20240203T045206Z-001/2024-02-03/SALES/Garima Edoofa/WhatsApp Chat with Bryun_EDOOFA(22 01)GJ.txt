I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
24/01/24, 8:55 am - +263 71 544 5511: I don't know about my mom and sister there will be working
24/01/24, 10:06 am - +27 61 820 6236: Good morning how are you
24/01/24, 10:07 am - +27 61 820 6236: On the pdf that you sent there are some issues that are not clear
24/01/24, 10:08 am - +27 61 820 6236: I wanted to understand if you still fund people if they want to further their education here in Zimbabwe and not India
24/01/24, 10:08 am - +27 61 820 6236: Also the percentage of funding is not stated.it only states that you do not do full funding as inky a few students get them
24/01/24, 10:11 am - Garima Edoofa: Can you please elaborate on this? what exactly you mean by this, please?
24/01/24, 10:14 am - +263 71 544 5511: Isn't edoofa for India studies only
24/01/24, 10:34 am - Garima Edoofa: May I know why do you want your child to study in Zimbabwe.
24/01/24, 10:54 am - +27 61 626 6440: For security reasons.since they are so many cases of children being abused
24/01/24, 11:02 am - +27 61 820 6236: Okay, sorry I just assumed it's a funding for any country one wants to study at
24/01/24, 12:45 pm - Garima Edoofa: I'd like to address your statement about India being an attractive destination for students from 128 countries. If there were concerns about child abuse, it seems unlikely that such a significant number of students would choose to study there. Our organization, with a 14-year history of working in Africa and assisting over 6000 families, has observed that students are content, and their families express satisfaction. This positive feedback contributes to the decision of many students to pursue tertiary education in India. Additionally, it's crucial to note that India maintains a zero-tolerance policy towards such activities, and those found guilty face legal consequences, including imprisonment.

If you wish, I can facilitate connections with students currently studying in India, allowing you to directly inquire about their experiences and the treatment they receive.

02/02/24, 2:17 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
02/02/24, 2:18 pm - +263 71 544 5511: Well it's because first of all the program is not taught in Zimbabwe
02/02/24, 2:19 pm - +263 71 544 5511: Because India does have space stations it would be great working with people who have experience in this field
02/02/24, 2:20 pm - +263 71 544 5511: And also the Zimbabwean school fees rise very day with no notices
02/02/24, 2:22 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
02/02/24, 2:26 pm - +263 71 544 5511: Well first i would like the program to be taught in my country so people would have degrees on it
To start a space station which creates rockets , satellites so we can explore the great universe
02/02/24, 2:28 pm - +263 71 544 5511: Well basically it's all about developing, education and employing my country
02/02/24, 2:29 pm - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hardwork for your community Bryun, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
02/02/24, 2:30 pm - +263 71 544 5511: Yes that's very true
02/02/24, 2:31 pm - Garima Edoofa: As you are aware, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
02/02/24, 2:32 pm - +263 71 544 5511: Yeah i would love to know

02/02/24, 2:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know if you understood everything properly?
02/02/24, 2:38 pm - +263 71 544 5511: Wow India is a great country really
02/02/24, 2:39 pm - +263 71 544 5511: Truly it's a technology hub
02/02/24, 3:27 pm - Garima Edoofa: It is indeed.
02/02/24, 3:28 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay well Bryun, since you have understood all the reasons properly as well, can you now tell me:-

1)How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career?

2)How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
02/02/24, 3:45 pm - +263 71 544 5511: 1) well since I'm learning in a country with both theory and practical experience i think i would have a better understanding in india and exploring new people and new culture
02/02/24, 3:47 pm - +263 71 544 5511: 2) Studying in India would be a great way to broaden my horizons and gain new perspectives on the world. India is a diverse and dynamic country with a rich culture and history, and I think it would be fascinating to experience this firsthand. I would also be able to learn from some of the best minds in the world, as India is home to many prestigious universities. And finally, I think that the experience of living and studying in India would make me a more well-rounded and cultured individual, which would be beneficial for my future career.
02/02/24, 3:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is remarkable, Bryun. I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students are capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
02/02/24, 3:50 pm - +263 71 544 5511: Yes but money is a problem to everyone so we do consider that
02/02/24, 3:52 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.

Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
02/02/24, 3:52 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 3:53 pm - Garima Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who can qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year, but as some courses are niche in nature like *Aerospace Engineering* itself is a course which has fewer scholarships seats, which is why for you the Annual fee after the scholarship would be between *$2700-$3700*. This cost includes:
	1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
	2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
	3. Food
	4. Accommodation
02/02/24, 3:54 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, don't you think it is affordable for your family?
02/02/24, 3:55 pm - +263 71 544 5511: So you mean after scholarships it's 2700
02/02/24, 3:55 pm - +263 71 544 5511: If we can afford you can hear from my mother
02/02/24, 3:57 pm - +263 71 544 5511: I did understand
02/02/24, 3:57 pm - +263 71 544 5511: So is there like a payment plan
02/02/24, 4:09 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know what do you exactly mean by the payment plan?
02/02/24, 4:10 pm - +263 71 544 5511: Do qe pay it all at once or we can pay per semester or monthly
02/02/24, 4:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: @263715445511 I would like to tell you since I mentioned above that Aerospace Engineering is a niche course so hence it will cost $2700-$3700, moreover in a niche course like Aerospace Engineering there are a limited number of seats, which is why Annual fee after the scholarship would be between *$2700-$3700*.
02/02/24, 4:24 pm - Garima Edoofa: @263715445511 I would advise you to exercise patience, as the information provided pertains solely to the annual fee range. Following the eligibility check interview with the Program Director, and upon successful completion thereof, our admissions team will guide you through the payment plan details.
02/02/24, 4:50 pm - +263 71 544 5511: Thank you truly
02/02/24, 4:50 pm - +263 71 544 5511: I think now my mother as a say on the fees part
02/02/24, 5:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: In simple words Bryun what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3700 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food, and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
02/02/24, 5:59 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response in the counselling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counselling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT.*

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *9:00 am to 4:30 pm on Monday to Friday, and from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm* on Saturday so to complete your application you would have to be present during the time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
