15/01/24, 12:11 pm - Garima Edoofa: I understand the clarification you're seeking. Let me provide some additional context:

Accounting can be approached in different ways within the context of education. In many countries, including the India, and others, accounting is often offered as a specialization or major within a broader undergraduate program, such as a Bachelor of Commerce (B.Com) or a Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA).

When students pursue a B.Com or a similar business-related degree, they typically have the option to specialize in accounting.
15/01/24, 1:34 pm - +263 71 921 3646: So Accounting is not offered as an individual program!?
15/01/24, 1:43 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes, exactly, B.Com or a similar business-related degree, they typically have the option to specialize in accounting.
15/01/24, 2:22 pm - +263 71 921 3646: Uhm but why don't you offer Accounting as a separate program
15/01/24, 2:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: As I have informed you in the above message, Accounting is a specialization, and with the help of a bachelor in commerce degree you can further have a specialization in  Accounting.
15/01/24, 3:34 pm - +263 71 921 3646: Ohh If you say so I guess it's perfect that way
15/01/24, 3:44 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood the course properly.

Can you now tell me, if you are provided with this career option, how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course?
And if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
15/01/24, 5:14 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for tomorrow at 9 AM CAT as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation*

So are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?
16/01/24, 2:12 pm - +263 71 921 3646: I would be willing to give my 400% to my future as I want to build a successful future for myself n family
16/01/24, 2:25 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
16/01/24, 2:31 pm - +263 71 921 3646: Uhmm I jus like the idea of studying abroad as I see it having many chances of finding jobs abroad too
16/01/24, 3:10 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
16/01/24, 6:28 pm - +263 71 921 3646: Uhmm I'm seeking to help some schools with stationery...and maybe help others too realise their dreams
16/01/24, 7:10 pm - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hard work for your community Takura, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
16/01/24, 7:45 pm - +263 71 921 3646: Yepp I totally agree with you
16/01/24, 8:03 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you on *tomorrow again at 9:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

Have a good night
God Bless You!
16/01/24, 8:04 pm - +263 71 921 3646: Sure Goodnight

17/01/24, 12:56 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
17/01/24, 1:17 pm - Garima Edoofa: Are we still connected?
17/01/24, 2:49 pm - +263 71 921 3646: Uhmm yesss

17/01/24, 2:53 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know if you understood everything properly?
17/01/24, 2:56 pm - +263 71 921 3646: Yah I think I do understand all
17/01/24, 3:05 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay well Takura, since you have understood all the reasons properly as well, can you now tell me:-

1)How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career?

2)How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
17/01/24, 4:28 pm - +263 71 921 3646: Uhmm since it offers one of the best opportunities in academic life I would be sure to attain good results that help me become a better person n boost my intelligence too
17/01/24, 4:29 pm - +263 71 921 3646: Uhmm by studying in India I want to work hard n achieve all goals to be successful in life
17/01/24, 4:41 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is remarkable, Takura. I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing the education, the student is capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
17/01/24, 4:43 pm - +263 71 921 3646: Uhmm no I'm not aware of any
17/01/24, 4:43 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.

Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
17/01/24, 4:44 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 4:45 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, Don't you think it is affordable for your family?
17/01/24, 4:49 pm - +263 71 921 3646: Uhmm after the scholarship!?
17/01/24, 4:50 pm - Garima Edoofa: In simple words Takura what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
17/01/24, 4:51 pm - Garima Edoofa: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.

What are your thoughts on the same?
17/01/24, 4:57 pm - +263 71 921 3646: Yah I would love to cut those costs to $0
17/01/24, 8:18 pm - Garima Edoofa: I really appreciate that, it totally depends on your hard work.
17/01/24, 8:19 pm - Garima Edoofa: Shall I brief you about The Earn While You Learn Program?
17/01/24, 8:20 pm - +263 71 921 3646: Im determined!!💯
17/01/24, 8:20 pm - +263 71 921 3646: Yepp I would love that
17/01/24, 8:23 pm - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
17/01/24, 8:23 pm - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.


1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
17/01/24, 8:23 pm - Garima Edoofa: 2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
17/01/24, 8:24 pm - Garima Edoofa: 3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
17/01/24, 8:24 pm - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
17/01/24, 8:24 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 8:57 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response in the counselling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counselling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT.*

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *9:00 am to 4:30 pm on Monday to Friday, and from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm* on Saturday so to complete your application you would have to be present during the time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
19/01/24, 9:19 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263719213646 @263772213796 , Hope you are doing well.
19/01/24, 9:19 am - Garima Edoofa: Excuse me for the delay in my response, As I was facing some urgent health challenges.

I am here to continue with our discussion, shall we start?
19/01/24, 11:03 am - +263 71 921 3646: It's okay hope you well now
19/01/24, 11:12 am - Garima Edoofa: Yes, I doing well now, thank you for asking.
19/01/24, 11:13 am - Garima Edoofa: Could you please answer this question?
19/01/24, 11:14 am - +263 71 921 3646: Yah definitely I think it will benefit me in the same way or even better
19/01/24, 11:14 am - +263 71 921 3646: Thank God!!🙏🏼🙏🏼
19/01/24, 11:14 am - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
19/01/24, 11:15 am - Garima Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

19/01/24, 11:19 am - +263 71 921 3646: Yahh I see a great difference from the others and I think I have found what I have been searching for
19/01/24, 11:56 am - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

1.*Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.*Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.*Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.*Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
19/01/24, 11:56 am - Garima Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
19/01/24, 12:03 pm - +263 71 921 3646: Uhmm obviously the earn while you learn program is one of a kind
19/01/24, 12:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you have been looking for the same.


Alright Takura, basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
19/01/24, 12:05 pm - +263 71 921 3646: Yah I guess so
19/01/24, 12:06 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright Takura, basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
19/01/24, 12:07 pm - +263 71 921 3646: Ok sure
19/01/24, 12:09 pm - Garima Edoofa: Takura as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
19/01/24, 12:11 pm - +263 71 921 3646: Uhmm around $1500-$2250
19/01/24, 12:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
19/01/24, 12:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
19/01/24, 12:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 12:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.

Don’t you think so?
19/01/24, 12:17 pm - +263 71 921 3646: Yepp I think so
19/01/24, 12:21 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
19/01/24, 12:22 pm - Garima Edoofa: Takura basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
19/01/24, 12:22 pm - Garima Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
19/01/24, 12:24 pm - +263 71 921 3646: Yah I think this is fair
19/01/24, 12:24 pm - +263 71 921 3646: It's a very good process I suppose
19/01/24, 1:14 pm - Garima Edoofa: Takura, as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspect of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his finances all by himself (in 80 to 100 words)?
19/01/24, 1:18 pm - +263 71 921 3646: Uhmm Edoofa gives a learner a chance to minimise his/her payment of the annual fees through the earn while you learn program whereby the learner receives scholarship credits which the amount varies depending with the effort the learner is putting. This has been a great benefit to most of the learners who cover all their tution fees
19/01/24, 1:19 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you
*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications,SOP,Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions etc all you need to pay is $350
 
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee,Accommodation,Food,Wifi,Laundry,Library,Gym fee etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
19/01/24, 1:20 pm - +263 71 921 3646: That's so attractive and interesting
19/01/24, 1:23 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes Takura and I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
19/01/24, 1:31 pm - +263 71 921 3646: Yah but how do you get so much scholarship credits
19/01/24, 1:41 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would like you to go through this video, please?
19/01/24, 2:55 pm - +263 71 921 3646: Yah I had watched that...that's the guy with the most scholarship credits right
19/01/24, 2:57 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes, indeed. 

More such students are working hard to earn scholarship credits.
19/01/24, 2:57 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

1.*Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee.

Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
19/01/24, 2:57 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
19/01/24, 2:58 pm - +263 71 921 3646: Obviously the earn while you learn program is the best
19/01/24, 3:02 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you have been looking for the same.


Alright Takura, basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
19/01/24, 3:11 pm - Garima Edoofa: Are we still connected?
19/01/24, 3:17 pm - +263 71 921 3646: Yah the parents should be directly involved in this
19/01/24, 3:17 pm - +263 71 921 3646: Sorry had been called
19/01/24, 3:17 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes, correct.
19/01/24, 3:17 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright Takura, basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
19/01/24, 3:18 pm - +263 71 921 3646: But didn't we talk about this earlier
19/01/24, 3:29 pm - Garima Edoofa: Excuse me for that, as I was sending this message to another applicant.
19/01/24, 3:31 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 3:31 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
19/01/24, 3:31 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
19/01/24, 3:31 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
19/01/24, 3:50 pm - +263 71 921 3646: Yepp I think I understood
19/01/24, 3:58 pm - Garima Edoofa: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that 
particular University chosen by you.

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Monday on “22-01-24” at 10:00 AM CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, *Senior Career Counselor Mr Sahil would be getting in touch*, we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible and employment-oriented higher education program.

I will be waiting for your response.
25/01/24, 9:10 am - Garima Edoofa: Greetings @263719213646 @263772213796 , Hope you are doing well.

I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
25/01/24, 9:43 am - +263 71 921 3646: Good morning and sorry about yesterday I had to work out all day
25/01/24, 10:34 am - Garima Edoofa: Can you please answer this question?
25/01/24, 11:07 am - +263 71 921 3646: Ok she will give you the message
25/01/24, 11:36 am - Garima Edoofa: May I know at what time, please?
25/01/24, 12:11 pm - +263 77 221 3796: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 12:21 pm - Garima Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
25/01/24, 12:21 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
25/01/24, 12:21 pm - Garima Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
25/01/24, 12:21 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 12:23 pm - Garima Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 31st  January or  1st February 2024 for $200 and the 28th  or 29th of February  for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 31st January or 1st February 2024. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
25/01/24, 1:59 pm - +263 77 221 3796: I think we are prepared to go with option 1
25/01/24, 2:30 pm - Garima Edoofa: Can please acknowledge the same in the form of a voice note?
25/01/24, 2:38 pm - +263 77 221 3796: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 2:38 pm - Garima Edoofa: @263772213796  since you have answered all the questions, now a video call will be scheduled with the Program Director, once I submit the evaluation report of Takura's application. 

Shall I get you the slots for tomorrow and may I know at what time you are available for the same?

As you may know, each university offers courses with varying durations. In Zimbabwe, it is referred to as *industrial attachment* or *work internships*. India refers to it as *" placements."* Every university affiliated with the Edoofa Program has its own dedicated placement cell. Their primary mission is to ensure that all students secure placements in their pre-final year of education.
02/02/24, 5:44 pm - Garima Edoofa: When students reach their pre-final year, they participate in placement drives conducted by various multinational corporations, startups, and organizations. During these drives, students go through interviews, and if they demonstrate proficiency, they end up receiving job offers from these companies. Depending on the job offer, students have the option to apply for a work permit that allows them to extend their stay in India for the duration of their employment.
02/02/24, 5:44 pm - Garima Edoofa: Moreover, the EWYL program for you is specifically designed so that you as a student are able to learn the 21st-century skills which are certainly required for every student to be employable ready. Through EWYL you will boost your confidence which is going to help you in the future and with the skills learned you will definitely be employable ready. It depends upon the student how much they are willing to learn from the program.
02/02/24, 5:45 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope you are clear now?
