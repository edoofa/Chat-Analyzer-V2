*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.
*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.
02/02/24, 1:11 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would want you to go through the course and understand it and inform me once it is done.
02/02/24, 2:05 pm - +263 78 988 8134: It seems like it's a bit different from the course I want
02/02/24, 2:08 pm - +263 78 988 8134: Because from my understanding when l was reading about the course it seems like l won't be dealing with casea on my own as l wished but rather working alongside other which l see being a disadvantage
02/02/24, 4:08 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know why this course does not align with you since you only mentioned you wished to study Law.
02/02/24, 4:20 pm - +263 78 988 8134: According to how l understood the concept being nallified above abt the Bachelor's of Arts in legislative law if one studies the course the person does not get the full responsibility in ones case but act as an assistant beside the actual lawyer which is not with my passion as my greatest passion is to be the lawyer not an assistant
02/02/24, 5:41 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you on *tomorrow again at 9:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.
