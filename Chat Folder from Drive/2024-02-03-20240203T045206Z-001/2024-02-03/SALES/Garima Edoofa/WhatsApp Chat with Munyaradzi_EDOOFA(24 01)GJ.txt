01/02/24, 9:23 am - Garima Edoofa: Good day, @263716851154 @263783646390 ,

I regret the tardiness in my reply. I experienced some personal matters that required my immediate attention, thus delaying my response. Now that I have returned, we can commence our session now.
01/02/24, 10:54 am - +263 71 685 1154: Yes please
01/02/24, 11:06 am - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate it please.
01/02/24, 11:06 am - Garima Edoofa: Well ,
With your interest in the medical field, may I know why you didn't opt for Biology for A level?
01/02/24, 11:50 am - +263 71 685 1154: Actually I  had a mixed passion , a little in civil engineering also but medicine had the upper hand.I was told physics will work for medicine.
01/02/24, 12:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: I can understand,
Let me tell you ,Biology is a mandatory subject for medical science as it lays the background for medical courses.Therefore I regret to inform you that your combination is not eligible for Medical programs.
But may I know what other career aspirations do you have,please

I do understand ,Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have Physics and Mathematics in their A level mandatorily.
01/02/24, 12:57 pm - +263 71 685 1154: Okay, Ms Garima
BSc Civil Engineering.
