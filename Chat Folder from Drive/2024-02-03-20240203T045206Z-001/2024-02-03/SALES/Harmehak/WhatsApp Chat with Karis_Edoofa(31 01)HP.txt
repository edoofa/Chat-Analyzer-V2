It offers about 50 percent scholarship depending on the programme that one does.lt can also help one to pay fees through part time work This will then enable the student to comfortably pay his/ her fees
01/02/24, 11:21 am - Harmehak: Well received, Karis, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
01/02/24, 11:21 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.

01/02/24, 3:28 pm - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
01/02/24, 7:37 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

02/02/24, 11:26 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Karis, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD St Paul's Musami charged you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
02/02/24, 11:49 am - +263 77 608 8498: Ok l am Karis Taziva Phiri. I did my o level in 2021 and completed my a level in 2023. I specialised with arts subjects at a level and l scored 13 points.St Paul's Musami charged around  380 USD.l wish to study BB L law.

02/02/24, 12:10 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Karis, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!

May I know about your siblings and your father's field of self employment?

02/02/24, 12:45 pm - Harmehak: Well Karis, now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
02/02/24, 12:47 pm - +263 77 608 8498: I do believe Ms Harmehak
02/02/24, 12:59 pm - Harmehak: Very well and would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
02/02/24, 1:28 pm - +263 77 608 8498: I think its a life changing decision because it gives exposure and there can.also be employment opportunities which is far different from this side .l also believe that it will change me for the better
02/02/24, 1:28 pm - +263 77 608 8498: Yes l am prepared for a life abroad
02/02/24, 1:29 pm - Harmehak: You see, Karis, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
02/02/24, 2:31 pm - +263 77 608 8498: Yes you are right things are not moving well
02/02/24, 2:43 pm - Harmehak: Indeed!
02/02/24, 2:43 pm - Harmehak: Karis, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
02/02/24, 2:50 pm - +263 77 608 8498: I am waiting for their final say
02/02/24, 3:02 pm - Harmehak: While I understand,

Didn't you happen to discuss with them earlier as well, Karis?
02/02/24, 8:35 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 10 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
