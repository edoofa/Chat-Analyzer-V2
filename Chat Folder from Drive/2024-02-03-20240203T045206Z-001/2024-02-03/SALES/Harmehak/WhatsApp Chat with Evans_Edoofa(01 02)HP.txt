01/02/24, 9:42 am - +263 71 410 1209: That's how I express my happiness, I'm very happy to hear that.
01/02/24, 9:42 am - Harmehak: I appreciate, Evans!
01/02/24, 9:42 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Evans, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Morgan high school charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
01/02/24, 10:24 am - +263 71 410 1209: Well, firstly I would like to say  I'm highly motivated and academically driven individual, I am eager to pursue a degree in Banking and finance Additing or  IT  but financial constraints have made it challenging for me to afford the expenses associated with tertiary education. I come from Epworth. 

Basing on the issue of Morgan high school, it charges $ 112 and Our AFM church members used to help us on that. 

My strength is *never giving up* Normater what circumstances, positivity, having faith and aslo being a motivational speaker. 

Academically, my strength is on Mathematics 

I was a prefect at Morgan high school so others saw my weaknesses as being a soft leader. 

I live with my brother Justice and he finished his A level in 2021, and my mother is a maid, her highest level of education is ZJC. My father died when I was 5.

In a nutshell, After my academic studies, I want to make a world a better place to live. I want to be helped so that I can help others because that is what I understand how we grow as people 🌝 thank you.
01/02/24, 10:31 am - +263 71 410 1209: I did my A level 
1)mathematics B
2)Economics B
3)And Business Studies C
01/02/24, 10:33 am - Harmehak: I am sorry for your loss, Evans.
01/02/24, 10:35 am - +263 71 410 1209: Nobody can escape death, that is painful 😢 Thank you once again.
01/02/24, 10:38 am - +263 71 410 1209: Please Ms. Harmehak you you still have some questions notify me 🌝and I would aslo like to ask if you give me the chance. 💫
01/02/24, 10:38 am - Harmehak: I understand.
01/02/24, 10:38 am - Harmehak: So Evans now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
01/02/24, 10:43 am - +263 71 410 1209: Yes, I believe it is a great idea since you been interacting with different people with different cultures and experiences so I will be learning a lot and exchanging  ideas.
01/02/24, 11:20 am - Harmehak: Very well and would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too? <This message was edited>
01/02/24, 1:13 pm - +263 71 410 1209: Yes I will be excited to meet new people Ms Harmehak. 😊
01/02/24, 1:18 pm - +263 71 410 1209: And contribute positively to both the university and the world as a whole.
01/02/24, 1:24 pm - Harmehak: Evans, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
01/02/24, 1:34 pm - +263 71 410 1209: It was always my mother's wish and all my family members for me to study abroad and my mother will try her best to make me get high quality education she can afford.
01/02/24, 1:36 pm - Harmehak: I do understand, Evans!

So what is your mother's plan to support you financially?
01/02/24, 1:56 pm - +263 71 410 1209: My mother is always hard working although she gets little money but however on rain days she might get assistance from some of our church members. 


🌱She can also borrow from relatives or friends so as to fulfill the quote from my father ' If you do not come from a rich family,a rich family must come from you'
01/02/24, 2:21 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your mother's efforts and your father's thoughts, Evans.
01/02/24, 2:21 pm - Harmehak: So did you happen to discuss regarding your higher education with church members or family?
01/02/24, 2:53 pm - +263 71 410 1209: Yes, we discussed but fund raising is done occasionally, so they said they will help me after fund raising.
01/02/24, 2:57 pm - +263 71 410 1209: However, this depends on the amount needed. If the amount needed is very high the congregants will not carry all of the burden that is why I am actively looking for  Edoofa's scholarship.
01/02/24, 3:22 pm - Harmehak: I understand Evans!

However do you understand that you would require financial support along with the scholarship?
01/02/24, 4:03 pm - +263 71 410 1209: Yes, I understand, I have a friend of mine who told me about that, But I believe that It is not the giant leaps but often the small steps, that bring about the most lasting change. 

And also we might not have strong financial support but if we can learn how to hang on there, we will be alright.
Thank you for the question Ms Harmehak.
01/02/24, 7:29 pm - Harmehak: I would have loved to continue, however I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
01/02/24, 7:35 pm - +263 71 410 1209: Thank you very much Ms. Harmehak I understood.

May God bless you and have a nice dream.
01/02/24, 7:38 pm - Harmehak: You can have a discussion as a family and go through the following document.
01/02/24, 7:38 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 7:50 pm - +263 71 410 1209: Okay thank you once again Ms. Harmehak
02/02/24, 9:29 am - +263 71 410 1209: Good morning Ms. Harmehak, Mr. Jyotishman and Mr. Piyush, how are you this morning.
02/02/24, 9:32 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
02/02/24, 9:34 am - +263 71 410 1209: I'm good thank you Ms. Harmehak, yes, we can start.
02/02/24, 9:47 am - Harmehak: Were you able to go through the shared document, Evans?
02/02/24, 9:49 am - +263 71 410 1209: Yes
02/02/24, 9:57 am - Harmehak: Well now that you have gone through the document could you please share with me-

1. Your understanding of the Edoofa program?
2. Your understanding of the financial aspect of the program?
02/02/24, 10:25 am - +263 71 410 1209: Firstly, Edoofa is not a philanthropic organization, it's a profit organization which helps deserving students  to change their lives through affordable higher quality education. It also gives internships opportunities and extracurricular activities . More so, it is globally recognized and can provide cost effective and job focused college education in other countries like Canada and USA. 

Last but not least it engages in a program called earn while you learn which helps students to become employable, enhance their communication skills as well as time management. Students maybe in a position to gain some money to tip for the next semester.
02/02/24, 10:41 am - +263 71 410 1209: On the issue of financial aspects, Edoofa provides    on the Tution fee and the quantam of the scholarship depending on one's performance in interview as well as merit and academic background, work experience etc. Edoofa's scholarship also reduces costs from 6000-8000 to 2000 - 3000.
02/02/24, 11:13 am - Harmehak: I am glad you thoroughly followed the entire document, Evans!

Did you happen to discuss the same with your mother?
02/02/24, 11:23 am - +263 71 410 1209: Yes, we discussed but she said the decision  is going to be based  on the Scholarship percentage you are going to be given.
02/02/24, 11:34 am - Harmehak: I understand.
02/02/24, 11:34 am - Harmehak: In simple words Evans, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
02/02/24, 11:34 am - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.

What are your thoughts on the same?
02/02/24, 12:00 pm - +263 71 410 1209: Well, I'm very happy to hear that you will pay minimum fee of 1200 - 1800 for a greater performance 💫, I wish to study hardest.
02/02/24, 12:02 pm - +263 71 410 1209: And also to be part of *Earn While You Learn program* so as to reduce burden to my mother.
02/02/24, 12:08 pm - +263 71 410 1209: Sorry for giving you a titbit of the least of programs that I wish to pursue all of them are :


1. Computer science 
2. IT 
3.Banking and finance 
4. Accounting 
5. Marketing 
6. Human resource 
7. Purchasing and supply
02/02/24, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: While I understand Evans!

Would you agree with me that Computer Science, Accounting and Business Administration are three different degrees?
02/02/24, 12:25 pm - +263 71 410 1209: Yes I understand, I want one of those programs.
02/02/24, 12:26 pm - +263 71 410 1209: Given the opportunity.
02/02/24, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
02/02/24, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: Which out of three are you most inclined towards, Evans?
02/02/24, 12:39 pm - +263 71 410 1209: Computer science Ms. Harmehak.
02/02/24, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: In that case, why didn't you pursue Computers in your A level as well, Evans?
02/02/24, 12:59 pm - +263 71 410 1209: Well, At Morgan high they do not offer Computers at A level and also at ordinary level I did not wrote computers due to the  School rules, only class B was given computers. 

 Since the world is going Digital Ms. Harmehak I wish to pursue Computer science or even IT but I am not saying I will not take one of the maintioned programs above.
02/02/24, 1:04 pm - Harmehak: I do understand, Evans!

I appreciate your honesty, so now considering your interests and results, 

You are eligible to pursue Bachelors in Computer Applications.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
02/02/24, 3:24 pm - +263 71 410 1209: Yes, Ms. Harmehak we discussed that but she said 6000-8000 is too much, that is why I'm actively looking for Edoofa's scholarship.
02/02/24, 3:27 pm - Harmehak: That's very correct;
02/02/24, 3:27 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
02/02/24, 3:27 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
02/02/24, 3:27 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 3:37 pm - +263 71 410 1209: I was so excited to hear that Earn While You Learn program can reduce costs Ms. Harmehak
02/02/24, 3:37 pm - +263 71 410 1209: But I would also like to ask if you give me the chance.
02/02/24, 3:37 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Evans, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
02/02/24, 3:37 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.

I believe you would recall the same? <This message was edited>
02/02/24, 3:42 pm - +263 71 410 1209: Okay, Ms. Harmehak, it is my wish to be one of the students who pay $1200-$1800.
02/02/24, 3:46 pm - Harmehak: We do look forward to the same.
02/02/24, 3:47 pm - Harmehak: Currently we are in the Counseling session,

By the end of it, we would have discussed regarding the process as well as the interview to check your eligibility.
02/02/24, 3:52 pm - +263 71 410 1209: Thank you very much, I will be looking forward to get it.
02/02/24, 3:53 pm - +263 71 410 1209: Okay, that is great.
02/02/24, 3:54 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
02/02/24, 3:54 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
02/02/24, 3:54 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
02/02/24, 3:54 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

02/02/24, 4:09 pm - +263 71 410 1209: Thank you Ms. Harmehak. I understood.
02/02/24, 4:13 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
02/02/24, 4:23 pm - +263 71 410 1209: That's so great I would like to know more about the earn while you learn program.
02/02/24, 4:24 pm - Harmehak: Sure please!
02/02/24, 4:24 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

02/02/24, 4:37 pm - +263 71 410 1209: Yes, I can realize that and I believe there is a lot to learn about Edoofa's financial aid!
02/02/24, 4:37 pm - Harmehak: Persistence is a boy please!
02/02/24, 4:38 pm - Harmehak: That is great, 

So Evans, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
02/02/24, 4:39 pm - +263 71 410 1209: Okay, Ms Harmehak.
02/02/24, 4:41 pm - +263 71 410 1209: Born ready Ms. Harmehak.
02/02/24, 4:44 pm - Harmehak: Evans, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
02/02/24, 4:44 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
02/02/24, 5:04 pm - +263 71 410 1209: $1500-$2250 Ms. Harmehak
02/02/24, 5:05 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
02/02/24, 5:05 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
02/02/24, 5:05 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 5:10 pm - +263 71 410 1209: Understood, Ms. Harmehak.
02/02/24, 5:10 pm - Harmehak: Evans, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so, Evans? <This message was edited>
02/02/24, 5:20 pm - +263 71 410 1209: Yes, I think so
02/02/24, 5:23 pm - +263 71 410 1209: Sorry, Ms. Harmehak my phone is dead.
02/02/24, 5:24 pm - Harmehak: I understand!
02/02/24, 5:24 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
02/02/24, 5:24 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
02/02/24, 5:24 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
02/02/24, 6:17 pm - +263 71 410 1209: Okay, understood.
02/02/24, 6:18 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
02/02/24, 6:18 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 6:18 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
02/02/24, 6:18 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
02/02/24, 6:29 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now, Evans?
02/02/24, 6:30 pm - +263 71 410 1209: Yes I understood Ms. Harmehak. 

Okay, but the quality of decision we made as a family Ms. Harmehak lies on the Scholarship percentage you will give us. There is a certain budget my mother made so if the expenses are very low enough to meet our budget then Edoofa's scholarship will become more desirable.

However, As for me I wish to be part and parcel of Edoofians.
02/02/24, 6:32 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
02/02/24, 6:32 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
02/02/24, 6:32 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
02/02/24, 6:32 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 6:39 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
02/02/24, 6:39 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
02/02/24, 6:39 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 6:44 pm - +263 71 410 1209: I can not  wait to meet Mutsambiwa Bernadette.
02/02/24, 6:45 pm - Harmehak: We do look forward to the same Evans!
02/02/24, 6:45 pm - Harmehak: Do connect with Mrs Ruth and connect her with your mother as well!
02/02/24, 6:59 pm - +263 71 410 1209: That is great Ms. Harmehak but my mother has also a lot of questions to ask pertaining the scholarship percentage.
02/02/24, 6:59 pm - Harmehak: Yes please?
02/02/24, 7:00 pm - +263 71 410 1209: Well explained by Tapiwa Mandongwe.
02/02/24, 7:00 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!
02/02/24, 7:00 pm - +263 71 410 1209: Thanks for giving me that.
02/02/24, 7:01 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome!
02/02/24, 7:01 pm - Harmehak: What would she like to ask please?
02/02/24, 7:05 pm - +263 71 410 1209: She said how then decisions are going to be made if we do not know the scholarship percentage? Is it going to be a mare guess work or... ?

What if the scholarship percentage is very high while I inject $350 for a fee.
02/02/24, 7:06 pm - Harmehak: After your interview, if you are accepted into the program,

You would receive an Acceptance Letter where your if you manage to get a higher quantum of scholarship, it will be mentioned.
02/02/24, 7:06 pm - Harmehak: You pay the fee after receiving an Acceptance letter only.
02/02/24, 7:09 pm - +263 71 410 1209: Okay, so let's proceed. I will ask by myself if you permit me.
02/02/24, 7:10 pm - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate, Evans?
02/02/24, 7:26 pm - +263 71 410 1209: Well, thank you, very sorry maybe for asking what you have mentioned already.

Assuming that I'm one of the exceptional students and I have achieved 100% scholarships does that mean Edoofa will pay $8000 for me?
02/02/24, 7:27 pm - Harmehak: May I know your understanding of a 100% scholarship since you already went through the document as well, Evans?
02/02/24, 8:03 pm - Harmehak: What do you recall, Evans?
02/02/24, 8:28 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
02/02/24, 8:28 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
02/02/24, 8:28 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

02/02/24, 8:28 pm - Harmehak: And for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have.
02/02/24, 8:28 pm - Harmehak: I would also like to share the Certificate of Incorporation of our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. Do share the same with your parents so that if they would like to confirm anything they could get it confirmed please.

Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!
02/02/24, 9:06 pm - +263 71 410 1209: Please consider this, ☝️☝️ maybe you  can help me to understand better Ms. Harmehak.

My own understanding on the 100% scholarship is 100% of $40 is 40, 100% of $900 is $900. 

However Edoofa offers scholarship on Tuition according to the PDF that you gave me.

So my question is, if someone gets 50%Scholarships does that mean he /she pays $5000 - $7000. Basing on information above ☝️☝️. Mathematically consider the paper below
02/02/24, 9:08 pm - +263 71 410 1209: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 9:27 pm - +263 71 410 1209: Nice pictures by the way.
02/02/24, 9:29 pm - Harmehak: Let me help you have a better clarity, Evans!
02/02/24, 9:30 pm - Harmehak: $2000-$3000 is the fee after the scholarship for all students who are found eligible which includes Tuition fee, Accomodation, Food and Basic University Expenses.

There are separate or add on costs.
02/02/24, 9:31 pm - Harmehak: Now if you manage to get a higher quantum of scholarship, that is between $1200-1800.

Then your fee for a year which includes Tuition fee, Accomodation, Food and Basic University Expenses would be between $1200-1800 only.
02/02/24, 9:36 pm - +263 71 410 1209: Thank you for that Ms. Harmehak. Sleep well.
02/02/24, 9:37 pm - Harmehak: You too, Evans!
