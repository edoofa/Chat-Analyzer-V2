02/12/23, 10:20 am - +263 77 390 6328: Ok
02/12/23, 10:21 am - Harmehak: Alright so Mrs Cathrine, before we proceed ahead, I would like to know you and Mr Patson better as parents.

02/12/23, 10:46 am - +263 77 390 6328: Iam the mother  of Delight and Patson is my husband 
Currently  I worked under ministry of health and child care iam a nurse my husband  is a Prisoner officer we are very happy as parents for our child to go further with education especially  at your University  in your country  it's our pleasure  thank you very much  we are wait to hearing from you
02/12/23, 10:49 am - Harmehak: Well received Mrs Cathrine, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself please.
02/12/23, 10:50 am - +263 77 390 6328: You are welcome
02/12/23, 10:50 am - Harmehak: Now, I would like to know Elias better as a student,

How he is at school, his interest and hobbies along with anything that you would like to share about him?
02/12/23, 11:04 am - +263 77 390 6328: Sorry  for delay  Anyway  My son is better  at school naturally  he is intelligence  
He is interested in sports especially  football  and watching  movies (Indians)
02/12/23, 11:09 am - Harmehak: It's a pleasure to know more about him, Mrs Cathrine.
02/12/23, 11:09 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
02/12/23, 11:18 am - +263 77 390 6328: Yes

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
25/01/24, 6:20 pm - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation, Elias!
25/01/24, 7:23 pm - +263 78 311 0853: Sorry mem my has been shut down due to low battery
25/01/24, 7:25 pm - Harmehak: I understand!
25/01/24, 7:25 pm - Harmehak: Kindly address the same!
25/01/24, 7:41 pm - +263 78 311 0853: Thank you
25/01/24, 7:50 pm - Harmehak: I await your response, Elias.
25/01/24, 7:53 pm - +263 78 311 0853: Studying in India cover tuition fees, accommodate and canteen costs. Moreover, studying in India is affordable,accessible and lead to employment.
25/01/24, 7:53 pm - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
25/01/24, 7:54 pm - Harmehak: I believe you would recall the earlier discussions regarding the financial aspect, Elias?
25/01/24, 7:56 pm - +263 78 311 0853: Okay mem
25/01/24, 7:57 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

*1. Robust Education System:* India boasts the world's third-largest education system, comprising 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges. This extensive infrastructure provides students with a diverse range of educational opportunities.

25/01/24, 8:20 pm - Harmehak: You're welcome,

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
25/01/24, 8:32 pm - +263 78 311 0853: May you further explain mem this l didn't understand mem
25/01/24, 8:32 pm - Harmehak: Are you aware of the costs of education in India without any scholarship for an international student, Elias?
25/01/24, 8:37 pm - +263 78 311 0853: No l am not aware mem
25/01/24, 8:38 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
25/01/24, 8:38 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
25/01/24, 8:42 pm - +263 78 311 0853: Let me and my family discuss about it
25/01/24, 8:43 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
25/01/24, 8:43 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
25/01/24, 8:43 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 8:47 pm - +263 78 311 0853: Okay mem
25/01/24, 8:48 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
