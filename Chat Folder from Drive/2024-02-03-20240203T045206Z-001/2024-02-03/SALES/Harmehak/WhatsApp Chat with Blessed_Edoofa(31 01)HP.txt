02/02/24, 12:56 pm - +263 77 588 7387: I understand now why Edoofa is the best
02/02/24, 1:03 pm - +263 77 822 0336: I get the truth of Edoofa as the best and even the way it makes to be successful and I am inspired or enlighten with the spirit of excellent by Edoofa...
02/02/24, 1:25 pm - +263 77 822 0336: Wonderful
02/02/24, 1:28 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, please!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
02/02/24, 1:45 pm - +263 77 588 7387: We dont have but we  need scholarship
02/02/24, 1:51 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please.
02/02/24, 1:51 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
02/02/24, 1:51 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
02/02/24, 1:51 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
02/02/24, 1:51 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 2:04 pm - +263 77 588 7387: I understand but I have question can I ask now
02/02/24, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
02/02/24, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if he is able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, he would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
02/02/24, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: Yes please?
02/02/24, 2:18 pm - +263 77 822 0336: Alright
02/02/24, 2:18 pm - +263 77 822 0336: Alright
02/02/24, 2:24 pm - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the costs after the higher quantum of scholarship, please?
02/02/24, 2:29 pm - +263 77 588 7387: I will not say more I just say this is good affordable
02/02/24, 2:34 pm - +263 77 588 7387: What about if you give us Scholarship then we we want to apply for loan for remaining balance I will be given or not
02/02/24, 2:35 pm - Harmehak: I didn't get you please.

Can you rephrase?
02/02/24, 2:37 pm - +263 77 588 7387: Okay my question is that Can I apply for a loan for remaining  tuition fees after Scholarship
02/02/24, 2:38 pm - Harmehak: You wish to apply for a loan where exactly please?
02/02/24, 2:51 pm - +263 77 588 7387: From EDOOFA
02/02/24, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: We only assist with Scholarship on tuition fee, Mrs Idah.
02/02/24, 3:14 pm - +263 77 588 7387: Okay
02/02/24, 3:15 pm - Harmehak: You see, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
02/02/24, 3:30 pm - +263 77 588 7387: I agree
02/02/24, 3:36 pm - Harmehak: So now that you have compared the costs of those in Zimbabwe and in India!

Are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Mrs Idah?
02/02/24, 3:47 pm - +263 77 588 7387: 100% Yes
02/02/24, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: So now that you are aware of the costs, are you and Mr Stephen willing to support Blessed financially?
02/02/24, 4:09 pm - +263 77 588 7387: Yes
02/02/24, 4:11 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!

So what is your financial plan to support, Blessed?
02/02/24, 6:47 pm - +263 77 588 7387: I'm working and also doing farming
