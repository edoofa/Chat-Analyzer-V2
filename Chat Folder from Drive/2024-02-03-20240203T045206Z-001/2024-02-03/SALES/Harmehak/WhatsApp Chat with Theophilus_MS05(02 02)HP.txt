You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
02/02/24, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa.

02/02/24, 1:29 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome
02/02/24, 1:30 pm - Harmehak: Alright so Mr Tapuwa, before we proceed ahead, I would like to know you and Mrs Sekayi better as parents. 

Kindly go ahead, share a bit with us about yourself, what do you do, what is your highest qualification, and what motivates you to support your child ahead for education?
02/02/24, 1:45 pm - +263 77 374 7918: My name is Tapuwa Madhoyo born and bread in Chipinge District on 01/09/82. I did my A level at Chibuwe High in 2002 and thus my highest level. I was majoring in Maths, Physics and Geography and obtained 7 points. I am failed to proceed to University due to lack of funding since  my father had passed on in 1987. I married Sekayi Chitombo in 2003 when she completed her O level. We were blessed with our first born Theophilus Madhoyo in June 2003. I then worked as temporary teacher in 2006. Currently I am employed as a policeman. My child's performance is the key motivational tool to me for him to go to University. Another thing is that my children must not attain the same level as I did. They must aim higher than what I did since we are living in a world that is changing to better lever as compared to the period when I grew up
02/02/24, 1:49 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Mr Tapuwa, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

02/02/24, 3:07 pm - +263 77 374 7918: Mentally l can support him but financially I am crippled. I am just a mere civil servant.
02/02/24, 3:13 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please,

02/02/24, 3:24 pm - +263 77 374 7918: Yes. Financially with reasonable amount I can afford.
02/02/24, 3:27 pm - +263 77 374 7918: If I have the amount required I will make effort to find that amount
02/02/24, 3:29 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your support and we shall discuss how the costs are made affordable too, Mr Tapuwa.
02/02/24, 3:29 pm - Harmehak: I believe Theophilus wishes to study Electrical engineering, Mr Tapuwa?
02/02/24, 3:45 pm - +263 77 374 7918: Yes

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
02/02/24, 5:04 pm - +263 77 926 8481: India is one of the best countries which produces high qualified, problem solving Engineers
02/02/24, 5:04 pm - Harmehak: That's very correct!
02/02/24, 5:04 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

02/02/24, 5:09 pm - +263 77 926 8481: Waal , that's grt
02/02/24, 5:10 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Theophilus.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
02/02/24, 5:38 pm - +263 77 926 8481: Yes
02/02/24, 5:52 pm - Harmehak: Can you share your knowledge with me as well?
02/02/24, 6:04 pm - +263 77 926 8481: There is need of _accomodation and  _Tuition fees, food, processing of travelling documents, air ticket and health facilities. These sum up to a high demand of a lot of money.
02/02/24, 6:04 pm - Harmehak: Thats very correct!
02/02/24, 6:04 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
02/02/24, 6:05 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
02/02/24, 6:05 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
02/02/24, 6:05 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 6:06 pm - +263 77 926 8481: Also materials and equipment used in engineering courses cost a lot of money so as to have a well skilled personnel
02/02/24, 6:06 pm - Harmehak: Thats indeed very correct!
02/02/24, 6:15 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Theophilius, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
02/02/24, 6:15 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that as per your great results, *if you are able to perform well and clear the interview with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1600-$2300*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition and Basic University Expenses like Library, Laundry, Gym, Wifi.

What are your thoughts on the same?
02/02/24, 6:27 pm - +263 77 926 8481: If I am eligible I think my father would be able to finance me to have a study in India. I will be proud of myself.
02/02/24, 6:28 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate the same, Theophilius!
02/02/24, 6:28 pm - Harmehak: Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
02/02/24, 6:28 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
02/02/24, 6:28 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
02/02/24, 6:28 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

02/02/24, 6:37 pm - +263 77 926 8481: Thank you.
02/02/24, 6:38 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please,

However, feel free to question, I would be more than happy to assist.

02/02/24, 6:43 pm - +263 77 926 8481: SEO and   AI stand for what? Some of the terms like skooqs and Blog  means what?.
02/02/24, 6:45 pm - Harmehak: Skoops is an Edtech Company.

AI is Artificial Intelligence.

SEO is Search Engine Operation.

A blog, short for weblog, is a frequently updated web page used for personal commentary or business content. Blogs are often interactive and include sections at the bottom of individual blog posts where readers can leave comments.
02/02/24, 6:47 pm - +263 77 926 8481: Thank you
02/02/24, 6:47 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome, Theophilus!
02/02/24, 6:47 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
02/02/24, 6:58 pm - +263 77 926 8481: EWYL is a good move or initiative done by Edoofa. Since some of the degree programmes took a long period of time for a student abroad, this will assist them to have some money for immediate use. Also this will help students to gain more experience and exposure in their fields of study. Since a student will be given cash he will be able to pay other demanding educational needs hence reducing high demand from the parents which will promptly assist parents to send other children to school.
02/02/24, 6:59 pm - Harmehak: While you thoroughly understood the Earn While You Learn Program.
02/02/24, 6:59 pm - Harmehak: I would like to correct that you are given credits and not physical cash that is equivalent to cash itself.
02/02/24, 7:01 pm - +263 77 926 8481: Thank you. These credits will assist in a long way to cater for the period whilst abroad.
02/02/24, 7:02 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate, Theophilus!
02/02/24, 7:03 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

02/02/24, 7:34 pm - +263 77 926 8481: Yes it is. Seen and appreciate
02/02/24, 7:34 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
02/02/24, 7:36 pm - +263 77 926 8481: Yes
02/02/24, 7:36 pm - Harmehak: Theophilus, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
02/02/24, 7:36 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
02/02/24, 7:42 pm - +263 77 926 8481: Ranging from 1500 to 2250
02/02/24, 7:42 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
02/02/24, 7:42 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
02/02/24, 7:42 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 7:47 pm - +263 77 926 8481: Okay
02/02/24, 7:47 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
02/02/24, 7:49 pm - +263 77 926 8481: Yes l do
02/02/24, 7:50 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
02/02/24, 7:50 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
02/02/24, 7:50 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
02/02/24, 7:54 pm - +263 77 926 8481: Okay
02/02/24, 7:55 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
02/02/24, 7:55 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 7:55 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
02/02/24, 7:55 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
02/02/24, 7:58 pm - +263 77 926 8481: Understood
02/02/24, 7:59 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
02/02/24, 7:59 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
02/02/24, 7:59 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

02/02/24, 8:02 pm - +263 77 926 8481: Ok
02/02/24, 8:03 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
02/02/24, 8:03 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

02/02/24, 8:07 pm - +263 77 926 8481: Thanks
02/02/24, 8:08 pm - Harmehak: So far, would you like to ask anything, Theophilus?
02/02/24, 8:08 pm - +263 77 926 8481: No
02/02/24, 8:08 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
02/02/24, 8:09 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
02/02/24, 8:09 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
02/02/24, 8:09 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.
