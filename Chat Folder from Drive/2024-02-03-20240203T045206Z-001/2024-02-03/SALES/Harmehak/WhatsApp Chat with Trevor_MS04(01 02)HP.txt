l did my primary in Goromonzi then my secondary level at Mount Selinda.
O leve results were great since l scored all my subjects.
Then A level at Mount Selinda again.

I have always wanted to be an aircraft technician and that is why at A level l chose to do mathematics, physics and geography and l think what you have just offered me is a great opportunity to fullfil my dreams.
During my free time, l enjoy playing soccer and l happen to also be good at it since l was elected as the school team's captain in my senior year.

so l consider this as a very big opportunity which l don't want to just pass by.

l think this is me.
01/02/24, 9:58 am - +263 77 560 7934: sorry am a little bit caught up with work from my superiors but am in full support, please do process. Am sorry l won't be responding sooner
01/02/24, 9:58 am - Harmehak: I do understand!
01/02/24, 9:58 am - Harmehak: Trevor, you can introduce your parents in such a scenario!
01/02/24, 10:01 am - +263 77 492 8619: My name is Followme Toronga, a father of 3 children Trevor being our second born, I'm a program assistant with the Zimbabwe National Family Planning council.

01/02/24, 10:21 am - Harmehak: Well Trevor now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
01/02/24, 10:31 am - +263 78 989 9828: yah, l believe it's life changing thing. Especially with this program l wish to do, l believe it requires one to be sharp and be observant of how other students with the same program would want to do in life since in here there are few opportunities where you can get that. l also believe the program itself is life changing since it markets it's own self world wide, so abroad am very certain that am going to to excel since there are adequate resources unlike in here
01/02/24, 10:37 am - Harmehak: Well put across Trevor!

You managed to express your thoughts well!

So would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
01/02/24, 10:38 am - +263 78 989 9828: thank you mam
01/02/24, 10:39 am - +263 78 989 9828: yah, l think am all set

01/02/24, 11:18 am - +263 78 989 9828: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 11:20 am - Harmehak: Received please!

I can see you didn't perform well in Physics while you couldn't manage to clear Geography!

May I know what happened please?
01/02/24, 11:24 am - +263 78 989 9828: in physics it was just hard since l wasn't in the science class at o level so l picked it at a higher level but goe they said my results weren't not conclusive
01/02/24, 12:01 pm - Harmehak: I can understand,

However I believe you would agree with me that Physics happen to a crucial subject for Engineering, isn't it?
01/02/24, 12:17 pm - +263 78 989 9828: l agree
01/02/24, 12:18 pm - Harmehak: So how are you planning your Engineering course considering your results in Physics please, Trevor?
01/02/24, 12:20 pm - +263 78 989 9828: but l need help
01/02/24, 12:22 pm - +263 78 989 9828: honestly, l know if given a chance, l can do it that's why l need your help
01/02/24, 12:33 pm - Harmehak: I understand!
01/02/24, 12:34 pm - +263 77 560 7934: sorry for catching up late, l went through all messages
01/02/24, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
01/02/24, 12:34 pm - +263 77 560 7934: please would you assist my child cos all hope is on you!
01/02/24, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: However, I thoroughly believe that with your grades if you wish to pursue Engineering itself, you would qualify for Electrical Engineering as well as Computer Science Engineering!
01/02/24, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please.
01/02/24, 12:37 pm - +263 78 989 9828: ok, so can l do electrical?
01/02/24, 12:44 pm - Harmehak: Yes please!

You are eligible to pursue Electrical Engineering or Computer Science Engineering as per your results, Trevor.

While the other engineering courses require Chemistry as well as better results in Physics too!
01/02/24, 12:48 pm - +263 77 492 8619: Ok then that's good
01/02/24, 12:49 pm - +263 77 492 8619: This message was deleted
01/02/24, 12:49 pm - Harmehak: Let me share a thorough description of the course

01/02/24, 12:50 pm - +263 77 492 8619: Thank you so what is he expected to do
01/02/24, 12:53 pm - +263 77 492 8619: thank you mam
01/02/24, 12:56 pm - +263 78 989 9828: l would be honored
01/02/24, 1:04 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please!
01/02/24, 1:04 pm - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate?
01/02/24, 1:06 pm - +263 78 989 9828: l appreciate
01/02/24, 1:10 pm - Harmehak: Would you like to pursue the same, Trevor?
01/02/24, 1:11 pm - +263 78 989 9828: yes! sure l would love it
01/02/24, 1:13 pm - Harmehak: Alright so Trevor, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
01/02/24, 1:19 pm - +263 78 989 9828: in 5 years l won't be the same cause this would have opened many doors for me. l would be someone much greater since l would have pursue my studies as well as marketed myself to many carrier opportunities
01/02/24, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Trevor, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
01/02/24, 1:26 pm - +263 78 989 9828: resources! in here there are inadequate resources and study in here would make your degree less valuable than abroad, exposure being a minor consideration
01/02/24, 1:26 pm - Harmehak: You see, Trevor, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
01/02/24, 1:32 pm - +263 78 989 9828: yah for sure! and that is why l consider this as a life changing opportunity in my life
01/02/24, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: That is wonderful Trevor, it's good that you are making efforts for a promising future.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
01/02/24, 1:40 pm - +263 78 989 9828: during my research, l discovered that India is one of the highly rated countries when it comes to science department
highly rated doctor, engineers and such good products can only come when people are exposed to highly educational facilities that is why l believe it's a dream come true if l studied in a country like that
01/02/24, 1:42 pm - Harmehak: I am delighted to know that you did research, Trevor!
01/02/24, 1:42 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

*1. Robust Education System:* India boasts the world's third-largest education system, comprising 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges. This extensive infrastructure provides students with a diverse range of educational opportunities.

01/02/24, 1:49 pm - +263 78 989 9828: so all these successful people are Indian products ??
01/02/24, 1:56 pm - Harmehak: Can you please address as to what would mean by referring them as products?
01/02/24, 1:57 pm - +263 78 989 9828: l meant they all came to be successful as this after studying in India??
01/02/24, 1:58 pm - Harmehak: Yes please!

They are all Indians itself!
01/02/24, 1:58 pm - Harmehak: I believe you must have learnt alot regarding the Country as well the Education System, Trevor?
01/02/24, 1:59 pm - +263 78 989 9828: so l wouldn't want to be left out too, i dream to be one of them
01/02/24, 2:00 pm - +263 78 989 9828: yah, l guess fair enough
01/02/24, 2:09 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
01/02/24, 2:14 pm - +263 78 989 9828: l don't know about others but am not
01/02/24, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
01/02/24, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
01/02/24, 2:16 pm - +263 78 989 9828: ok so how does Edoofa make it affordable
01/02/24, 2:31 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
01/02/24, 2:31 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
01/02/24, 2:31 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 2:33 pm - +263 78 989 9828: that's very good
01/02/24, 2:34 pm - +263 78 989 9828: ohk, so there are some other tests to be done?
01/02/24, 2:40 pm - Harmehak: Currently we are in the Counseling stage later on you will participate in test and interview!
01/02/24, 2:40 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
01/02/24, 2:41 pm - +263 78 989 9828: ohky mam
01/02/24, 2:45 pm - +263 78 989 9828: l think that's very helpful of you, that way we can receive high quality education at a much easier amount. Really you are helping alot
01/02/24, 2:47 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please, Trevor!
01/02/24, 2:47 pm - Harmehak: Trevor, from Mr Piyush's experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
01/02/24, 2:50 pm - +263 78 989 9828: yes, that's very true
01/02/24, 3:01 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Trevor?
01/02/24, 3:01 pm - +263 78 989 9828: sure l am, am looking forward to finding out more
01/02/24, 3:09 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
01/02/24, 3:09 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
01/02/24, 3:09 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
01/02/24, 3:09 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

01/02/24, 4:00 pm - +263 78 989 9828: that's great
01/02/24, 4:00 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
01/02/24, 4:11 pm - +263 78 989 9828: experience being the first helpful thing to a student, it also is a motivation to a student since that would reduce the burden of annual fee to the people back home. On my view l see it as an opportunity for one to exceed to greater levels since your performance will determine your earn, above all you will be marketing yourself
01/02/24, 4:15 pm - Harmehak: It's great to know of your thorough understanding of the Earn While You Learn Program, Trevor!
01/02/24, 4:16 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

01/02/24, 4:21 pm - +263 78 989 9828: yah, that's very helpful of u
01/02/24, 4:23 pm - Harmehak: That is great,

So now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
01/02/24, 4:26 pm - +263 78 989 9828: l am
01/02/24, 4:33 pm - Harmehak: Trevor as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
01/02/24, 4:37 pm - +263 78 989 9828: that's right, there is no guarantee so one will apply more than one university but yes, it's very costly
01/02/24, 4:39 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
01/02/24, 4:39 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
01/02/24, 4:39 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 4:40 pm - +263 78 989 9828: ohk l think they can hear for themselves
01/02/24, 4:41 pm - +263 77 560 7934: ohk but does it have a due date??
01/02/24, 4:43 pm - +263 78 989 9828: thank you mam, that's great
01/02/24, 4:43 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
01/02/24, 4:45 pm - +263 78 989 9828: yah that's indeed an great burden they have lift away for parents
01/02/24, 4:46 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
01/02/24, 4:46 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
01/02/24, 4:46 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
01/02/24, 4:50 pm - +263 78 989 9828: ok mam, l think they can also hear that
01/02/24, 4:54 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
01/02/24, 4:55 pm - Harmehak: I hope now you have a better clarity please?
01/02/24, 4:55 pm - +263 78 989 9828: yes l clearly do
01/02/24, 5:00 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
01/02/24, 5:00 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 5:01 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
01/02/24, 5:01 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
01/02/24, 5:02 pm - +263 78 989 9828: understood
01/02/24, 5:04 pm - +263 78 989 9828: correctly understood
01/02/24, 5:08 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please!
01/02/24, 5:09 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
01/02/24, 5:09 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
01/02/24, 5:09 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

01/02/24, 5:11 pm - +263 78 989 9828: noted
01/02/24, 5:12 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
01/02/24, 5:12 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

01/02/24, 5:30 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate, Trevor
01/02/24, 5:30 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
01/02/24, 5:30 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
01/02/24, 5:30 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

02/02/24, 11:50 am - +263 78 989 9828: from the discussion we had they had questions yes but l would refer them to some of the messages you sent, so they don't have much to ask.
02/02/24, 12:12 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, Trevor!
02/02/24, 12:13 pm - Harmehak: Have you and your parent already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? 

You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future.
02/02/24, 12:19 pm - +263 78 989 9828: they are still trying to get hold of her but she seems offline
02/02/24, 12:21 pm - Harmehak: Alright please.

02/02/24, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*
02/02/24, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 12:33 pm - +263 78 989 9828: thank you mam
02/02/24, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: Okay so Trevor, can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. Through Edoofa in which country would you be pursuing your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in that country without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program (yearly fee after Edoofa Scholarship)?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
02/02/24, 12:54 pm - +263 78 989 9828: l would be doing electrical engineering in India under Edoofa program.
And they make studying abroad easy as they reduce cost from $8000 to $2000-3000 per annual making it affordable for us.
The enrollment fee is $350 and if found eligible you have to pay the enrollment fee within 7 days after receiving the acceptance letter.
And yes am clear with question number 7 too
02/02/24, 12:55 pm - Harmehak: Very correct!

So are your parents willing to support you for the same, Trevor?
02/02/24, 12:56 pm - +263 78 989 9828: a 100% mam
02/02/24, 12:57 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!

Could you please request them to acknowledge the same using a voice note once available, Trevor?
02/02/24, 1:00 pm - +263 78 989 9828: yes mam, sure l will
02/02/24, 1:00 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted!

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

02/02/24, 8:27 pm - Harmehak: Well received please, you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
02/02/24, 8:27 pm - Harmehak: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
02/02/24, 8:27 pm - Harmehak: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
02/02/24, 8:37 pm - +263 77 492 8619: l am willing to support in every way but l will need time to organize that amount but please do proceed
02/02/24, 8:38 pm - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
02/02/24, 8:38 pm - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
02/02/24, 8:38 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
02/02/24, 8:38 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 8:39 pm - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 11th or 12th February 2024 for $200 and the 11th or 12th of March for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 11th or 12th February 2024. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
02/02/24, 8:47 pm - +263 77 492 8619: Correctly understood let's proceed
02/02/24, 9:32 pm - Harmehak: Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
