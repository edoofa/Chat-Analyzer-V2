30/01/24, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!

30/01/24, 12:16 pm - +260 97 2368032: Yes that’s exactly what it is
30/01/24, 12:18 pm - Harmehak: *Alright so Tawonga, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD St Francis Secondary charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
30/01/24, 10:15 pm - +260 97 2368032: Sure🙏🏾
31/01/24, 9:37 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
31/01/24, 9:39 am - +260 97 2368032: Good morning, i am all good how are you
31/01/24, 9:48 am - Harmehak: I am expecting your response please!
31/01/24, 9:49 am - +260 97 2368032: I think it will be depending on the scholarship percentage I’ll be given
31/01/24, 9:50 am - Harmehak: Alright!
31/01/24, 9:50 am - Harmehak: Let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
31/01/24, 9:53 am - +260 97 2368032: I understand now
31/01/24, 10:04 am - Harmehak: So far, do you have any queries?
31/01/24, 10:05 am - +260 97 2368032: No queries
31/01/24, 10:10 am - Harmehak: Tawonga, considering the financial aspect and support!

Is your family willing to support you with roughly $1200-1400 a year?
31/01/24, 10:30 am - +260 97 2368032: Yes
31/01/24, 10:38 am - Harmehak: Kindly request your mother to acknowledge the same using a voice note!
31/01/24, 10:39 am - +260 97 2368032: Sure
31/01/24, 10:41 am - +260 97 7870366: This message was deleted
31/01/24, 10:41 am - +260 97 7870366: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 10:46 am - Harmehak: I appreciate your acknowledgement, Mrs Mary.
31/01/24, 10:46 am - Harmehak: So now, kindly share your Academic results, Tawonga.
31/01/24, 10:46 am - +260 97 7870366: You are welcome
31/01/24, 10:47 am - +260 97 2368032: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 10:48 am - Harmehak: Received please,

So what motivates you to study Human Resource Management, Tawonga?
31/01/24, 10:51 am - +260 97 2368032: I feel I am able to work and relate well with people and i posses good leadership skills which may be efficient for the society at large
31/01/24, 11:13 am - Harmehak: Thats great, Tawonga!

Meanwhile are you aware that Human Resource Management studies are a part of Business Administration itsef?
31/01/24, 12:14 pm - +260 97 2368032: Yes  I am aware that it is under business administration
31/01/24, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: That's great!

Now let me brief you about your desired course!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
01/02/24, 11:23 am - +260 97 2368032: I have no idea about how much the fees are without a scholarship
01/02/24, 11:47 am - Harmehak: Alright please!
01/02/24, 11:47 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
01/02/24, 11:47 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
01/02/24, 11:47 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

01/02/24, 7:22 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
02/02/24, 9:52 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
02/02/24, 9:58 am - +260 97 2368032: Good morning
02/02/24, 10:04 am - Harmehak: Have you followed the discussion so far, Tawonga?
02/02/24, 10:09 am - +260 97 2368032: Yes I have, i have understood the cost of quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship <This message was edited>
02/02/24, 10:38 am - Harmehak: In simple words Tawonga, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
02/02/24, 10:40 am - +260 97 2368032: I see
02/02/24, 11:12 am - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the costs after higher quantum, Tawonga?
02/02/24, 3:07 pm - +260 97 2368032: I guess the fee’s after higher quantum are reasonable and Affordable as compared to other countries
02/02/24, 3:08 pm - Harmehak: Yes please.
02/02/24, 3:08 pm - Harmehak: Did you happen to discuss with your mother too?
02/02/24, 8:36 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 10 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Kindly ensure active participation tomorrow!*
