In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.

We have worked with 250+ universities here in India!

Now that every application and student is different and so are there academics, in the Admissions Process the student receivers multiple applications from different universities where there application would have qualified for.

01/02/24, 10:01 am - +263 71 402 1073: Noted. 

So for now how do we proceed or we wait for your communications and formulate the way forward using data received?
01/02/24, 10:03 am - Harmehak: We shall discuss the details today itself!

While the introductions were done with Trish earlier too!
01/02/24, 10:04 am - Harmehak: Now considering he would require financial support for his higher education,

Are you as guardians willing to provide the same?
01/02/24, 10:06 am - +263 71 402 1073: Considerations for support are place but largely depend on the information received.
01/02/24, 10:07 am - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate your queries?
01/02/24, 10:11 am - +263 71 402 1073: Previous you stated the Scholarship Program offers 50-100% scholarship on tution, so we will have to consider the structure of the tution for proposed Institutions.
01/02/24, 10:16 am - Harmehak: I do understand!
01/02/24, 10:16 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please? <This message was edited>
01/02/24, 11:07 am - +263 71 402 1073: Now i get you, this is where we are saying the information received would then make us profer a contribution towards the student.
