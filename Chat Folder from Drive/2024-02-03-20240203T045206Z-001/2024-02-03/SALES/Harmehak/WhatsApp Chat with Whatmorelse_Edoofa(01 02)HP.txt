So may I know your understanding of the scholarship, Mr Badza?

As to how would Whatmorelse be assisted as per your understanding of the program so far?
01/02/24, 9:18 am - +263 77 354 0686: Nothing ,take me through
01/02/24, 9:18 am - Harmehak: Mr Badza, would you agree with me that studying abroad would require financial support for Whatmorelse?
01/02/24, 9:19 am - +263 77 354 0686: Still to be guided, since I never experienced that.
01/02/24, 9:24 am - Harmehak: Let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.

01/02/24, 11:21 am - Harmehak: So far, what all would you like to ask?
01/02/24, 1:44 pm - +263 77 354 0686: Do you sponsor on university
01/02/24, 1:45 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa is a scholarship program please.
02/02/24, 9:32 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
02/02/24, 2:28 pm - +263 77 354 0686: Now yes
02/02/24, 2:40 pm - Harmehak: I would like to share a document with you for your better clarity regarding the program and the finances.
02/02/24, 2:41 pm - +263 77 354 0686: With pleasure
02/02/24, 2:46 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
