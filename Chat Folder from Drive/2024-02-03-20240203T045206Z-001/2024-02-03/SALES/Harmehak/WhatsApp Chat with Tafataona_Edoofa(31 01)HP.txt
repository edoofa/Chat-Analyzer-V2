02/02/24, 1:46 pm - Harmehak: You see, Tafataona, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
02/02/24, 1:58 pm - +263 78 404 6865: Its difficult over here as those students sayed and it be much difficult if i persue my higher education here in Zimbabwe
02/02/24, 2:11 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand, however I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future, Tafataona.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
02/02/24, 2:21 pm - +263 78 404 6865: Studying in India would help me achieve my dreams because studying in India would give me more chances of  being employed anywhere without struggles
02/02/24, 2:34 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate
02/02/24, 2:34 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

02/02/24, 2:44 pm - Harmehak: Did you thoroughly follow the shared resources, Tafataona?

If so, how do you believe studying in India will help you build a promising future?
02/02/24, 2:55 pm - +263 78 404 6865: Sorry im still going through them
02/02/24, 2:59 pm - +263 78 404 6865: Studying in India will help me build a promising future because it has quality education and research meaning in India I'll be among the bests and I'll learn the best
02/02/24, 3:02 pm - +263 78 404 6865: I'll also have a promising future in India beacause there will be a wide range of choices for me.again there is a prmising future for me in India because I'll have access to scholarships and affordable education
02/02/24, 3:05 pm - Harmehak: I am glad the resources intrigued you and you found it helpful!

I equally appreciate your thoughts on how it will help you after studying in India, Tafataona.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
02/02/24, 3:12 pm - +263 78 404 6865: 3 300USD to 7800USD per any academic year
02/02/24, 3:13 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
02/02/24, 3:13 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
02/02/24, 3:14 pm - +263 78 404 6865: Ok thank you
02/02/24, 3:14 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
02/02/24, 3:14 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
02/02/24, 3:14 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 3:17 pm - +263 78 404 6865: Ok
02/02/24, 3:17 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
02/02/24, 3:22 pm - +263 78 404 6865: I think its a great opportunity for me if get to become part of that
02/02/24, 3:23 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate, Tafataona,

So, from Mr Piyush's experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
02/02/24, 5:02 pm - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation.
02/02/24, 8:37 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 10 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Do ensure active participation tomorrow, Tafataona.*
