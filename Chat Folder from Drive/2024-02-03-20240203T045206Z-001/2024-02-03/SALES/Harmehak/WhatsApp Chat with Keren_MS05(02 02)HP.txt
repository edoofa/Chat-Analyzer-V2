02/02/24, 11:26 am - Harmehak: Well Keren now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
02/02/24, 11:37 am - +263 77 305 8214: Yes I believe it is. Especially considering the education standards and reputation of the nation of India. I strongly believe my life will completely change when I achieve a  recognised degree  from an accredited university in India through Eddofa Schoolarship Program. Thank you
02/02/24, 11:42 am - Harmehak: I am delighted to know that you have thorough awareness,

In such a scenario, would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too, Keren?
02/02/24, 11:54 am - +263 77 305 8214: I am prepared for a life abroad. I think life in a boarding school for the past six years being far away from my family has prepared me for that. I think I am ready to adapt to a new environment and setup. Thank you
02/02/24, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: Keren, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
02/02/24, 12:30 pm - +263 77 305 8214: Thank you Ms Harmehak. I am delighted to advise that my parents place much value on education. They always encourage us to do better than they did. I have a strong support of my parents and they also respect my career choices as we always engage in discussions regarding to career choice. 
I should say they are prepared to support my education abroad. Thank you
02/02/24, 12:32 pm - Harmehak: I am delighted to know regarding their support and preparation, Keren!

I believe you must be aware of Munashe Hlahla from the school?
02/02/24, 12:38 pm - +263 77 305 8214: Yes I am aware, we are together at Mt Selinda. I am happy for her success with Edoofa Schoolarship. 
I was just thinking that I won't feel lonely in India if I happen to be successful. Thank you
02/02/24, 12:41 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know that you and Munashe are good friends, Keren!
02/02/24, 12:41 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
02/02/24, 12:48 pm - +263 77 305 8214: We are best friends from the same school and also from the same community. It is our wish to sail through higher education together and transform our community.
02/02/24, 12:50 pm - +263 77 305 8214: That's fine Ms Harmehak. I promise to work hard and do my best. I am aiming at 15 points.
02/02/24, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful, Keren!
02/02/24, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: I am delighted to know that, Keren!

So what motivates you to study Pharmacy or Medicine?
02/02/24, 1:05 pm - +263 77 305 8214: The pandemics that sometimes hit our nation, like covid which was global, and the high demand for medical personnel worldwide motivates me choose this career path. I love to see people in good health and healthy communities. The study of this program will make me help contribute to the health of communities and countries. Thank you
02/02/24, 1:05 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your noble thoughts to help others, Keren!
02/02/24, 1:06 pm - Harmehak: So what all did you research regarding your desired course and it's requirements?
02/02/24, 1:20 pm - +263 77 305 8214: From the research I did I noted that it needs a good combination of subjects at A level to help prepare for the course. For instance, Maths, Biology and Chemistry which is my choice.

Again, someone must be a natural leader and I am happy to share with you that I am currently Prefect at Mt Selinda and it is helping me shape my leadership skills.
 In addition to that, I need much patience as this will help me deal with patients. Thank you
02/02/24, 1:23 pm - +263 77 305 8214: Again, I learnt that the field is a calling which is different from other fields and it requires commitment and dedication.
02/02/24, 1:24 pm - Harmehak: Well put across, Keren!

I appreciate your knowledge, research as well as your thoughts!
02/02/24, 1:24 pm - Harmehak: Since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
02/02/24, 1:36 pm - +263 77 305 8214: Well noted Ms Harmehak. May I ask Ma'am, what would you advise is the ideal career with my combination of subject and also in line with Edoofa Program7
02/02/24, 1:42 pm - Harmehak: Keren, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy*
02/02/24, 1:43 pm - Harmehak: Now you see, Medical Laboratory Technology (MLT) and Pharmacy may seem distinct, but they share fundamental similarities that contribute to the holistic field of healthcare.

Both fields are critical in patient care. MLT professionals analyze biological samples, providing essential data for diagnosis and treatment plans. Pharmacists, on the other hand, ensure that prescribed medications are dispensed accurately, educating patients on proper usage and potential interactions.

Continuous learning is a common thread. MLT and Pharmacy professionals stay up-to-date with advancements in medical science and pharmacology, ensuring that patients receive the most current and effective care.

Ultimately, both fields share a deep commitment to improving patient health. They complement each other, creating a collaborative healthcare ecosystem that prioritizes accurate diagnosis, safe medication management, and better overall patient outcomes. In essence, Medical Laboratory Technology and Pharmacy are two sides of the same coin, working harmoniously for the betterment of healthcare.
02/02/24, 1:54 pm - +263 77 305 8214: Thank you Ms Harmehak for guidance, I think let me take Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology. I am still comfortable with that because its medical field. Thank you
02/02/24, 1:55 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your thorough understanding, Keren.

I am glad that you following the discussion properly and sharing your inputs as well!

02/02/24, 2:15 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome Keren!
02/02/24, 2:15 pm - Harmehak: As of now, would you like to ask anything from our discussion so far?
02/02/24, 2:19 pm - +263 77 305 8214: So far so good Ms Harmehak, I  think I will be able to ask as we proceed. Thank you
02/02/24, 2:24 pm - Harmehak: Alright please.
02/02/24, 2:24 pm - Harmehak: Keren, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?

That is from financial assistance, enrolment with the best university in India and also facilitation of travels and stay abroad which I think Edoofa will be coordinating and make my study easy.
02/02/24, 2:41 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Keren, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
02/02/24, 2:50 pm - +263 77 305 8214: I would want to study abroad especially India due to its reputation in the Medical Field. I have always heard about many patience refered to India for complicated cases and these are successfully managed. That to. me signifies magnificent knowledge in the Medical Field and I would wish to be part of that. Thank you.
02/02/24, 2:51 pm - +263 77 305 8214: *patients*
02/02/24, 3:01 pm - Harmehak: That is correct, Keren!

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
02/02/24, 3:16 pm - +263 77 305 8214: Well from the research I have done India has the best Education System in the world  and it produces highly qualified professionals as compared to other countries. Its balanced approach system which incorporates culture in learning makes it unique and will help me appreciate diverse cultures in the process of achieving my dreams.
02/02/24, 3:18 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful, Keren.
02/02/24, 3:18 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

02/02/24, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Keren

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
02/02/24, 3:38 pm - +263 77 305 8214: No, I haven't done a research on that one. Kindly advise.
02/02/24, 3:38 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
02/02/24, 3:38 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
02/02/24, 3:38 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
02/02/24, 3:38 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
02/02/24, 3:38 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 3:48 pm - +263 77 305 8214: That's sounds  great and will make families afford education for us children. I think this program makes education accessible and fulfilment of all dreams regardless of background and nationality. I would like to thank you for coming up with such an idea/program.
02/02/24, 3:50 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words, Keren!
02/02/24, 3:50 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Keren, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
02/02/24, 3:50 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.

What are your thoughts on the same?
02/02/24, 3:57 pm - +263 77 305 8214: I understand and will work towards achieving high passing grades and am also interested in Earn While You Work Program which I view again as a privilege to acquire skills. Thank you
02/02/24, 3:57 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
02/02/24, 3:57 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
02/02/24, 3:58 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
02/02/24, 3:58 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

02/02/24, 4:04 pm - +263 77 305 8214: Well noted. It is such a wonderful program.
02/02/24, 4:09 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
02/02/24, 4:11 pm - +263 77 305 8214: I understand.
02/02/24, 4:13 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

02/02/24, 4:16 pm - +263 77 305 8214: That's great, I think would go for this program.
02/02/24, 4:17 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!
02/02/24, 4:17 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 4:22 pm - +263 77 305 8214: Sure that's my first time to hear of such program and I have noted how it supports students and the financial impact of the program with regards to tuition etc  Thank you
02/02/24, 4:23 pm - Harmehak: That is great, Keren!

So Keren, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
02/02/24, 4:24 pm - +263 77 305 8214: Yes am ready.
02/02/24, 4:24 pm - Harmehak: Keren, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
02/02/24, 4:25 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
02/02/24, 4:27 pm - +263 77 305 8214: That will be a minimum of usd 1500
02/02/24, 4:29 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
02/02/24, 4:29 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
02/02/24, 4:29 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 4:35 pm - Harmehak: You see, Keren, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
02/02/24, 4:38 pm - +263 77 305 8214: Yes I think so. Bundling everything will make the process much easier.
02/02/24, 4:41 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
02/02/24, 4:41 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
02/02/24, 4:41 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
02/02/24, 4:47 pm - +263 77 305 8214: Well noted. I think it is clear.
02/02/24, 4:47 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
02/02/24, 4:47 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 4:48 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
02/02/24, 4:48 pm - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
02/02/24, 4:48 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
02/02/24, 4:54 pm - +263 77 305 8214: Yes we are together Ms Harmehak.
02/02/24, 4:55 pm - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
02/02/24, 4:55 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 5:01 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
02/02/24, 5:01 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
02/02/24, 5:01 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 5:05 pm - +263 77 305 8214: Thank you, received. I get in touch with her.
02/02/24, 5:06 pm - Harmehak: Sure please.

Do request your parents to connect as well Keren.
02/02/24, 5:11 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
02/02/24, 5:11 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
