19/01/24, 10:14 am - Keshav Edoofa: I will explain about Edoofa scholarship program to you!
19/01/24, 10:14 am - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
19/01/24, 10:14 am - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
19/01/24, 10:14 am - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.

19/01/24, 10:14 am - Keshav Edoofa: It is with great pride that i would like to share with you that, recently we hosted a special conference for our Edoofians studying in India,  *SLICE - CON'24 - Symposium of Leaders, Innovators and Creators with Edoofa*, The students embarked on an enlightening industrial visit, immersing themselves in dynamic interactions with our esteemed Founders, CEOs, and visionary entrepreneurs. This is one of the many benefits of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and have a look at the glimpses of this auspicious 3 day event.
19/01/24, 10:24 am - +263 77 946 8554: Ok noted Mr
19/01/24, 10:24 am - +263 77 946 8554: That's Great Mr Keshav
19/01/24, 10:24 am - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
19/01/24, 10:25 am - +263 77 946 8554: That's it Sir
19/01/24, 10:26 am - Keshav Edoofa: As we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
19/01/24, 10:29 am - +263 77 946 8554: Yes Mr
19/01/24, 10:30 am - Keshav Edoofa: That is the spirit Tadiwanashe, well done!
19/01/24, 10:31 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so Tadiwanashe, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
19/01/24, 10:31 am - +263 77 946 8554: Thank you Mr Keshav
19/01/24, 10:42 am - Keshav Edoofa: Do kindly introduce yourself Tadiwanashe

19/01/24, 11:55 am - Keshav Edoofa: Can you tell me what was your term fee at Mamunyadza High school?
19/01/24, 1:08 pm - +263 77 946 8554: Um sorry Mr Keshav for late response network becomes a problem here
19/01/24, 1:08 pm - +263 77 946 8554: Our term fee at Mamunyadza was $70. US dolla
19/01/24, 1:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Noted Tadiwanashe
19/01/24, 1:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: May I know who has supported your tertiary education till now and who is going to support you financially with your higher education abroad?
19/01/24, 1:24 pm - +263 77 946 8554: Sir no one can afford to pay for tertiary level in family due to financial crisis
19/01/24, 1:26 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Then what is your family financial planning to assist you with your higher education abroad?
19/01/24, 1:28 pm - +263 77 946 8554: Actually I don't know sir
19/01/24, 1:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you are clarified that Edoofa provides scholarships to students that range from 50-100% on their yearly university fee and does not provide any sponsorship
19/01/24, 1:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Let me clarify further
19/01/24, 1:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.

22/01/24, 8:38 am - Keshav Edoofa: BSW, also termed as Bachelor of Social Work is a 3 year undergraduate degree course that provides knowledge and skills to work in the social sector, aiming to provide quality life as well as education. Social Work, as the name suggests, aims to provide each and every citizen, specifically the less priviledged ones, a dignified life worth living with all aspects of social amenities and equal justice.

*What is BSW Course*
BSW is a three-year undergraduate professional degree course majoring in the field of social work. A typical BSW degree course lasts three years and is broken down into six semesters.  In certain circumstances, candidates are required to finish the program within a maximum of six years. Candidates can enroll in BSW full-time or even as a correspondence or distance learning degree. There are three main components to the BSW course: the foundation course, the elective course, and the fieldwork.

BSW courses can be pursued in various colleges in the country. It is useful to candidates who may like to work in social welfare sectors as it helps them acquire professional skills and knowledge to help the clients deal with their emotional and psychological problems. The curriculum provides social work education and training based on indigenous knowledge. It helps the learner to develop the required attitudes in understanding people’s problem-solving interventions.

*Why Study BSW*

-BSW is specially meant for the ones who are aiming at improving the quality of life of the poorest of the poor and understand the growing demand for professionally trained social workers across the country.

God Bless You!
23/01/24, 9:26 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
23/01/24, 1:04 pm - +263 77 946 8554: Yes lets proceed
23/01/24, 1:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
23/01/24, 1:07 pm - +263 77 946 8554: No sir
23/01/24, 1:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
23/01/24, 1:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
23/01/24, 1:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
23/01/24, 1:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 1:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
23/01/24, 1:10 pm - +263 77 946 8554: Ok
23/01/24, 1:12 pm - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words Tadiwanashe what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
23/01/24, 1:29 pm - +263 77 946 8554: Ok ok Mr Keshav understood
23/01/24, 1:29 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
23/01/24, 4:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Well, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *Thursday at 9:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care and do watch the video I am sharing below.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
23/01/24, 4:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 8:40 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello Tadiwanashe, Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
25/01/24, 9:07 am - Keshav Edoofa: @263779468554 are you available to continue the session?
25/01/24, 10:26 am - +263 77 946 8554: Yes sir
25/01/24, 10:28 am - Keshav Edoofa: Shall i move ahead and brief you about the EWYL program!?
25/01/24, 1:22 pm - +263 77 946 8554: Yes go ahead sir
25/01/24, 1:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in
25/01/24, 1:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
25/01/24, 1:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
25/01/24, 1:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*

25/01/24, 1:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
25/01/24, 1:26 pm - +263 77 946 8554: Yeah i think so Mr
25/01/24, 1:27 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that Tadiwanashe, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
25/01/24, 2:55 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Are you available to continue? @263779468554
25/01/24, 4:16 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Tadiwanashe, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM  CAT*.

29/01/24, 9:29 am - +263 77 946 8554: Noted Mr Keshav
29/01/24, 9:29 am - +263 77 946 8554: So can i know where are your offices in Zimbabwe

29/01/24, 9:41 am - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you understood about the EWYL program in depth and understood the benefits it provides?

29/01/24, 9:43 am - Keshav Edoofa: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?

29/01/24, 9:51 am - +27 64 512 5292: How are you
29/01/24, 9:51 am - +263 77 946 8554: Noted Mr
29/01/24, 10:02 am - Keshav Edoofa: Please answer to this Tadiwanashe
29/01/24, 10:05 am - +263 77 946 8554: This is what i was looking for Mr
29/01/24, 10:09 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad Tadiwanashe
29/01/24, 10:10 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
29/01/24, 10:16 am - +27 64 512 5292: Tadiwa
29/01/24, 10:17 am - +263 77 946 8554: Yes! Sir
29/01/24, 10:17 am - Keshav Edoofa: Tadiwanashe as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
29/01/24, 10:25 am - +263 77 946 8554: $1500-2250 isn't it
29/01/24, 10:25 am - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Tadiwanashe, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
29/01/24, 10:26 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 10:26 am - Keshav Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
29/01/24, 10:27 am - +263 77 946 8554: That's really good Mr Keshav
29/01/24, 10:29 am - Keshav Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university zapplications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
29/01/24, 10:40 am - +263 77 946 8554: Yes
29/01/24, 10:40 am - Keshav Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
29/01/24, 10:41 am - Keshav Edoofa: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
29/01/24, 10:41 am - Keshav Edoofa: However Tadiwanashe, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
29/01/24, 10:48 am - +263 77 946 8554: Ok noted sir
29/01/24, 10:49 am - Keshav Edoofa: Yes Tadiwanashe and I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
29/01/24, 12:52 pm - +263 77 946 8554: Yes i understand sir, so now i just want to know where are your offices in Manicaland?
29/01/24, 12:53 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The counseling session is not yet completed Tadiwanashe, as I have already told you that I will be connecting you in due time
29/01/24, 12:54 pm - +263 77 946 8554: Ok let's proceed
29/01/24, 1:03 pm - +263 77 946 8554: Mar Keshav let's proceed with the counseling session
29/01/24, 1:12 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright then!
29/01/24, 1:12 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
29/01/24, 1:12 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 1:13 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Tadiwanashe, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
29/01/24, 1:13 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
29/01/24, 1:16 pm - +263 77 946 8554: Yes  i understood Mr,
29/01/24, 1:21 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
29/01/24, 1:21 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
29/01/24, 1:21 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

1. What is the name of the course which  you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. Through Edoofa in which country would you be pursuing his higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in that country without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program (yearly fee after Edoofa Scholarship)?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
