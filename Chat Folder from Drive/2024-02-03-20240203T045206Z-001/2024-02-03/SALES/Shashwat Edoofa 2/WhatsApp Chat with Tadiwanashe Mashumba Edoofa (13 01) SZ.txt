My family fully supports her as she is our first daughter in family of 3 girls.

Her aspiration to become an accountant post-school not only reflects ambition but also a clear sense of direction. Tadiwanashe's proficiency in business studies, accounts, and commerce is impressive, showcasing her academic prowess in essential areas. The fact that she is diligent and reluctant to part with her books, even seen as a weakness, underscores her commitment to continuous learning and excellence.
