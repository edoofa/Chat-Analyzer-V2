24/01/24, 12:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Please let me know once you have read all the information, Tariro.
24/01/24, 12:51 pm - +263 71 366 7025: I've  read the information
24/01/24, 12:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: After reading all of these fascinating facts, I'm sure you're interested in studying in India. 
So, explain to me how studying in India can help you advance in your job and how you aim to achieve your career goals as a result of your studies in India?
24/01/24, 12:57 pm - +263 71 366 7025: Since India has a number of prosperous  businessmen , it can be a home  of learning  business practically  , also having  experience  and expertise from these successful entrepreneurs
24/01/24, 1:01 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
24/01/24, 1:11 pm - +263 71 366 7025: No
24/01/24, 1:14 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Tariro! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
24/01/24, 1:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 1:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, If you perform exceptionally well during the evaluation process, you become eligible for a higher quantum of scholarship. With the exclusive Scholarship, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1200-$1800, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc!
24/01/24, 1:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
24/01/24, 1:16 pm - +263 71 366 7025: Mmm  I doubt
24/01/24, 1:16 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know what part of the fees is not affordable, please?
24/01/24, 1:31 pm - +263 71 366 7025: $2000 _ $3000
24/01/24, 1:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have read this message, please?
24/01/24, 1:39 pm - +263 71 366 7025: Sorry  I overlooked this
24/01/24, 1:40 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether this is affordable, please?
24/01/24, 1:44 pm - +263 71 366 7025: It seems expensive for them
24/01/24, 1:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether this is not affordable, please?
24/01/24, 1:46 pm - +263 71 366 7025: Yah it is not
24/01/24, 1:46 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Do you have a general idea about the cost of education in your home country, please?
24/01/24, 7:37 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Are we still connected? If you are facing any challenges, please let me know.
25/01/24, 9:10 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"Your life does not get better by chance, it gets better by change." - Jim Rohn*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
25/01/24, 10:20 am - +263 71 366 7025: Not so sure
25/01/24, 10:21 am - +263 71 366 7025: Very sorry I had exhausted the whatsapp bundle
25/01/24, 10:21 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Tariro!
25/01/24, 10:21 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Now considering that your home country is Zimbabwe. The average tuition fees of a decent university in Zimbabwe is 1200-1500$ a year which roughly means 750$ per term. On top of that the cost of food averages around 1$ per meal. Plus the miscellaneous charges including internet and accommodation are around 2000-2500$ per annum. Therefore, resulting in 3000-4000$ a year. Will you be able to afford this type of education which barely leads to employment? Many of our students who are already in India with us have mentioned that students who are studying in Zimbabwe are barely getting any jobs after completing their respective courses.

Will you be content with the fact that you are spending money and time on a degree like that?
25/01/24, 10:21 am - +263 71 366 7025: Good morning
25/01/24, 10:25 am - +263 71 366 7025: No
25/01/24, 10:40 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tariro. Our support doesn't stop there! Edoofa also offers an innovative *Earn While You Learn Program*. This program allows you to further reduce your remaining fees by gaining practical work experience while studying. It not only eases the financial burden but also provides you with valuable skills and industry exposure, enhancing your employability and ensuring a well-rounded education.

With *Edoofa's* exclusive Scholarship and the opportunity to earn while you learn, you can focus on your studies, explore your field of interest, and prepare for a successful career.

So do you want me to guide you about the *Earn while you learn* program in depth?
25/01/24, 10:46 am - +263 71 366 7025: Yes
25/01/24, 12:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect after 60 minutes for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule. 

Meanwhile, you can go through our Social Media page to learn more about the experiences of Edoofians and the program!

25/01/24, 12:26 pm - +263 71 366 7025: Okay
25/01/24, 1:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: A very pleasant afternoon to everyone. I am done with my lunch. Thank you for your patience.
25/01/24, 3:14 pm - +263 71 366 7025: You're welcome
25/01/24, 3:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tariro. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
25/01/24, 3:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
25/01/24, 3:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
25/01/24, 3:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
25/01/24, 3:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
25/01/24, 3:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for your child?
25/01/24, 7:33 pm - +263 77 356 0436: Greetings ::yess my child is going to benefit more
25/01/24, 8:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mrs. Gracious!
25/01/24, 8:19 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1600 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $400 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $40-$60 a month
25/01/24, 8:19 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
25/01/24, 8:19 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $1600, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $800 in the first semester and $800 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
25/01/24, 8:19 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

29/01/24, 9:24 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams." - Eleanor Roosevelt*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
29/01/24, 10:07 am - +263 71 366 7025: Good morning
29/01/24, 10:07 am - +263 71 366 7025: Yes I'm ready
29/01/24, 11:37 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Tariro!
29/01/24, 11:37 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have comprehended the information propagated during the previous session, please?
29/01/24, 11:38 am - +263 71 366 7025: Yes
29/01/24, 11:56 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
29/01/24, 11:56 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
29/01/24, 11:56 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
29/01/24, 12:08 pm - +263 71 366 7025: Affordability through guaranteed scholarship 
EWYL
Higher education concierge 
Employability through practical training
29/01/24, 1:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Tariro! May I know which one is your favourite, please?
29/01/24, 1:49 pm - +263 71 366 7025: Affordability through guaranteed scholarship
29/01/24, 1:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand that your emphasis is on affordability. So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
29/01/24, 1:52 pm - +263 71 366 7025: I think they are in support
29/01/24, 3:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
29/01/24, 3:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
29/01/24, 3:58 pm - +263 71 366 7025: Yes
30/01/24, 9:10 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning, Everyone! I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused by the technical difficulties my device experienced, which temporarily affected our communication. I'm pleased to inform you that the issues have been resolved. *I would be delighted to resume our sessions and propose reconnecting at 10:00 A.M. CAT*. Your continued engagement is highly appreciated, and I look forward to our fruitful and interactive sessions.
01/02/24, 9:21 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 10:33 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
01/02/24, 9:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Are we still connected? If you are facing any challenges, please do let me know.
01/02/24, 9:42 pm - +263 71 366 7025: Evening sir
 I have been  experiencing data bundles crisis
01/02/24, 9:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Tariro!
01/02/24, 9:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
01/02/24, 9:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
01/02/24, 9:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 9:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
