19/08/23, 10:18 am - Arshita: Greetings! 

*"If my mind can conceive it, if my heart can believe it, then I can achieve it."*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
19/08/23, 11:33 am - +263 78 078 2779: Yes we can
19/08/23, 11:34 am - Arshita: Greetings! 

How are you doing?
19/08/23, 11:36 am - +263 78 078 2779: I am good thanks and you
19/08/23, 11:40 am - Arshita: Good to hear that! 

I am doing well, thank you
19/08/23, 11:40 am - Arshita: Have you gone through it?
19/08/23, 11:45 am - +263 78 078 2779: Yes l have
19/08/23, 11:45 am - +263 78 078 2779: Ok thank God
19/08/23, 11:46 am - Arshita: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it. 
Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be* somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not*
19/08/23, 11:46 am - Arshita: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
19/08/23, 11:47 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
19/08/23, 11:52 am - +263 78 078 2779: Thanks for the information
19/08/23, 11:52 am - +263 78 078 2779: Oksir
19/08/23, 11:55 am - Arshita: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa , then their final university evaluation and Admission would continued. However if the student wouldn’t have met5 the necessary requirements as per the university and Edoofa , then the paid $350 will be refunded to the parent.
*Amount of credit earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the student’s first year’s annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
19/08/23, 11:55 am - Arshita: This enrollment fee includes your
 
-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat
-Visa Documentation Assistance
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
19/08/23, 11:55 am - Arshita: However Jorum, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
19/08/23, 12:02 pm - +263 78 078 2779: Ok this is noted
19/08/23, 12:02 pm - +263 78 078 2779: Ok
19/08/23, 12:02 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
19/08/23, 12:06 pm - +263 78 078 2779: 01 and 02
19/08/23, 12:07 pm - Arshita: Well Jorum
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1:Connect with a counsellor- As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
19/08/23, 12:09 pm - Arshita: *Step 5* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
19/08/23, 12:09 pm - Arshita: This registration fee($500-$750) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
19/08/23, 12:09 pm - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
19/08/23, 12:09 pm - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
19/08/23, 12:10 pm - +263 78 078 2779: Yes
19/08/23, 12:11 pm - Arshita: Have you gone through the steps?
19/08/23, 12:15 pm - +263 78 078 2779: So l have to pay registration fee to the university first right

What if l do not have an opportunity to have the visa
19/08/23, 12:15 pm - +263 78 078 2779: Yes
19/08/23, 12:30 pm - Arshita: Please note that you can apply for the visa only by using the Admissions Acceptance Letter that you receive from the University after the registration process after which the visa process begins!
19/08/23, 12:39 pm - Arshita: Alright , we have come to the end of your counselling session, now before I guide you for Step 2 which is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
*1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*
*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*
