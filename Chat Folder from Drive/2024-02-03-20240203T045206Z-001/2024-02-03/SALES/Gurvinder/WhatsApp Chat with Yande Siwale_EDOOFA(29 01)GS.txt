29/01/24, 9:47 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Yande Siwale!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
29/01/24, 9:49 am - +260 97 1160558: Sure sir
29/01/24, 9:52 am - +260 97 1160558: You are contacting the right person
29/01/24, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Yande,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Piiyush, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
29/01/24, 10:31 am - +260 97 1160558: Thank you sir
29/01/24, 11:38 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Yande, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Mphatso, is that correct?
29/01/24, 12:02 pm - +260 97 1160558: Yes it is correct
29/01/24, 12:27 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Mphatso, also do tell me whether you learnt about Mphatso’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
29/01/24, 12:30 pm - +260 97 1160558: He explained to me edoofa is a scholarship program that operates in india
29/01/24, 1:09 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you more.
29/01/24, 1:09 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
29/01/24, 1:09 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
29/01/24, 1:09 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
29/01/24, 1:09 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
29/01/24, 1:10 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 1:10 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 1:10 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
29/01/24, 1:13 pm - +260 97 1160558: Yes
29/01/24, 1:32 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Yande, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
29/01/24, 2:02 pm - +260 97 1160558: Yes
29/01/24, 2:11 pm - Gurvinder: Now Yande, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in Grade 12?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

29/01/24, 4:12 pm - Gurvinder: Yande, it's wonderful to hear about your early experiences and how they have influenced your choice to study Electronic Electric Engineering. The exposure to electric installation and mechanics in your childhood workshop has clearly left a lasting impression, shaping your career aspirations.

30/01/24, 9:06 am - Gurvinder: May I know, why didn't you opt for Pure Physics and Pure Chemistry instead of combined sciences?

My class of admission 
Was a accounts and commerce class
30/01/24, 9:27 am - Gurvinder: So may I know, why do you opt for that if you wanted to do Engineering?
30/01/24, 9:42 am - +260 97 1160558: I want to have all grounds of chances 
Because in life it is not always that you get to do what you want
30/01/24, 9:49 am - Gurvinder: Yande, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
30/01/24, 9:51 am - +260 97 1160558: I understand
30/01/24, 10:02 am - Gurvinder: So seeing the subjects you had in your Grade 12, I can offer you a course in software development, any commercial course, and the following courses in healthcare sector :
1. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics

2. Bachelor of Science in Microbiology

3. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology

4. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology

5. Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy

6.Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology

7. Bachelor of science in Biochemistry

8. Bachelor of science in Optometry
30/01/24, 10:03 am - +260 97 1160558: Then I need to research more
30/01/24, 10:11 am - Gurvinder: May I know, when will you be able to confirm the same.
30/01/24, 10:12 am - +260 97 1160558: I will do so
30/01/24, 11:27 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 10 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time.
