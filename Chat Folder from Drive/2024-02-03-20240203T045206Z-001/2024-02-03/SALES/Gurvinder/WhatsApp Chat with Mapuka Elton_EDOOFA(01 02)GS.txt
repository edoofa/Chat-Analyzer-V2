*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
01/02/24, 1:09 pm - +263 78 575 8178: Ok
01/02/24, 1:11 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Elton,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Piiyush, Head of Counselling and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
01/02/24, 1:12 pm - +263 78 575 8178: Ok. Nice meeting you Mr Gurvinder
01/02/24, 1:14 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Elton, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Jeston, is that correct?
01/02/24, 1:15 pm - +263 78 575 8178: Yess
01/02/24, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Jeston, also do tell me whether you learnt about Jeston’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
01/02/24, 1:20 pm - +263 78 575 8178: Edoofa is an organization that offers scholarships to international students who would like to study in india.The scholarships usually starts from 50%-100% which will be determined with with your academic performance. Edoofa offers assistance to both undergraduate and post graduate students.And also i am aware of jeston's journey but i might not know some of the information i think
01/02/24, 1:26 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
01/02/24, 1:26 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
01/02/24, 1:26 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
01/02/24, 1:26 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
01/02/24, 1:26 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
01/02/24, 1:30 pm - +263 78 575 8178: That is correct
01/02/24, 1:32 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Elton, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
01/02/24, 1:34 pm - +263 78 575 8178: Yes i do.
01/02/24, 1:34 pm - Gurvinder: Now Elton, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

01/02/24, 2:55 pm - Gurvinder: Please that will depend on you, that how long will you take to pass the eligibility test to be a CA.
01/02/24, 2:55 pm - +263 78 575 8178: Ok. Ok
01/02/24, 2:55 pm - Gurvinder: So did you understand the course?
01/02/24, 2:57 pm - +263 78 575 8178: Yp. Yess sure
01/02/24, 2:57 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
01/02/24, 3:06 pm - +263 78 575 8178: With assistance from Edoofa program i will be able to attend worldwide recognized schools that means if i study B.com only the degree can enable me to work at multinational companies or international banks. This alone means i will be paid thousands per year which in five years time  i would be able to start my own accounting firm which will either focus on auditing or any financial services.That means if i pursue to become a Chartered accountant i might be a well known international accountant since through Edoofa i would have equipped hands on knowledge and experience that would make it easier to compete in the world market for Chartered Accountants
01/02/24, 3:12 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Elton I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
01/02/24, 3:15 pm - +263 78 575 8178: I am fully dedicated 💯.
01/02/24, 3:15 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
01/02/24, 3:21 pm - +263 78 575 8178: Speaking Of the economic difficulties faced by Zimbabwe it is not worth it to study towards CA because you will not be paid the correct amount that suits your efforts. And also the big firms which employ CA are now filled with corruption that you might end up working under someone who studied a different degree who will end up taking your place.

However besides domestic difficulties, studying abroad opens new opportunities for someone especially when the country is more developed as compared to your current country
01/02/24, 3:22 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
01/02/24, 3:30 pm - +263 78 575 8178: Sharing ideas with school principals especially from previous schools to adopt to new way of interacting with students and also influencing other fellow students
01/02/24, 3:32 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Elton, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
01/02/24, 3:32 pm - +263 78 575 8178: I completely agree with you
01/02/24, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
01/02/24, 3:41 pm - +263 78 575 8178: Yeah
01/02/24, 3:42 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
01/02/24, 3:42 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

01/02/24, 3:49 pm - Gurvinder: So now Elton, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
01/02/24, 3:50 pm - +263 78 575 8178: How is the management industry growing in India. Especially the financial institutions
01/02/24, 3:53 pm - Gurvinder: The management industry in India, particularly in financial institutions, is experiencing growth driven by factors such as economic expansion, technological advancements, financial inclusion initiatives, and regulatory changes. The rise of FinTech, globalization, and increased demand for wealth management services contribute to the expanding opportunities for management professionals in the financial sector.
01/02/24, 3:53 pm - +263 78 575 8178: Ok.
01/02/24, 3:54 pm - +263 78 575 8178: Will i be able to work in India
01/02/24, 3:57 pm - Gurvinder: Elton in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!

You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
01/02/24, 4:00 pm - +263 78 575 8178: Ok. Is the scholarship renewal or it covers until the end of course
01/02/24, 4:01 pm - Gurvinder: Please, the Edoofa scholarship program is a part of the student's education journey until the end.
01/02/24, 4:02 pm - +263 78 575 8178: Okay.i don't have any more questions
01/02/24, 4:03 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
01/02/24, 4:04 pm - +263 78 575 8178: Yes we are. But not clearly
01/02/24, 4:06 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
01/02/24, 4:06 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
01/02/24, 4:07 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
01/02/24, 4:07 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 4:07 pm - Gurvinder: In simple words Elton what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
01/02/24, 4:09 pm - +263 78 575 8178: Ok.
01/02/24, 4:10 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
01/02/24, 4:10 pm - +263 78 575 8178: Yeah sure
01/02/24, 4:13 pm - Gurvinder: Elton, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
01/02/24, 4:15 pm - +263 78 575 8178: Ok.Approximately how much does students make from the program
01/02/24, 4:18 pm - Gurvinder: Please let me explain the program, then I will surely let you know.
01/02/24, 4:19 pm - +263 78 575 8178: Ok
01/02/24, 4:19 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

01/02/24, 4:19 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
01/02/24, 4:23 pm - +263 78 575 8178: Yeah. It comes with many benefits
01/02/24, 4:23 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Elton, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
01/02/24, 4:24 pm - +263 78 575 8178: Ok ok.
01/02/24, 4:24 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

01/02/24, 4:25 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
01/02/24, 4:27 pm - +263 78 575 8178: Yeah it poses as a helpful program. But doesn't it disturb you from school work
02/02/24, 10:23 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Go into the world and do well. But more importantly, go into the world and do good.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
