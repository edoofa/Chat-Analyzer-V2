I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.
18/01/24, 8:40 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

18/01/24, 11:43 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are in good health.

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application. Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. 

Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program

23/01/24, 1:06 pm - +263 78 660 7006: Hello, How are you? 
I hope you are doing well.
I had to take some time to myself to make a deep research on the career path I would want to pursue. I came to a realization that Data Science is a vast field with a lot of attributes to it besides some universities and colleges offering it as a Undergraduate degree whereas it is a department with its core fundementals and related skills to be a specialist in the field. My research tells me I need a strong foundation in Statistics and then along the journey you major into some related courses or programs that improve your career profile. I’m kindly requesting to get assistance into acquiring the best place for a degree in Statistics so that I further my career and ambitions from that baseline going forward. I hope to be working with you in future career advancement studies as I proceed to the masters and more qualifications. I hope you will respond soon.

My apologies for the hold and delay in making a solid decision. I’m very sorry for the confusion, I showed and I promise to work with you guys properly until the last process of this application.
23/01/24, 1:42 pm - Gurvinder: Good afternoon Welcome.
23/01/24, 1:43 pm - +263 78 660 7006: Good afternoon
23/01/24, 1:43 pm - +263 78 660 7006: How are you
23/01/24, 1:52 pm - Gurvinder: Welcome, I appreciate your sincere research about your future, but how could I move ahead with your application when you failed to comply with both of the metrics of the counselling session?
23/01/24, 2:01 pm - +263 78 660 7006: I understand there is no other way and there’s no way to my knowledge that I can make up for this. I couldn’t proceed with my application with you because I had no much research in my studies and what I wanted to pursue, no career guidance and people to assist me from my side so I had to withdraw my application and try to find out all the information I could get to have a solid background for my career path. I am sorry for not communicating and not participating as noted in the terms of this program. I hope we could continue on a fresh page and hope for you to understand that this time around I don’t have a double minded decision. 

If there’s is now way we can continue with the application, it will be a great disadvantage for me and a lesson as well.
 Hope we could start on a fresh page and proceed, pardon my manners.
23/01/24, 2:20 pm - Gurvinder: I understand, I will give you another chance at this counselling session.
23/01/24, 2:21 pm - +263 78 660 7006: Thank you very much
23/01/24, 2:21 pm - +263 78 660 7006: When do we start?
23/01/24, 2:22 pm - Gurvinder: I will contact you tomorrow at 10 AM CAT.
23/01/24, 2:23 pm - +263 78 660 7006: I will be there.
23/01/24, 10:16 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
24/01/24, 8:18 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
24/01/24, 9:09 am - +263 78 660 7006: Good morning, Everyone!
24/01/24, 9:16 am - Gurvinder: So are you available today for the session?
24/01/24, 10:20 am - +263 78 660 7006: Yes
24/01/24, 10:37 am - Gurvinder: So may I know, which course you want to go ahead with?
24/01/24, 10:37 am - +263 78 660 7006: Mathematical Statistics or Statistics
24/01/24, 10:49 am - Gurvinder: But may I know, where have you researched that doing mathematics statistics will help you help you follow your dream of becoming a Data Scientist?
24/01/24, 10:54 am - +263 78 660 7006: I read articles from UNISA, watched some youtube videos on it and I read articles from Qoura and Linkdn. The information claimed that one needs a strong background in statistics or mathematics in order to understand working with data however programming skills are required to apply the data and some other necessary skills. They did not say by studying statistics you will be set for the field just like that but it’s a core foundation
24/01/24, 11:06 am - Gurvinder: Welcome, I wanted to share an exciting pathway that can pave the way for your dreams.

24/01/24, 11:13 am - +263 78 660 7006: Which BCA program will I be doing?
24/01/24, 12:03 pm - Gurvinder: BCA is more cost-effective for a person as it is a 3-year course rather than a 4-year one and still gives you the advantage of learning programming and all the aspects of that.
24/01/24, 12:14 pm - +263 78 660 7006: That is fair.
24/01/24, 12:14 pm - +263 78 660 7006: ?
24/01/24, 12:19 pm - Gurvinder: Please BCA is the course.
24/01/24, 12:20 pm - +263 78 660 7006: Let’s proceed
24/01/24, 12:28 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
24/01/24, 12:31 pm - +263 78 660 7006: Yes
24/01/24, 12:36 pm - +263 78 660 7006: Also if you don’t mind sharing the module or syllabus outline

24/01/24, 12:40 pm - +263 78 660 7006: I read it through
24/01/24, 12:41 pm - Gurvinder: Did you understand everything?
24/01/24, 12:43 pm - +263 78 660 7006: I understood and I have questions on how will I shape my BCA studies into data science
24/01/24, 12:44 pm - Gurvinder: Please refer to this.
24/01/24, 12:45 pm - +263 78 660 7006: I get it now…
24/01/24, 12:49 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
24/01/24, 1:23 pm - +263 78 660 7006: I perceive myself as a goal oriented and self motivated individual with high ambitions about where I will be in the future. Being provided by this career option, I think I will be in a better position to build necessary programming, data analysis and data base skills that can help me build a strong foundation for my further studies into the field of Data science. In 5 years time I see myself having the best possible skills to venture into Data science as a qualified junior data scientist or data analyst, this being made possible by the opportunities I get to meet professionals in the fields of my interest all this being made possible by the Edoofa program giving me the opportunity to study with an affordable student scholarship and work while you learn program that will assist me in being able to get adequate practical skills to be industry ready after the completion of my course in BCA, however as I would much appreciate getting in the industry soon after my BCA, I’d rather advance my studies into higher education by furthering my studies  into a masters degree in Machine learning and Artificial intelligence as I think the world is moving towards complicated artificial intelligence technologies. As someone interested in working for big tech companies I’d like to believe such skills are necessary also from rearches I found out that most Data scientists have a higher educational qualification for example masters in Data Science, computer science and Artificial Intelligence. Edoofa will assist me in studying in a more economically developed country with greater exposure in the tech world of India that is I will be in a position to be a better entrepreneur in Zimbabwe and contribute to the technological industry of my country, all this being made possible by the opportunity to get expertise in India made possible for me by the Edoofa program. The opportunity to be in a foreign country will uplift my interaction and communication skills with people of different race and cultures so that I can be in a position to deliver information that can be well interpreted and received effectively in the Industry and I hope to learn some foreign laungages in the process to advance opportunities in interacting with a wider range of associates in the industry.
24/01/24, 1:31 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Welcome I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
24/01/24, 1:32 pm - +263 78 660 7006: Yes
24/01/24, 1:39 pm - +263 78 660 7006: Are you still there?
24/01/24, 1:52 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
24/01/24, 1:59 pm - +263 78 660 7006: I grew up in Zimbabwe since birth till now, so I want to explore different cultures and views of the from different places as it seems India is a center of most students interested in Computerscience, engineering and medicine. Interactions with such people can get me enough exposure and connections for further career and life goals. Zimbabwe offers good education however it is limited in resources as there are no many industries in Technology. It is shocking that most businesses and Zimbabwe here don’t even consider the roles or how helpful Data scientists are but with the experience to be part of a world where your skills and passion is recognized Im able to archive my best with greater motivation and maybe help some companies and industries recognize the worth of Data in my country
24/01/24, 2:04 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
24/01/24, 2:09 pm - +263 78 660 7006: I would want to inspire people in my country to take education as something that makes dreams come true as I’ve noticed most of my peers and school associates end up studying anything just for momey or because it’s the trendy program in the country for example everyone wants to be a doctor, engineer or work in the mines not because of the love or passion but for financial security so I want it to be clear for most of the students to realize that by following your dreams you can get career satisfaction and happiness also financial freedom through doing what you love by being a good example.
24/01/24, 2:11 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Welcome, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
24/01/24, 2:13 pm - +263 78 660 7006: That is true
24/01/24, 2:14 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
24/01/24, 2:16 pm - +263 78 660 7006: Really, India was a British colony. I wasn’t aware.
24/01/24, 2:17 pm - +263 78 660 7006: I would love to know more
24/01/24, 2:19 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
24/01/24, 2:19 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

24/01/24, 2:27 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
24/01/24, 2:29 pm - +263 78 660 7006: I’m impressed with India’s archievements❤️
24/01/24, 2:30 pm - Gurvinder: So now Welcome, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
24/01/24, 2:34 pm - +263 78 660 7006: I would want to know, if it’s possible for me to do my masters as well after my barchelor’s
24/01/24, 2:34 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, it is possible.
24/01/24, 2:37 pm - +263 78 660 7006: I’d want that but I will decide on the masters program as I know more about the field
24/01/24, 2:38 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
24/01/24, 2:38 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
24/01/24, 2:40 pm - +263 78 660 7006: We don’t have information about that?
24/01/24, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
24/01/24, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
24/01/24, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
24/01/24, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 2:42 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
24/01/24, 2:43 pm - +263 78 660 7006: This is very helpful
24/01/24, 2:44 pm - +263 78 660 7006: It’s affordable and really great
24/01/24, 2:46 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
24/01/24, 2:49 pm - +263 78 660 7006: Yes please
24/01/24, 2:52 pm - Gurvinder: Welcome, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
24/01/24, 3:01 pm - +263 78 660 7006: I read it through and understood. I do have questions on the Research part of it
24/01/24, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it.

24/01/24, 3:07 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
24/01/24, 3:21 pm - +263 78 660 7006: Self branding is quite interesting as it makes you confident about yourself and ambitions as well as a boost in self esteem. Also the advantage of getting paid and being able to finance my own education can help my mother to reduce her financial burden
24/01/24, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Welcome, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
24/01/24, 3:28 pm - +263 78 660 7006: I understand
24/01/24, 3:30 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

24/01/24, 3:31 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
24/01/24, 3:32 pm - +263 78 660 7006: I understand the helpfulness of the program
24/01/24, 3:33 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Welcome, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
24/01/24, 3:34 pm - +263 78 660 7006: Yes
24/01/24, 3:34 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
24/01/24, 3:35 pm - +263 78 660 7006: Yes they know everything, i shared with them the info i read from the EDOOFA pdf
24/01/24, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
24/01/24, 3:36 pm - +263 78 660 7006: Yes
24/01/24, 3:36 pm - Gurvinder: Welcome as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
24/01/24, 3:38 pm - +263 78 660 7006: $1500
24/01/24, 3:40 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Welcome, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
24/01/24, 3:40 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 3:44 pm - +263 78 660 7006: I’m with you, I understand
24/01/24, 3:46 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
24/01/24, 3:47 pm - +263 78 660 7006: This is great
24/01/24, 3:49 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
24/01/24, 3:49 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
24/01/24, 3:49 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
24/01/24, 3:50 pm - +263 78 660 7006: I understand
24/01/24, 4:03 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
24/01/24, 4:10 pm - +263 78 660 7006: Tell me more
24/01/24, 4:11 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 4:11 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Welcome, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
24/01/24, 4:11 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
24/01/24, 4:13 pm - +263 78 660 7006: I get the process
24/01/24, 4:13 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
24/01/24, 4:14 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
24/01/24, 4:14 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
24/01/24, 4:14 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
24/01/24, 4:16 pm - +263 78 660 7006: I have no more questions
24/01/24, 4:16 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
24/01/24, 4:16 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*

01/02/24, 9:32 am - +263 78 660 7006: What is the name of the University?
01/02/24, 9:35 am - +263 77 275 8390: Good morning I have a feeling that the differences in the names gives the differences in the programmes
01/02/24, 9:43 am - Gurvinder: While BCA (Bachelor of Computer Applications) and BCA Hons (Bachelor of Computer Applications with Honours) both have their merits, there are some potential advantages of choosing a regular BCA program over BCA Hons, especially for certain types of students and career goals:

Broader Scope:

BCA programs often cover a wider range of topics within computer applications. This can be advantageous for students who want a more generalized understanding of computer science and wish to explore various areas before specializing.
Flexibility in Electives:

Regular BCA programs may offer more flexibility in choosing elective courses. This allows students to tailor their education according to their interests, potentially exploring diverse subjects beyond the core computer science curriculum.
Time Efficiency:

BCA programs might have a shorter duration or fewer credit requirements compared to BCA Hons programs. For students who prioritize completing their undergraduate education more quickly, a regular BCA program could be a more time-efficient option.
Balanced Workload:

BCA programs typically have a balanced workload without the additional academic demands associated with an Honours program. This might be suitable for students who prefer a manageable workload and a more balanced approach to academics.
Ease of Transition:

Some students may prefer the regular BCA route if they are unsure about specializing in a particular area early in their academic journey. This allows for an easier transition to different fields or specializations if their interests evolve.
Less Intensive Research Requirements:

BCA Hons programs often include research-intensive components. For students who are not inclined towards research or who prioritize practical skills over theoretical aspects, a regular BCA program might be a more suitable choice.

I understand that this program is not a charity based scholarship program and It provides scholarships on merit to my son. Edoofa program is different from applying to the University, amount paid is for joining the program for my son to get help with Internships and career advancement opportunities earning $50 to $100USD on a monthly basis. The program leads to meaningful employment which helps my son to live a life of his dreams.
