23/01/24, 10:24 am - Gurvinder: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*Bachelor of Design [B.Des]*
23/01/24, 10:31 am - +263 78 035 0326: That's great sir, I'm interested
23/01/24, 12:10 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
23/01/24, 12:10 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
23/01/24, 2:43 pm - +263 78 035 0326: Yes I am able to do it
23/01/24, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
23/01/24, 3:15 pm - +263 78 035 0326: Ok you can go ahead sir
23/01/24, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: *Bachelor of Design [B.Des]* in Communication Design is a 4-year full time undergraduate course. The programme is divided into 8 semesters of six months each.

Graphic Design is a specialised branch of communication design, and candidates wishing to specialise in this need to start out with a degree in communication design, which would allow them to specialise in graphic design after second year.
The course is best suited for those who are interested in seeking a career in anything from marketing companies to government agencies.

Having a bachelors in communication design opens the gateway to being a graphic artist, merchandiser, creative director or website designer. One may work in industries including media, public relations, communications, education and business.

Projects in this line of work include customized web-design for various merchandisers, creating advertisements for small businesses, developing magazine layouts or graphic designing for video games among other things. Some standard skills required for the aforementioned careers include creativity, knowledge of design techniques, familiarity with various multimedia and other relevant technical skills. Any design course fundamentally caters to those creatively inclined and left-brain oriented, equipping them with the necessary skills to make a career out of essentially thinking outside the box.

*What is it about?*

The program has been designed to offer the eligible students a course that concentrates on the conceptualisation, ‘design’, and execution of an idea. It can range from an advertisement to a movie, anything at all which needs to be graphically designed, the technology and software’s associated with it. The study of the course includes subjects like typography, colour theory, and layout theory. A B.Des degree in Graphic introduces a student to the industry of graphic design, understanding its history and its future, and to the technology and equipment required to design something. It focuses on the principles of design such as balance, contrast, movement and rhythm, etc., on typography, creating images for web and print, editing images, and ultimately leadership skills required to lead a team with your idea in this industry.  

This line of design is growing relevance in contemporary times. Everything today from education to markets of all types have now gained either a secondary digital presence, or operate solely in the digital space. Not only has digitization allowed producers to find wider markets but also allowed niche producers to find consumers that fit their specific demographic. Digitisation has eliminated, in various cases, costs associated with commute and thus made web-designing and digital branding critical to commerce today. Thus graduates in graphic design definitely are fit for the current ‘virtual market’ age. In fact, they have become quite indispensable in almost all industries today.

To sustain in this field one must be equipped with exceptional analytical skills and consumer insight to cater designs to consumer sensibility as well as the client’s brand image. Their artistic ability must undoubtedly be of a high grade and they should have the computer skills to translate their art into a graphic design, with a strong sense of creativity. They must be able communicators so they can understand the client’s needs and communicate his or her vision, as well as be good at time management since in this field an employee is required to work on multiple projects at the same time.

*Career Prospects*

Bachelors of Design in Communication Design graduates may have job opportunities both in the private and the government sector due to changing nature of the economy in this digital age. Today everything is seen through a web interface, exists solely on a web interface, or expands through a web interface. Furthermore, advertising campaigns and branding have become exceedingly digitized and much more intricate in design. Thus graduates in this course have a plethora of job opportunities on offer. Manufacturing units, marketing agencies, fashion media, boutiques, hotels, etc. are examples of the various private sector enterprises that hire graphic design graduates.
Job profiles for both these sectors includes graphic designers that are concerned with the conceptualization, sketching, and creation of designs keeping in mind the needs of the clients and consumer susceptibility. Similarly Web designers are occupied with the creation of websites, and more specialized job profiles in this field include interaction designers, communications designers, service designers, and etc.

24/01/24, 9:31 am - Gurvinder: Did you understand the program?
24/01/24, 9:59 am - +263 78 035 0326: Yeah I did
24/01/24, 10:10 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
24/01/24, 11:33 am - +263 78 035 0326: You know the way I see it,since I decided to join the program in the next 5 years after the completion as for me I will become a more experienced person that I can even find myself a job to proceed with my career.I can also achieve my dreams by the help of Edoofa's programs since it provides me with the EWYL (Earn While You Learn} program which offers me with the opportunity to work while I am learning
24/01/24, 12:27 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great @263780350326 I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
24/01/24, 12:34 pm - +263 78 035 0326: Yes sir I'm willing to do it
24/01/24, 12:41 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
24/01/24, 12:52 pm - +263 78 035 0326: I would like to study abroad because I can afford better experience,so as to afford higher education as well in my course. The second reason is my friends in India too inspired me a lot and Covenant too
24/01/24, 12:55 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
24/01/24, 1:17 pm - +263 78 035 0326: Ok the way I see it, I am going to contribute my learnings by sharing people some of my experiences,ideas and skills on how this course can be done and it's advantages so as to encourage students to put more effort on studying this course
24/01/24, 1:29 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community @263780350326 , but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
24/01/24, 1:33 pm - +263 78 035 0326: I agree with you sir
24/01/24, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
24/01/24, 2:46 pm - +263 78 035 0326: Yes it is
24/01/24, 3:12 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
24/01/24, 3:13 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

24/01/24, 3:42 pm - Gurvinder: So now @263780350326, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
24/01/24, 3:43 pm - +263 78 035 0326: No nothing
24/01/24, 3:43 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
24/01/24, 3:44 pm - +263 78 035 0326: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 3:44 pm - +263 78 035 0326: No not really
24/01/24, 3:46 pm - +263 78 035 0326: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 3:47 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
24/01/24, 3:47 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
24/01/24, 3:47 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
24/01/24, 3:47 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
24/01/24, 3:47 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 3:48 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
24/01/24, 3:52 pm - +263 78 035 0326: That's a lot
24/01/24, 3:53 pm - +263 78 035 0326: That's interesting though
24/01/24, 4:06 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
24/01/24, 4:30 pm - +263 78 035 0326: Yes you can
24/01/24, 10:30 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!

29/01/24, 12:23 pm - +263 78 035 0326: Yes please
29/01/24, 12:26 pm - Gurvinder: @263780350326 , The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
29/01/24, 12:29 pm - +263 78 035 0326: That's Interesting
29/01/24, 12:31 pm - +263 78 035 0326: You may condinue
29/01/24, 1:20 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
29/01/24, 1:20 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
29/01/24, 1:20 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*

29/01/24, 1:21 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
29/01/24, 1:41 pm - +263 78 035 0326: It might be a better thing for me to become an Edoofian on such an extant that one day I will live a better life
29/01/24, 1:53 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that @263780350326 , moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
29/01/24, 2:25 pm - +263 78 035 0326: That's interesting
29/01/24, 2:37 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

29/01/24, 2:37 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
30/01/24, 6:16 am - +263 78 035 0326: Yes and I hope will make it through
30/01/24, 7:55 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“The best way to predict your future is to create it."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
30/01/24, 8:45 am - +263 78 035 0326: Ok you may proceed
30/01/24, 9:30 am - Gurvinder: Alright @263780350326, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
30/01/24, 9:34 am - +263 78 035 0326: Yes they are
30/01/24, 9:50 am - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
30/01/24, 9:51 am - +263 78 035 0326: They already know
30/01/24, 9:52 am - +263 78 035 0326: We've discussed bout it
30/01/24, 12:38 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
30/01/24, 1:51 pm - +263 78 035 0326: Yes I am
30/01/24, 1:51 pm - Gurvinder: @263780350326 as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
30/01/24, 1:53 pm - +263 78 035 0326: Ok interesting
30/01/24, 1:54 pm - Gurvinder: Please answer in figures.
30/01/24, 1:58 pm - +263 78 035 0326: $1500-$2250
30/01/24, 2:00 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly @263780350326 , and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
30/01/24, 2:00 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
30/01/24, 2:02 pm - +263 78 035 0326: So where am I going to pay this money
30/01/24, 2:03 pm - Gurvinder: Please you will be guided for that, first, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
30/01/24, 2:10 pm - +263 78 035 0326: I think that's the best way
30/01/24, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
30/01/24, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
30/01/24, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
30/01/24, 2:21 pm - +263 78 035 0326: Okay interesting
30/01/24, 2:21 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
30/01/24, 2:21 pm - +263 78 035 0326: You can send
30/01/24, 2:22 pm - +263 78 035 0326: No I'm not
30/01/24, 2:22 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
30/01/24, 2:23 pm - Gurvinder: Alright @263780350326, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
30/01/24, 2:23 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
30/01/24, 2:27 pm - +263 78 035 0326: Yes sir I did
30/01/24, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
30/01/24, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
30/01/24, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
30/01/24, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
30/01/24, 2:41 pm - +263 78 035 0326: I wanted to say can I be able to study without Advance level results
30/01/24, 2:42 pm - +263 78 035 0326: Or if I can't study am I able to find a college
30/01/24, 2:44 pm - Gurvinder: Please your session will start in 2025, until then surely you would have your results.
30/01/24, 2:44 pm - +263 78 035 0326: Ok sure
30/01/24, 2:45 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
30/01/24, 2:46 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
