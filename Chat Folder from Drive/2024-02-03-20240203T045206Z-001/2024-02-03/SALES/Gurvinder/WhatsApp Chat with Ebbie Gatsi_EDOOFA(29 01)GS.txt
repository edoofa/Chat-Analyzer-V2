29/01/24, 9:52 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Ebbie, Mr and Mrs Makusha!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
29/01/24, 11:50 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 10 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
30/01/24, 5:34 am - +27 61 130 4557: I accented your request after that you went silent
30/01/24, 7:51 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“The best way to predict your future is to create it."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
30/01/24, 11:28 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
01/02/24, 7:55 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

02/02/24, 1:54 pm - Gurvinder: Sir, why do you feel like that, as your child filled the application through our student who is already in India studying through this program?
02/02/24, 1:55 pm - +27 83 566 8447: Why you isolate people to talk to them, put everyone in 1 group and tell us what you all about, how your scholarship works
02/02/24, 1:56 pm - +27 61 130 4557: You always tell us that we missed how do we miss online session that is not scheduled

02/02/24, 1:58 pm - +27 62 196 1565: Im no longer interested
02/02/24, 1:58 pm - +27 83 566 8447: So why you put 1 family in a group instead of using 1 number and tell us the time for session
02/02/24, 1:59 pm - Gurvinder: @27835668447 this is not an isolated group, with all due respect, this is the group for Ebbie's counselling session. 

She will be counseled by Me.

Her application will be supervised by Mr Piiyush *Head of Counselling* and Mr Jyotishman *Head of Admission*
02/02/24, 1:59 pm - +27 83 566 8447: You just come up saying you missed your session which you didnt give us time and date

02/02/24, 2:03 pm - +27 83 566 8447: Will contact FBI about your scholarship
02/02/24, 2:04 pm - Gurvinder: @27835668447 because you are not interacting with an admission agent, the counselling session is supposed to be conducted in the group.
02/02/24, 2:05 pm - +27 83 566 8447: Who did you tell about this
02/02/24, 2:06 pm - Gurvinder: @27835668447 with all due respect please read the first message that I sent, the counselling session will only be scheduled if you would get back in the group
02/02/24, 2:06 pm - Gurvinder: Without that how do you expect someone to schedule the counselling session please?
02/02/24, 2:06 pm - +27 83 566 8447: Did u put him in this group or it qas only you, now you adding them after weeks of being you only
02/02/24, 2:07 pm - +27 83 566 8447: The group was only 4 of us now you add these other people you think we can listen to your stories
02/02/24, 2:08 pm - Gurvinder: @27835668447 please check the same once again, there are only 3 Participants form Edoofa about who I have briefed you in the group
