29/01/24, 9:41 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Pauseland, Mr and Mrs Tshuma!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
29/01/24, 9:47 am - +263 78 588 0702: Good morning to you too. I am Pauseland and yes you have contacted the right person.
29/01/24, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Pauseland,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
29/01/24, 10:48 am - +263 78 588 0702: Okay
29/01/24, 11:44 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Pauseland, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Sinqobile, is that correct?
29/01/24, 11:45 am - +263 78 588 0702: Yes it is correct
29/01/24, 12:05 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Sinqobile, also do tell me whether you learnt about Sinqobile’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
29/01/24, 1:11 pm - +263 78 588 0702: Okay I learnt that the Edoofa program is a scholarship program that helps meritorious students to further their studies abroad and it provides 50% or 100% scholarship depending on what the student got. There is also an earn while you learn program that compensate the students effort through paying part of the tuition fee that parents are supposed to contribute. 

I have learnt a bit about Sinqobile's journey and her experience with the Edoofa Program. So far it has been a good program that gives a student no doubts about getting help with furthering studies abroad
29/01/24, 1:31 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
29/01/24, 1:31 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
29/01/24, 1:31 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
29/01/24, 1:31 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
29/01/24, 1:31 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
29/01/24, 2:33 pm - +263 78 588 0702: Okay I clearly understand everything now
29/01/24, 2:34 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Pauseland, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
29/01/24, 2:35 pm - +263 78 588 0702: Yes it is , I really want to help my parents reduce the financial burden
29/01/24, 2:36 pm - Gurvinder: Now Pauseland, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
29/01/24, 2:38 pm - +263 78 588 0702: Yes I think l have what it takes  to meet those two significant metrics and score a higher quantum of scholarship

*Bachelor of Arts - Bachelor of Legislative Law*
30/01/24, 3:42 pm - +263 78 588 0702: Okay
30/01/24, 3:42 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
30/01/24, 3:42 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
30/01/24, 3:45 pm - +263 78 588 0702: Okay noted . I understand  and l am confident that l will achieve the maximum points
30/01/24, 3:45 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
30/01/24, 3:46 pm - +263 78 588 0702: Yes please go ahead

A course in BA LLB is an exciting one that offers multiple career opportunities. The 5 key positions associated with this course are:
*1) Legal Advisor*
The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations. The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.
*2) Lawyer*
As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law.

Their role starts once the police have investigated and filed the charge sheet in court. The expectation from the Public Prosecutor is that he acts in the interests of the general public and is fair and ethical. The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor.
*4) Judge*
This role is considered to be very prestigious by any law student. Immediately after the completion of graduation, an individual can appear for a lower judiciary exam. The age group depending on different states varies between 21 to 35 years. The qualities of righteousness, good ethics and a passion for justice are some of the key qualities needed for this job.
*5) Company Secretary*
This job is for students who want to work in the corporate sector. This job requires a degree from ICSI or the Institute of Company secretaries of India. A lot of dedication and hard work is required to complete this course with your law degree, but on successful completion, this career can be extremely rewarding.
A career in law is considered to be much sought after, satisfying and lucrative.
30/01/24, 3:56 pm - +263 78 588 0702: Okay so if l may ask a student who wants to become a judge must first complete graduation as a lawyer then start upgrading?
30/01/24, 3:56 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
30/01/24, 3:57 pm - +263 78 588 0702: Okay l now understand
30/01/24, 3:57 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?

Getting opportunity to be part of Edoofa's program can enable me to achieve my dreams as l will be given an opportunity to pursue law and make a positive impact in the world through my work as a lawyer .
I believe that in five years time after the the completion of this course I would have brought a change on unfairly served justice. I see myself as a happy , determined and  satisfied  young lawyer who would have achieved the desire of being a lawyer
30/01/24, 11:24 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

01/02/24, 7:54 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
01/02/24, 8:16 am - +263 78 588 0702: Good morning. 
Such motivating words thank you.
01/02/24, 8:51 am - Gurvinder: That is really great Pauseland I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
01/02/24, 9:28 am - +263 78 588 0702: Yes l understand and very willing to work hard and use all the opportunities coming my way
01/02/24, 9:37 am - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
01/02/24, 9:57 am - +263 78 588 0702: Okay l want to study abroad and not in my country because studying in my country has got disadvantages as job opportunities are low. Whilst getting opportunity to study abroad provides a unique and valuable experience and can give me opportunities to learn about different cultures and perspectives.  Studying abroad can open up new opportunities for my future career as it can give me a chance to network with lawyers and legal professionals from around the world. I think studying abroad will be best and can help me achieve my dream
01/02/24, 9:58 am - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
01/02/24, 10:11 am - +263 78 588 0702: To be honest l haven't planned contributing to the development of the education system in my country because my aim and wish is to study and work abroad
01/02/24, 10:12 am - Gurvinder: But still there is something you would want to do for your community, may I know what that can be?
01/02/24, 10:25 am - +263 78 588 0702: Okay l can bring back new knowledge and perspectives that can benefit the legal community in my country and l will promote the benefits of studying abroad to others and encourage them to pursue similar opportunities
01/02/24, 10:29 am - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Pauseland, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
01/02/24, 10:31 am - +263 78 588 0702: I agree
01/02/24, 10:32 am - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
01/02/24, 10:33 am - +263 78 588 0702: Yes l am wondering why you highly recommend India
01/02/24, 10:37 am - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
01/02/24, 10:37 am - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

01/02/24, 12:10 pm - +263 78 588 0702: Yes l understood..for now I don't have anything to ask
01/02/24, 12:14 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
01/02/24, 12:29 pm - +263 78 588 0702: No we are not aware or familiar with the costs of studying in India  without scholarship
01/02/24, 12:29 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
01/02/24, 12:29 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
01/02/24, 12:29 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
01/02/24, 12:29 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 12:29 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
01/02/24, 12:37 pm - +263 78 588 0702: Okay so in India the average cost of higher education ranges from 6000 to 8000 without any scholarship but with the help of Edoofa program it can come down to  $2000 per year right?
01/02/24, 12:38 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct, after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
01/02/24, 12:40 pm - +263 78 588 0702: Okay I understand
01/02/24, 12:40 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
01/02/24, 12:41 pm - +263 78 588 0702: Yes please go ahead
01/02/24, 12:42 pm - Gurvinder: Pauseland, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
01/02/24, 12:50 pm - +263 78 588 0702: Okay it is really a helpful and important program . So if a student is really working hard what is the approximate  amount that will  be reduced
01/02/24, 12:51 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

01/02/24, 12:51 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
01/02/24, 12:51 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

01/02/24, 12:51 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
01/02/24, 2:04 pm - +263 78 588 0702: Okay l see
01/02/24, 2:04 pm - +263 78 588 0702: Yes I think it  will benefit me
01/02/24, 2:07 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Pauseland, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
01/02/24, 2:59 pm - +263 78 588 0702: Okay understood
01/02/24, 2:59 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

01/02/24, 2:59 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
01/02/24, 3:07 pm - +263 78 588 0702: That's exactly what l have been looking for and this EWYL seems interesting. A dedicated and hard working student can end up independent and paying tuition fee through this
01/02/24, 3:12 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Pauseland, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
01/02/24, 4:05 pm - +263 78 588 0702: Yes
01/02/24, 4:07 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
01/02/24, 4:11 pm - +263 78 588 0702: Yes l have
02/02/24, 9:57 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Go into the world and do well. But more importantly, go into the world and do good.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
02/02/24, 10:00 am - +263 78 588 0702: Good morning to you too. Thanks
02/02/24, 10:27 am - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
02/02/24, 10:38 am - +263 78 588 0702: Yes l am ready
02/02/24, 11:08 am - Gurvinder: Pauseland as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
02/02/24, 11:11 am - +263 78 588 0702: Okay that will be 1500 to 2250
02/02/24, 11:32 am - Gurvinder: Exactly Pauseland, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
02/02/24, 11:32 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 11:34 am - +263 78 588 0702: Okay l see
02/02/24, 12:37 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
02/02/24, 12:49 pm - +263 78 588 0702: Okay so which means the student will pay $350 for all this
02/02/24, 1:02 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
02/02/24, 1:04 pm - +263 78 588 0702: Okay
02/02/24, 1:24 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
02/02/24, 1:25 pm - Gurvinder: Pauseland basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
02/02/24, 1:25 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
02/02/24, 4:48 pm - +263 78 588 0702: Okay okay l understand
02/02/24, 6:10 pm - +263 77 377 6533: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 6:10 pm - +263 77 377 6533: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 6:41 pm - +263 78 588 0702: Sorry for this, he sent it by mistake
02/02/24, 11:52 pm - Gurvinder: As tomorrow is a saturday, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 11AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
