29/01/24, 9:57 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Desire, Mr and Mrs Muhara!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
29/01/24, 1:27 pm - +263 77 732 5956: Yeah you contacted the right person thank you can we proceed
29/01/24, 1:37 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Desire,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Piiyush, Head of Counselling and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
29/01/24, 1:37 pm - +263 77 732 5956: Okay thank you sir
29/01/24, 1:40 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Desire, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Moreblessing, is that correct?
29/01/24, 1:40 pm - +263 77 732 5956: That's true
29/01/24, 1:42 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Moreblessing, also do tell me whether you learnt about Moreblessing’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
29/01/24, 1:50 pm - +263 77 732 5956: Okay she didn't tell me much she only told me that you offer scholarships to study in India and was glad to hear that since l had ambitions in advancing my education
29/01/24, 1:59 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program myself.
29/01/24, 1:59 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
29/01/24, 1:59 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
29/01/24, 1:59 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
29/01/24, 1:59 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
29/01/24, 2:04 pm - +263 77 732 5956: Okay l understand it's a good program then
29/01/24, 2:13 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Desire, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
29/01/24, 2:16 pm - +263 77 732 5956: Yes l do
29/01/24, 2:16 pm - Gurvinder: Now Desire, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

30/01/24, 9:48 am - +263 77 732 5956: Yes
30/01/24, 10:00 am - Gurvinder: So did you understand the course?
30/01/24, 10:01 am - +263 77 732 5956: Yes l did
30/01/24, 10:09 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
30/01/24, 10:29 am - +263 77 732 5956: Firstly my short term goal is to advance my education to tertiary level in an internationally recognized university this means edoofa program is crucial to me by allowing me to study in India where there are best universities which are internationally recognized. Secondly after completing my tertiary education my goal is to get a better position in the international job market which means studying in one of the best universities would earn me that position again edoofa can help me accomplish that through their support
30/01/24, 10:33 am - +263 77 732 5956: I also think after getting a good job l can be able to accomplish my long term goal of being an entrepreneur after studying commerce and the business.Lastly l think  after getting enough l can be part of the edoofa program in terms of funding so that the program can continue helping the talented but poor students like me
30/01/24, 10:46 am - +263 77 732 5956: I don't know if l explained it clear
30/01/24, 12:18 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Desire I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
30/01/24, 1:06 pm - +263 77 732 5956: Yes am really dedicated
30/01/24, 1:06 pm - +263 77 732 5956: Am sorry for late reply
30/01/24, 1:06 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
30/01/24, 1:27 pm - +263 77 732 5956: Okay thank you for asking that here in Zimbabwe there is a sort of economic meltdown most businesses are closing up and that means it will be mostly theoretical in studying business yet . l need mostly practical so l think studying in developed countries like India can help me learn practically since there are successful business people there .In fact there is a saying that the first step in becoming wise is surrounding yourself with people who are so l think studying in developed countries can help not me alone but our whole nation and the world in large in terms of economy
30/01/24, 1:28 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
30/01/24, 1:36 pm - +263 77 732 5956: Firstly if l get this opportunity and be able to get enough money l would like to assist those  who are talented but financially crippled by whatever way l can so that our country can have more creative and innovative people who can come up with new ideas of developing the country. Secondly l think building private schools and colleges can also help students in getting quality education locally because more schools means more competition hence high quality education
30/01/24, 1:38 pm - +263 77 732 5956: Additionally even before getting enough l think l can help junior students with advices in making good choices especially those interested in the economic world
30/01/24, 1:39 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Desire, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
30/01/24, 1:42 pm - +263 77 732 5956: Yeah that's true
30/01/24, 1:43 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
30/01/24, 1:45 pm - +263 77 732 5956: Exactly, that's true
30/01/24, 1:46 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
30/01/24, 1:46 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
30/01/24, 2:02 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
30/01/24, 2:03 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
30/01/24, 2:03 pm - Gurvinder: In simple words Desire what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
30/01/24, 2:06 pm - +263 77 732 5956: That's really great ...can l know more about the earn as you learn
30/01/24, 2:12 pm - Gurvinder: Desire, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
30/01/24, 2:18 pm - +263 77 732 5956: Okay l understand so students will be doing more like projects that can help reduce their bills too
30/01/24, 2:18 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
30/01/24, 2:18 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
30/01/24, 2:18 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*

30/01/24, 2:19 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
30/01/24, 2:23 pm - +263 77 732 5956: Yeah l think this will help a lot
30/01/24, 2:24 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Desire, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
30/01/24, 2:26 pm - +263 77 732 5956: Okay l understand
30/01/24, 2:26 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

30/01/24, 2:27 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
30/01/24, 2:31 pm - +263 77 732 5956: Anyway my sister had been with us in the whole process maybe she may have something to ask l think she is free to do so is she
30/01/24, 2:32 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, please ask her to share her concern.
30/01/24, 2:49 pm - +263 77 974 4422: I been listening to your discussions through  it sounds like your  program is really  good.  I just want to know if your program  also covers for  visas  and  tickets  expenses
30/01/24, 2:50 pm - Gurvinder: Please the cost of travelling to India is a one time cost that you have to bear, but I assure you that our VISA experts will be there to guide you through the whole process.
30/01/24, 3:20 pm - +263 77 974 4422: I understand
30/01/24, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Desire, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
30/01/24, 5:07 pm - +263 77 732 5956: Yes they will
30/01/24, 11:29 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
31/01/24, 10:33 am - +263 77 732 5956: Morning everyone
31/01/24, 2:10 pm - +263 77 732 5956: Hello
01/02/24, 7:55 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
01/02/24, 10:29 am - +263 77 732 5956: Yae that's true we can continue
01/02/24, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
01/02/24, 10:32 am - +263 77 732 5956: Yes
01/02/24, 10:38 am - Gurvinder: Desire as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
01/02/24, 10:41 am - +263 77 732 5956: About 1500 -2500
01/02/24, 11:41 am - Gurvinder: Exactly Desire, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
01/02/24, 11:42 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 11:46 am - +263 77 732 5956: Okay l understand
01/02/24, 12:00 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
01/02/24, 2:31 pm - +263 77 732 5956: Yes that's true
01/02/24, 2:31 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
01/02/24, 2:31 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
01/02/24, 2:31 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
01/02/24, 2:33 pm - +263 77 732 5956: Okay
01/02/24, 2:34 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
01/02/24, 4:49 pm - +263 77 732 5956: No
01/02/24, 4:52 pm - +263 77 732 5956: How does it goes
02/02/24, 9:58 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Go into the world and do well. But more importantly, go into the world and do good.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
02/02/24, 1:26 pm - +263 77 732 5956: Good afternoon everyone
02/02/24, 1:28 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 1:28 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Desire, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
02/02/24, 1:28 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
02/02/24, 1:38 pm - +263 77 732 5956: Okay it's understandable
02/02/24, 1:45 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
02/02/24, 1:45 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
02/02/24, 1:46 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
02/02/24, 1:46 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
02/02/24, 1:48 pm - +263 77 732 5956: So l have to process my visa alone or it's part of the scholarship
02/02/24, 1:54 pm - Gurvinder: Please, our Visa Experts will be there to guide you though the whole process.
02/02/24, 1:55 pm - +263 77 732 5956: OkY
02/02/24, 1:59 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
02/02/24, 1:59 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
02/02/24, 1:59 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application.
02/02/24, 2:02 pm - +263 77 732 5956: Okay so first step is over right
02/02/24, 2:04 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct.
02/02/24, 2:05 pm - +263 77 732 5956: So for now l have to explain everything to my parents in preparation for the next step
02/02/24, 2:06 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
