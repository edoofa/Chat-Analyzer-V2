I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa

Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
10/01/24, 9:15 am - +260 96 7060194: Good morning 🙏
10/01/24, 9:17 am - +260 96 7060194: Well
From what I know I was a program put in place to help people aspire and get better opportunities of learning and also to reach out to people
10/01/24, 9:57 am - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
10/01/24, 9:57 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
10/01/24, 9:57 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
10/01/24, 9:58 am - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
10/01/24, 9:58 am - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
10/01/24, 9:58 am - Gurvinder: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia*

10/01/24, 9:58 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 10:01 am - +260 96 7060194: Thank you so much for the information I appreciate so much
10/01/24, 10:12 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
10/01/24, 10:13 am - +260 96 7060194: Yes I am
10/01/24, 10:22 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Ketty, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
10/01/24, 10:24 am - +260 96 7060194: Yes I do
10/01/24, 11:10 am - Gurvinder: Now Ketty, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

11/01/24, 11:29 am - Gurvinder: That is really great Ketty I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
11/01/24, 11:29 am - +260 96 7060194: Yes I am willing to do that and more if I have to work even harder than that
11/01/24, 12:45 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
11/01/24, 12:48 pm - +260 96 7060194: To be honest 
My country has a good education system  
But I would like to explore the best opportunities I can get, and my country is not too far ahead in the world of technology it is only new here in Zambia  and I've always wanted to see the world outside my country not just from a computer screen
11/01/24, 1:29 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
11/01/24, 1:37 pm - +260 96 7060194: I would just like to upgrade the technology on a wider scale because to help build and reach put to people both with high ranking and of low I would have to participate in programs and show people the good side of it all
11/01/24, 1:40 pm - +260 96 5133048: 👏👏👏
11/01/24, 1:54 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Ketty, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
11/01/24, 2:06 pm - +260 96 7060194: Yes I do
11/01/24, 2:32 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
11/01/24, 2:35 pm - +260 96 7060194: Yes I do remember from the history I took in junior secondary
11/01/24, 2:35 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
11/01/24, 2:36 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

11/01/24, 2:40 pm - +260 96 7060194: To be honest I hope with  the help of the Edoofa program I wish to be one of the people to have such an impact
11/01/24, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: So now Ketty, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
11/01/24, 2:43 pm - +260 96 7060194: No from everything you have shown I have no further questions thank you
11/01/24, 2:44 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
11/01/24, 2:45 pm - +260 96 7060194: Yes I believe we are
11/01/24, 2:46 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
11/01/24, 2:46 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
11/01/24, 2:46 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
11/01/24, 2:46 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 2:46 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
11/01/24, 2:48 pm - +260 96 7060194: Thank you so much for the information
11/01/24, 2:48 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
11/01/24, 2:48 pm - +260 96 7060194: Yes please
11/01/24, 2:52 pm - Gurvinder: Ketty, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
11/01/24, 2:54 pm - +260 96 7060194: Okay thank you I understand
11/01/24, 2:55 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

11/01/24, 2:55 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
11/01/24, 2:57 pm - +260 96 7060194: I think and know the Edoofa program will really benefit me and help me become a bit .ore independent, really
11/01/24, 2:58 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Ketty, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
11/01/24, 3:00 pm - +260 96 7060194: Okay I understand so it all just more like comes with hard work at the end of it all right
11/01/24, 3:01 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
11/01/24, 3:01 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

11/01/24, 3:01 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
11/01/24, 3:04 pm - +260 96 7060194: Yes it is just the thing I am looking forward to
11/01/24, 3:07 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Ketty, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
11/01/24, 3:08 pm - +260 96 7060194: Yes they would be
11/01/24, 3:09 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
11/01/24, 3:11 pm - +260 96 7060194: Not to the depth, but I did talk to my mother and father about it
11/01/24, 3:11 pm - +260 96 7060194: Just the scholarship part
11/01/24, 3:13 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
11/01/24, 3:15 pm - +260 96 7060194: Yes
11/01/24, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: Ketty as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
11/01/24, 3:21 pm - +260 96 7060194: They would be spending about $1500-$2250
11/01/24, 3:21 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Ketty, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
11/01/24, 3:21 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 3:22 pm - +260 96 7060194: Okay I see
11/01/24, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
11/01/24, 3:26 pm - +260 96 7060194: I think it's really smart thinking and great
11/01/24, 3:26 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
11/01/24, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).


Phase 3: Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.


The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.

However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
11/01/24, 3:29 pm - +260 96 7060194: Okay I understand
11/01/24, 3:29 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
11/01/24, 3:29 pm - +260 96 7060194: No
11/01/24, 3:30 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Ketty, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zambia itself.
11/01/24, 3:30 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
11/01/24, 3:31 pm - +260 96 7060194: I do
11/01/24, 3:32 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
11/01/24, 3:32 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
11/01/24, 3:32 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
11/01/24, 3:33 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
11/01/24, 3:35 pm - +260 96 7060194: I don't have anything to ask the questions. It would be up to my parents now if they have any, really, as for me, I'm clear with everything
11/01/24, 3:36 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
11/01/24, 3:36 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
11/01/24, 3:36 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

*“You don't have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
13/01/24, 8:23 am - +260 97 9164462: Good morning
13/01/24, 8:41 am - Gurvinder: So did you manage to have a discussion with Katty?
13/01/24, 8:41 am - +260 97 9164462: Yes
13/01/24, 8:58 am - Gurvinder: So are there any questions that you or your family would like to ask regarding the program details?
13/01/24, 9:18 am - +260 97 9164462: I think I would like to know,what percent of scholarship you are giving?
13/01/24, 9:18 am - +260 97 9164462: And what it covers and for how long during the study?
13/01/24, 9:37 am - Gurvinder: Please we offer 50%-100% scholarship, generally, the cost of education comes down to $2000-3000 per year, after that we give the student a chance to reduce the cost more through the EWYL program.
13/01/24, 9:42 am - +260 97 9164462: Kindly explain more about EWYL ?
13/01/24, 9:58 am - Gurvinder: Mrs Joshua, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
13/01/24, 9:58 am - Gurvinder: If I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
13/01/24, 10:11 am - +260 97 9164462: What is your eligibility criteria?
13/01/24, 10:35 am - Gurvinder: Please eligibility depends on the test and the interview, which will happen in this session.
13/01/24, 11:29 am - +260 97 9164462: So her final examination results will not matter?
13/01/24, 11:59 am - Gurvinder: As per the eligibility criteria,  In order to help the students get a quality education and a good quantum of  scholarship, Students should clear the following aspects:

1. I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria, in order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 4 Grade 12 passes.

2. Students should manage to clear our in-house scholarship test and interview process with an overall aggregate of 80% and above.

In case a student has a grade greater than or equal to 6 Grade Description: Satisfactory, then we do consider special recommendations by the School Heads taking into consideration other Extra-Curricular or Sports activities.
13/01/24, 11:59 am - Gurvinder: This is pre-informed to the student, Mrs Joshua.
13/01/24, 12:00 pm - +260 97 9164462: Oh okay
13/01/24, 12:00 pm - +260 97 9164462: Thank you so much
Last and not the least What is the name of your school and perhaps your website?
13/01/24, 12:16 pm - Gurvinder: Please we are not a school, our organisation is affiliated with all the globally recognized Universities in India, you can look up at our website at https://www.edoofa.com/.
13/01/24, 12:45 pm - +260 97 9164462: Okay
13/01/24, 12:46 pm - +260 97 9164462: Are they any payments that need to be made once the scholarship is giveñ?
13/01/24, 12:49 pm - Gurvinder: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 9:30 AM. Please be online during your session time!

In the meantime please go through the links I am sharing for a better understanding of the program

15/01/24, 10:00 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.
15/01/24, 10:02 pm - +260 96 7060194: Okay sir

15/01/24, 11:34 pm - +260 96 5133048: Good evening sir.

22/01/24, 7:55 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
22/01/24, 8:05 am - +260 97 9164462: Sometimes we get these details mixed up and that's why we keep asking questions sir
22/01/24, 8:07 am - +260 97 9164462: And i feel it's only fair that you explain clearly to us when need arises,
22/01/24, 8:08 am - +260 97 9164462: This is a complex issue as it is a beyond borders program and you saying this is making us uncomfortable to ask further questions
22/01/24, 8:10 am - +260 97 9164462: Be willing to answer and clarify on a few things as we need your answers to make a good decision
22/01/24, 8:11 am - +260 97 9164462: I for myself do not really understand upto now how you are enrolling without final results (makes me question your credibility and how easy it will be to get a job after)
22/01/24, 8:47 am - Gurvinder: Please, I am here to clarify all the things that a student needs to ask but before scheduling you for the interview, I counselled Ketty and informed her about everything and after that I clarified the same with you here, that is why I asked if there are any aspects that you did not get clarity of.
22/01/24, 10:41 am - Gurvinder: So as of now would you like to ask anything from the same please?
23/01/24, 12:00 am - Gurvinder: @260979164462, I was expecting your response in the session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 10 am CAT*.
23/01/24, 8:56 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
23/01/24, 8:59 am - +260 97 9164462: Just the question about admission without results
23/01/24, 9:18 am - Gurvinder: Please, we reserve the seat for the student in the University based on the previous results as the more the student waits the less scholarship seats are available in the Universities which reduced their chances of getting an acceptance letter in more Universities, doing so this soon gives them an option to start their EWYL program also gives them a chance to earn scholarship credits, and if we assume that a student earns $100 per month, then a student would already have $600 in scholarship credits for their tuition fees.
23/01/24, 10:45 am - +260 96 5133048: Good morning everyone .
Sorry for not being active because I have been very busy with school too.
Hope everyone is okay
23/01/24, 10:57 am - +260 97 9164462: We are doing well
23/01/24, 10:57 am - +260 97 9164462: Thank you
23/01/24, 10:57 am - +260 97 9164462: Thank you for the response
23/01/24, 10:57 am - +260 97 9164462: I'm clear now
23/01/24, 12:01 pm - Gurvinder: Alright @260979164462, since you must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zambia

Which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
23/01/24, 12:08 pm - +260 97 9164462: I will leave that gor the parents to answer..
But what is the name of your Associates account in Zambia?
23/01/24, 12:47 pm - Gurvinder: Can you please ask the same to the parents?
23/01/24, 12:51 pm - Gurvinder: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $35 to $50 which is quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zambia itself. Due to this not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $35 to $50 just as transfer charge. 

The second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in our associate Mr. Hammond and Mrs. Penelope's organization Penmal Connect's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 10% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Penmal Connect's account as you see he is our Associate in Zambia, His contribution has been immense because of which students like Muchimba are able to pursue their education in India.
23/01/24, 12:53 pm - Gurvinder: The fee payment can also be made through them. Since they have two accounts one is a USD account and the other is the Zambian Kwacha Account, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $385 ($350 + $35 transfer charges) or equivalent Zambian Kwacha, and the same details are as below:-

*US Dollar Account*
Bank Name: FNB
Branch: Acacia Branch
Account Name: Penmal Connect Ltd
Account Number: 62878003806
