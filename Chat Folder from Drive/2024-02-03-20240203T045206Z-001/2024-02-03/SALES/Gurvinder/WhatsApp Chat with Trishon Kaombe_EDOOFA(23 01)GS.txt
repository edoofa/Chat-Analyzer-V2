*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
23/01/24, 9:04 am - +263 77 803 8040: A good morning Mr. Gurvinder. Yes you have contacted the right persons. We are Trishon's parents and be free to ask any questions or to shade more light on the scholarship.
23/01/24, 9:23 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Mr Kaombe,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
23/01/24, 9:57 am - +263 77 803 8040: Thank you. Noted
23/01/24, 10:12 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Mr Kaombe, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Eleanor, is that correct?
23/01/24, 10:20 am - +263 77 803 8040: Very correct Mr. Gurvinder. I need to understand better.
23/01/24, 10:37 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Eleanor, also do tell me whether you learnt about Eleanor’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
23/01/24, 11:04 am - +263 77 803 8040: We haven't learnt anything yet. We are new to the program. We would want to learn more.
23/01/24, 12:03 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program.
23/01/24, 12:03 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
23/01/24, 12:03 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
23/01/24, 12:03 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
23/01/24, 12:03 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
23/01/24, 12:15 pm - +263 77 537 8218: yes sir
23/01/24, 12:48 pm - +263 77 537 8218: we would also want to know programs offered by the scholarship for a student who have been doing sciences with a combination of MATHS PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY
23/01/24, 1:28 pm - Gurvinder: Please let us be patient, as this is a counselling session, you will be guided for everything.
23/01/24, 1:53 pm - +263 77 537 8218: okay noted
23/01/24, 2:00 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Mr and Mrs Kaombe, as we start your son's counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship? <This message was edited>
23/01/24, 2:03 pm - +263 77 537 8218: yes we do
23/01/24, 2:21 pm - Gurvinder: Now Mrs Dokora, I would like to know Trishon better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about her, her career aspiration do include sharing about:-

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way <This message was edited>

Us parrents will be supporting him financially for his higher education abroad

He works under Muzarabani district local authority
23/01/24, 3:02 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, in which level are the siblings in?
23/01/24, 3:06 pm - +263 77 537 8218: she is doing her form 4 ordinary level education this year
23/01/24, 3:09 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, so do you think she would also like to be part of this program?
23/01/24, 3:15 pm - +263 77 537 8218: yes l think
23/01/24, 3:16 pm - Gurvinder: As you know the evaluation of your application begins in this counseling session, followed by the eligibility check by our Academic Board. We make sure the opportunity is provided to deserving students who are well inclined to their career paths. Therefore our Academic Board would also take the remarks on your academics and extracurriculars from your school, required in the process
23/01/24, 3:16 pm - Gurvinder: Can you please share the name and contact of your School Headmaster/Head Mistress to receive feedback regarding the same?
23/01/24, 3:21 pm - +263 77 537 8218: Madam Kajau.vcf (file attached)

23/01/24, 3:23 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
23/01/24, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during Trshon's introduction you mentioned he would like to study Phamarcy, could you please share what motivates him behind this field of study?
23/01/24, 3:49 pm - +263 77 537 8218: Trishon had a passion in pharmacy because he would want to open his phamarcy shops as they are few in our country, especially in our town . There is only one pharmacy shop in our town which can cannot provide for the whole town ,l therefore need to curb this problem.

The other motive is that Pharmacists  on our local hospital are being offered better job opportunities by other big hospitals so they are always vacancies on these small scale hospitals or even bigger ones because of few pharmacists in the country. 
l therefore need this opportunity to study pharmacy because it offers greater employment opportunities too besides being a pharmacy entrepreneur
23/01/24, 10:29 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!

24/01/24, 10:32 am - Gurvinder: Trishon's motivations for studying pharmacy. His passion for addressing the lack of pharmacies in your town and the consequent healthcare gap is admirable. By aspiring to open his own pharmacy, Trishon aims not only to fill a local need but also to contribute to the overall well-being of the community.
24/01/24, 10:32 am - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
24/01/24, 11:08 am - +263 77 537 8218: from my family members and even my some of community members none have pursued a career in this field , l think lack of requirements such as educational degree in pharmarcy being the main cause <This message was edited>

24/01/24, 1:00 pm - +263 77 537 8218: yes
24/01/24, 1:05 pm - Gurvinder: *Bachelor of Pharmacy(B.Pharm.)* is a 4 year undergraduate program which is compulsory for anyone who wants to practice as a pharmacist. B. Pharmacy is study of preparing and conferring drugs and medicines for a number of illnesses and deficiencies.

24/01/24, 1:12 pm - +263 77 537 8218: ok understood
24/01/24, 1:21 pm - Gurvinder: So did you understand the course?
24/01/24, 1:29 pm - +263 77 537 8218: yes sir
24/01/24, 1:40 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
24/01/24, 1:52 pm - +263 77 537 8218: yes
24/01/24, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
24/01/24, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

24/01/24, 2:21 pm - +263 77 537 8218: okay following
24/01/24, 2:22 pm - Gurvinder: So now Tsitsi, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
24/01/24, 2:24 pm - +263 77 537 8218: l have understand
24/01/24, 2:25 pm - +263 77 537 8218: l have no question so far
24/01/24, 2:27 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
24/01/24, 2:31 pm - +263 77 537 8218: no we are not familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship
24/01/24, 2:32 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
24/01/24, 2:32 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
24/01/24, 2:32 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
24/01/24, 2:32 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 2:33 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year, but as some courses are niche in nature like **Bachelor of Pharmacy(B.Pharm.)** itself is a course which has fewer scholarship seats, which is why for you the Annual fee after the scholarship would be between *$2700-$3700*. This cost includes:
	1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
	2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
	3. Food
	4. Accommodation
*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
24/01/24, 2:37 pm - +263 77 537 8218: ok l understand.. the scholarship makes it easy for us foreigners to study abroad
24/01/24, 2:38 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
24/01/24, 2:38 pm - +263 77 537 8218: yes you can
24/01/24, 2:39 pm - Gurvinder: Tsitsi, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
24/01/24, 2:45 pm - +263 77 537 8218: okay l understand  ..how will l can l be a member or the EWYL program sir
24/01/24, 2:49 pm - Gurvinder: Please after enrolling with the Edoofa program, you are automatically enrolled with the EWYL program.
24/01/24, 2:50 pm - +263 77 537 8218: okay
24/01/24, 2:53 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

24/01/24, 2:53 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
24/01/24, 2:58 pm - +263 77 537 8218: yes l do think so
24/01/24, 3:04 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Tsitsi, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
24/01/24, 3:06 pm - +263 77 537 8218: okay l understand
24/01/24, 3:11 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

24/01/24, 3:11 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
24/01/24, 3:15 pm - +263 77 537 8218: yes you're  different 


thats exactly what we have been looking for
24/01/24, 3:17 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Mr Dokora, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
24/01/24, 3:19 pm - +263 77 537 8218: yes my family members will be supporting for my higher education
24/01/24, 3:19 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
24/01/24, 3:21 pm - +263 77 537 8218: we haven't discussed about it yet
24/01/24, 3:21 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
24/01/24, 3:22 pm - +263 77 537 8218: yes sir
24/01/24, 3:25 pm - Gurvinder: Mrs Dakora as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
24/01/24, 3:31 pm - +263 77 537 8218: the student will be  spending about $1500 to $ 2250
24/01/24, 3:32 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Mrs Dokora, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
24/01/24, 3:32 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 3:36 pm - +263 77 537 8218: the program is really helpful in making the fee affordable to us
we greatly appreciate that
24/01/24, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
24/01/24, 3:38 pm - +263 77 537 8218: yes l do think so
24/01/24, 3:38 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
24/01/24, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: Mrs Dokora basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
24/01/24, 3:39 pm - +263 77 537 8218: okay
24/01/24, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
24/01/24, 3:44 pm - +263 77 537 8218: okay l understand ,  but in this situation the A level results  are out already even competing phase 2 l dont know how it will be resolved or the phase will be skipped if  it is possible
24/01/24, 3:46 pm - Gurvinder: Please don't worry as your EWYL program will still start.
24/01/24, 3:48 pm - +263 77 537 8218: okay
24/01/24, 3:49 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
24/01/24, 3:50 pm - +263 77 537 8218: no
24/01/24, 4:01 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 4:02 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Mrs Dokora, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
24/01/24, 4:02 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
24/01/24, 4:06 pm - +263 77 537 8218: yes l do
24/01/24, 4:07 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
24/01/24, 4:07 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
24/01/24, 4:07 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
24/01/24, 4:07 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
24/01/24, 4:14 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
24/01/24, 4:16 pm - +263 77 537 8218: no l hv understood everything soo far
24/01/24, 4:17 pm - +263 77 537 8218: yes sir there was a short network challenge
24/01/24, 4:17 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
24/01/24, 4:17 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
24/01/24, 4:17 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.
