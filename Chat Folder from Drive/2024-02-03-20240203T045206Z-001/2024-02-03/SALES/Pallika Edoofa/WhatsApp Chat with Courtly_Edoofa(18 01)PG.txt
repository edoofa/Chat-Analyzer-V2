18/01/24, 4:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
18/01/24, 4:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
18/01/24, 4:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also,As your evaluation progresses, I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
18/01/24, 4:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/01/24, 6:24 pm - +263 71 719 7155: Not yet Edoofa is my first
19/01/24, 4:52 am - +263 71 719 7155: Good morning , so today I go to school and come back at 5 I don't know if your office hours will still be available
19/01/24, 9:32 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

*"If you can dream it, you can do it."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
19/01/24, 11:08 am - +27 84 416 1241: Greetings, 

Courtly has gone to school so I don't know if we can do the session without her
19/01/24, 11:09 am - +27 84 416 1241: And she will only be free after 5pm  and tomorrow

20/01/24, 12:36 pm - +263 77 698 4235: I am doing chemistry because l thought its in the same category
20/01/24, 12:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
20/01/24, 12:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
20/01/24, 12:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since you do not have Physics, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine and Pharmacy, but considering your interest there are better courses from the Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help fulfill your dreams of working in this field

23/01/24, 11:28 am - Pallika Edoofa: I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you will be intrigued for Courtly to study in India
23/01/24, 11:43 am - +27 84 416 1241: If she wishes to, then i will definitely encourage her to do so
23/01/24, 11:56 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, *By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
23/01/24, 12:12 pm - +27 84 416 1241: I can say no because i haven't done any reseaches for now. If you have an idea please share with me
23/01/24, 12:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

23/01/24, 12:56 pm - +27 84 416 1241: With the cost of living here in Africa i won't manage any of these international universities but to your reduced cost I'm so glad to know that my child can be able to fulfil her dreams
23/01/24, 12:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
23/01/24, 1:08 pm - +27 84 416 1241: Please explain
23/01/24, 1:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
23/01/24, 1:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
23/01/24, 1:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
23/01/24, 4:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 9:38 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good afternoon Courlty and Dear Parents,
I hope that this message finds you well today.

Shall we continue our discussion, please?
24/01/24, 9:40 am - +27 84 416 1241: Good morning. Hope I find you well.
24/01/24, 9:42 am - +27 84 416 1241: Sorry that i got busy at work yesterday. I would like to say this is such a great idea not only the students benefit but they can also learn to be responsible for themselves while learning.
24/01/24, 10:17 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright!
24/01/24, 10:17 am - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!
24/01/24, 10:17 am - Pallika Edoofa: Also, If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.

24/01/24, 12:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Kindly excuse for the delay my network is acting up today.
24/01/24, 12:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
24/01/24, 1:04 pm - +27 84 416 1241: Higher Education Concierge is one of the facts I feel is significant.
24/01/24, 1:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education, services and guidance
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

24/01/24, 1:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
24/01/24, 1:22 pm - +27 84 416 1241: Like i have said from the beginning,  we as both parents working so hard to provide for her so with the help of Edoofa Program we would be able to help with the remaining part of the fees.
24/01/24, 1:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I appreciate that, Also,  I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how you feel about your child studying abroad?
24/01/24, 1:50 pm - +27 84 416 1241: I feel so great because that's what she wishes and she will have to experience a lot of things and she will have an opportunity to explore the world.

May I kindly ask. What is your benefit in this program
24/01/24, 2:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Honestly Ms. Ever, I am really happy that you asked this question, a lot of times parents do have such a question in their mind but they refrain from sharing thinking it might not be right to ask such question. Now that you have asked let me help you understand how Edoofa really benefits. 

You see, Edoofa scholarship program is not just an admission opportunity, unlike typical admission agents who ask for money upfront against admission, for an agent the responsibility ends the moment they provide a student with an admission. 

However in Edoofa's scenario, Edoofa's process begins when a student takes admission into the program. You see our success is dependent on our student's success. In the first cohort Edoofa only had 50 scholarship seats back in 2017, today for August 2024 and August 2025 intake Edoofa has over 5000+ Scholarship seats that is 100X growth in last 7 years. This is actually Edoofa's success.

We're different because our success comes from yours. Our joy is in seeing your child succeed, making you a proud parent in both your community and ours. Our main goal is to guide students toward success and be part of their journey to achievement.

Tomorrow if your child becomes successful in life and has a good paying job in India itself, wouldn't you as a proud parent recommend people around you to study through Edoofa Scholarship Program?
24/01/24, 2:52 pm - +27 84 416 1241: Alright that is good. If i may ask again. Upon completing of their studies ,will the students be able to find jobs in the countries of there choices or they will be working in India and Africa only. Are these degrees recognised nationwide?
24/01/24, 3:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely! Ms. Ever, By studying in India, students receive top-notch education and training, making them eligible to work anywhere in the world upon completing their studies. The degrees earned are recognized nationwide, and students have the opportunity to explore job prospects globally, not limited to India and Africa.
24/01/24, 3:51 pm - +27 84 416 1241: Well that's great. I now I can be able to share with other people what Edoofa is all about. Thank you very much
24/01/24, 4:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 9:57 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greeting Everyone,
How are you all doing today?
25/01/24, 10:03 am - +27 84 416 1241: Morning everyone. Hope I find you well
25/01/24, 10:33 am - Pallika Edoofa: I am doing well, Thank you for asking, dear!
25/01/24, 10:34 am - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Ever, Continuing the description, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
25/01/24, 10:45 am - +27 84 416 1241: I'm sure we talked about this yesterday
25/01/24, 11:15 am - Pallika Edoofa: Oh, Kindly excuse that Ms. Ever as it might be a technical error!
25/01/24, 11:16 am - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Ever, It's wonderful to hear that you're feeling excited and optimistic about the journey ahead! Embracing new experiences and opportunities to explore the world will undoubtedly enrich your personal and professional growth. Remember, each experience, whether challenging or rewarding, will shape you in unique ways, preparing you for the adventures that lie ahead.
25/01/24, 11:16 am - Pallika Edoofa: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
25/01/24, 11:33 am - +27 84 416 1241: Well I'm not sure can you please elaborate on the requirements
25/01/24, 11:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
25/01/24, 11:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
25/01/24, 11:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/01/24, 9:31 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 9:47 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings to you all,
As scheduled, I am here to continue your sessions and evaluate your application.
29/01/24, 9:50 am - +27 84 416 1241: Greetings to you too. 

We are ready
29/01/24, 10:05 am - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!
29/01/24, 10:05 am - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Ever, I hope that you had a great weekend!
29/01/24, 10:05 am - Pallika Edoofa: So, ending the session, Let me discuss that *why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
29/01/24, 10:06 am - Pallika Edoofa: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.

The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
29/01/24, 10:06 am - Pallika Edoofa: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
29/01/24, 10:06 am - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
29/01/24, 10:34 am - +27 84 416 1241: Alright. How will the phase two happen while still studying here. Please explain can you explain further
29/01/24, 10:40 am - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, please!
29/01/24, 10:40 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 11:01 am - +27 84 416 1241: We have fully discussed stage 1
29/01/24, 11:05 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's right!!!
29/01/24, 11:05 am - Pallika Edoofa: Well, Ms. Ever,
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you?
29/01/24, 11:08 am - +27 84 416 1241: Yes please you can go ahead
29/01/24, 11:09 am - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
29/01/24, 11:09 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
29/01/24, 11:09 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6 :* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
29/01/24, 11:23 am - +27 84 416 1241: So far so good
29/01/24, 11:24 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that you are clear with now!
29/01/24, 11:26 am - +27 84 416 1241: So here does it mean if you fail to pay registration within 7 days you will no longer be eligible?
29/01/24, 11:34 am - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Ever, Please note that once your child is found eligible after the eligibility check test and the interview you will be given a time of 7 days to pay the enrollment fees after getting the acceptance letter and you can either pay *$350 in 7 days* or *part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
29/01/24, 11:48 am - +27 84 416 1241: Alright noted
29/01/24, 11:48 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Do you have any questions for me now?
29/01/24, 11:54 am - +27 84 416 1241: Yes please don't get offended just want to know. Why registration paying registration fee before the A level results are out although you have mentioned it's for place reservation, I'm still wondering why it should be paid
29/01/24, 11:56 am - Pallika Edoofa: Please note Ms. Ever, a student only pays the enrollment fee if they are found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, because if they are found eligible then they would have a guarantee of admission under the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
29/01/24, 12:07 pm - +27 84 416 1241: Well that I am sure that is where most of us parents fail because that admission fee has a due time. Say my child has been found eligible today, i will not manage it today as i will be focusing on her current study fees
29/01/24, 12:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Ever, There are two important reasons why the 2025 intake has been open now!

1) Zimbabwean students receive the results very late compared to other African Nations. The WAEC results of Ghana, Nigeria and other Western African Nations are declared mid-year. Malawians receive around the same time, Zambians receive the results much earlier compared to Zimbabwe, and students from other nations will be occupying the majority of the scholarship seats. This is the reason, we evaluate the O level and term results, interests and passion, career goals, extracurriculars, achievements, roles of responsibilities etc to evaluate the form 5 students for the Edoofa scholarship program. We also give the opportunity to parents to take part in the sessions on behalf of applicants so that deserving applicants do not miss the golden opportunity.
29/01/24, 12:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, Early financial planning for tertiary education is crucial for parents for several reasons:

*Cost of Education:* Tertiary education, including college or university, can be expensive. Tuition fees, books, accommodation, and other associated costs can add up significantly. Planning allows parents to save and budget for these expenses, reducing the financial burden when the time comes.

*Time Horizon:* Tertiary education typically takes several years to complete. By starting to save early, parents have a longer time horizon to accumulate the necessary funds.

*Financial Stability:* By planning early, parents can avoid financial stress and debt. Without proper planning, they may have to rely on loans or other high-cost financing options, which can lead to long-term financial challenges. SAVE YOURSELF FROM LOANS

*INTERNSHIPS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK:* Early planning can also involve students participating in projects that will be offered by the EWYL Department of Edoofa after Induction which can help offset the cost of education. These opportunities often have application deadlines, so planning allows parents to take advantage of them.

*Teach Financial Responsibility:* Involving children in the financial planning process can teach them valuable lessons about money management, savings, and responsibility. It helps instill good financial habits from an early age.

*Avoiding Last-Minute Rush:* Delaying financial planning until the last minute can lead to rushed decisions and inadequate savings. Early planning provides a more thoughtful and organized approach.

*Goal Setting:* Setting specific financial goals for education allows parents to track their progress and adjust their savings strategies as needed. It provides a clear roadmap for achieving the desired educational outcomes.

*Peace of Mind:* Knowing that you have a financial plan in place for your child's education can provide peace of mind. It reduces uncertainty and allows parents to focus on other aspects of their child's development without constant worry about funding education.

In conclusion, early financial planning for tertiary education is essential for parents to ensure that they can provide their children with quality education without compromising their own financial stability. It allows for more effective financial management and better opportunities for both parents and students.
29/01/24, 1:03 pm - +27 84 416 1241: Well understood
29/01/24, 1:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's great, Is there anything you would like to ask me regarding the program now?
29/01/24, 1:47 pm - +27 84 416 1241: No for now
29/01/24, 1:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Ever, we have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
29/01/24, 1:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*

*Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

29/01/24, 2:12 pm - +27 84 416 1241: It was my pleasure talking to you and thanks for being patient with me.

Will come back to you as soon as possible.

Once again, I thank you
29/01/24, 2:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
30/01/24, 10:36 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Courtly, and Dear Parents,

Congratulations on clearing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program I hope you have learned about the program better through the previous sessions. Now, I will guide you to the most important *Eligibility check stage* after addressing your questions. 

Are you ready for the same?
30/01/24, 10:53 am - +27 84 416 1241: Greetings to you.

Yes take us through,we are ready.
30/01/24, 11:06 am - Pallika Edoofa: It is good to connect with you today, Ms. Ever,
I hope you are doing well
30/01/24, 11:06 am - Pallika Edoofa: I believe you have been following the sessions on the group regarding the program. What are your thoughts on the Edoofa Scholarship Program and do you have any questions for me, please?
30/01/24, 11:33 am - +27 84 416 1241: I don't have any questions for now but I believe Edoofa Scholarship Program is good and according to my researching i would recommend all African students to be part of it.
30/01/24, 11:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad you understand this opportunity's importance and the power to transform your child's career!
30/01/24, 11:42 am - Pallika Edoofa: May I know your thoughts regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please'
30/01/24, 12:35 pm - +27 84 416 1241: Regarding this I can say it's the best opportunity to happen to us as we can't afford the international university fees.
30/01/24, 12:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I do understand the challenges, did you manage to compare the cost of education in Zimbabwe with that through the Edoofa Scholarship Program?
30/01/24, 1:00 pm - +27 84 416 1241: I haven't done done that since my child has been aiming at international education
30/01/24, 1:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You see, Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months last year and let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
30/01/24, 1:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self-sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program. We also ensure they develop employability skills so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate. I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your child’s career, aren't you?
30/01/24, 1:07 pm - +27 84 416 1241: Oh yes you got me right because in Zimbabwe we have graduates who are loitering around without job and for that reason i am aiming for my child to graduate and get a job that's why I see Edoofa Program is a proper fit for her
30/01/24, 1:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: bsolutely, I understand your concern about job opportunities for graduates in Zimbabwe. Ensuring your child's education leads to tangible career prospects is crucial. The Edoofa Program indeed offers a comprehensive pathway for students to acquire the skills and experiences necessary to secure meaningful employment after graduation. It's a fitting choice to help your child achieve their career aspirations.

So, are willing to put in some extra efforts for your child's future?
30/01/24, 1:51 pm - +27 84 416 1241: More than willing
30/01/24, 2:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I appreciate your willingness to invest in your child’s career
30/01/24, 2:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the delay as I was having my lunch, please.
30/01/24, 2:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: May I know if Courtly is available?
30/01/24, 3:30 pm - +27 84 416 1241: She is still at school and will only be available in the next two hours. Kindly excuse me for that
30/01/24, 3:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As you know, A-level students are currently occupied with lessons and exam preparations due to which they are unavailable now. When you compare this with the Western African Countries students will be available with results much earlier than Zimbabweans, and there is a high chance that the scholarship seats would be occupied by them which in turn would be a loss for Zimbabwean students. At the same time, the day scholars in Zimbabwe are still applying and clearing the tests. 

All these factors have been a disadvantage for the boarding students and specifically the students who aren't supposed to use their devices in School. By the time they are back, the opportunity might be vacated by other applicants. This is the reason why our Academic Board along with the discussion with Universities has decided to allow parents to take part in the seat reservation interview for their children so that no deserving applicant is missed out. 

*So are you willing to take up the Seat Reservation Interview call for Courtly?*
30/01/24, 3:41 pm - +27 84 416 1241: No ways if it's an interview that she has to take I believe you and her will organise a time that suits her so you got to know your future student
30/01/24, 3:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Ms. Ever, If i will be scheduling the interview for 12:30 PM CAT Tomorrow, will she be available?
30/01/24, 3:59 pm - +27 84 416 1241: Let her answer this when she gets home
30/01/24, 3:59 pm - +27 84 416 1241: Because she is not allowed to use phones at school
30/01/24, 4:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's why I have suggested you  to have a seat reservation call for her as our Academic Board will be discussion on her behalf!
30/01/24, 6:08 pm - +27 84 416 1241: If you insist then i will stand in for her
31/01/24, 9:37 am - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to hear that!
31/01/24, 9:37 am - Pallika Edoofa: So, shall I schedule the same for 02:30 PM Today?
31/01/24, 9:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 11:48 am - +27 84 416 1241: Greetings everyone.

My apologies for not being on line I am having a tight schedule at work yesterday and today. I kindly ask if possible you can reschedule the interview for tomorrow.
01/02/24, 11:52 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, I understand!
02/02/24, 12:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good afternoon Everyone,
How is your day progressing?
02/02/24, 12:46 pm - +27 84 416 1241: All good thanks.
02/02/24, 12:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Ever, May I know when you will be available for the interview?
02/02/24, 1:13 pm - +27 84 416 1241: I am available now
02/02/24, 1:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I would like to know a convenient time for tomorrow!
02/02/24, 1:16 pm - +27 84 416 1241: 10: 30am CAT
02/02/24, 1:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As per the schedule of our acadmic board, may I know if you will be available at 12:00 PM CAT?
02/02/24, 1:19 pm - +27 84 416 1241: Yes I will be available
02/02/24, 1:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
02/02/24, 1:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I appreciate your willingness to participate in your child’s career!
Can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that your child would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will your child be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if your child is found eligible for the program?

5. After receiving the offer letter from the University, you will have to pay the registration fee to finalize your child’s university selection and reserve the scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in the first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of the first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
02/02/24, 1:36 pm - +27 84 416 1241: As much as i would like to answer this questions about, I haven't had time to discuss with my child which course she would like to study since we have found out that she is not eligible to study medicine because it was her first option.  

This then means that i will have to hear from her.
02/02/24, 2:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: May I know when you will be confirming that for me?
02/02/24, 2:58 pm - +263 77 698 4235: This message was deleted
02/02/24, 2:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: @263776984235 Can you please share this in English, as I am unable to understand that?
02/02/24, 3:00 pm - +263 77 698 4235: Sorry l made a mistake
02/02/24, 3:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Please share that in english
