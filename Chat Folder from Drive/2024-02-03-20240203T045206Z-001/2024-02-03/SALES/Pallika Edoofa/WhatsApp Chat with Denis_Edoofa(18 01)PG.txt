May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?
22/01/24, 2:29 pm - +263 71 727 3728: Well from what i understood about India 

1. Its Universities Are Well-Ranked and Climbing- The Indian Education system is vast in size, as well as its academic offerings. A vibrant and diverse education system means a wide variety of courses are available - from the modern and cutting edge to the traditional. Indian education ranges from exposure to the latest advancements of science and technology like Virtual and Augmented Reality, Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Computing to Yoga, Ayurveda, Sanskrit and classical dances.

2. It’s Home to the World’s Second-Largest Higher Education System- The Indian Education system is the world's second largest Higher Education System with more than 800 universities, 39,000 colleges and a capacity of enrolling more than a whopping 20 million students. Higher Education Institutions in India offer courses/degrees that are competitive in the world market in terms of quality but are delivered at one fourth the cost, hence guaranteeing value-for-money education. A burgeoning IT and Services sector has led to a robust placement oriented education as about 200 of the Fortune 500 companies hire regularly from Indian campuses.

3. It’s Affordable- Compared to many of the world’s finest institutions, India’s low cost of education is a bargain. 

4. It’s Economy Is On the Rise- India’s economy continues to surge.
22/01/24, 2:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your insights into India's education system. It's impressive to learn about the diverse range of courses, from cutting-edge technology to traditional arts. The sheer scale of India's higher education system, its affordability, and the rising economy indeed make it a compelling destination.
22/01/24, 2:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
22/01/24, 2:37 pm - +263 71 727 3728: ....Well i have no idea on that ..but im assuming its really expensive considering the Traveling costs .. accommodation and applications costs
22/01/24, 2:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

22/01/24, 3:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
22/01/24, 3:08 pm - +263 71 727 3728: ...Im sure they can afford
22/01/24, 3:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I would like to spare some time as I have to rush due to some personal issues, let's connect after few hours to continue our session and proceed towards the *STAGE 2*
22/01/24, 3:29 pm - +263 71 727 3728: ...its Ok Thank you
22/01/24, 9:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 9:18 am - +263 71 727 3728: ...Thank you
23/01/24, 10:07 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good Afternoon to you all,
How are you doing today?
23/01/24, 10:38 am - +263 71 727 3728: ...Im Fine thank you..
23/01/24, 10:46 am - Pallika Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for yesterday as I have to rush to an urgent meeting!
23/01/24, 10:48 am - Pallika Edoofa: Continuing the discussion, Good to know, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
23/01/24, 10:49 am - +263 71 727 3728: ...All Good I understand
23/01/24, 10:50 am - +263 71 727 3728: ...Im guessing through the Earn As You Earn Program
23/01/24, 10:57 am - Pallika Edoofa: That is alright!!
23/01/24, 10:57 am - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
23/01/24, 10:57 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
23/01/24, 10:57 am - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
23/01/24, 12:40 pm - +263 71 727 3728: ...From the looks of it I think this is a far more beneficial program as a student .Like you said Experience is the best teacher .I see it fit for a student to embark on the program even though they get credits but the best part is the experience in the field that they will be gaining
23/01/24, 12:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 12:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, your insight absolutely resonates well with the philosophy that experience is indeed the best teacher. The practical exposure gained through the program appears to be a valuable aspect for students, surpassing the credit benefits. I
23/01/24, 12:48 pm - +263 71 727 3728: ...I totally understand, Im convinced I wouldn't be one to miss out on this program given the opportunity
23/01/24, 12:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!!
23/01/24, 12:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
23/01/24, 12:57 pm - +263 71 727 3728: ....They are all of equal and uttermost significance to me so its a hard choice.

But i would rather say maybe number 4.
23/01/24, 12:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education, services and guidance
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

23/01/24, 12:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
23/01/24, 1:00 pm - +263 71 727 3728: ...Im guessing my family
23/01/24, 1:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s understandable,I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
23/01/24, 1:48 pm - +263 77 320 4496: personally As his mother I feel like this is really a great opportunity that he shouldn't miss . Considering the above mentioned benefits and advantages it's seems my boy will be at a greater advantage after completion of his course .So I feel great about it and I certainly approve
23/01/24, 1:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mrs. Gombakomba, 
I truly appreciate your positive perspective as a mother, recognizing the great opportunity and advantages for your son. Your approval is valued, and we're committed to ensuring he makes the most out of this enriching experience.
23/01/24, 1:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, I am glad to hear that, studying Internationally would make your child’s career advance at an even greater pace, as your child will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would help in uplifting your family and provide a hassle-free life.
23/01/24, 1:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
23/01/24, 2:44 pm - +263 71 727 3728: ...Not really i wasn't aware till now
23/01/24, 2:44 pm - +263 71 727 3728: ...here are the results as promised
23/01/24, 2:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please elaborate on this.
23/01/24, 2:45 pm - +263 71 727 3728: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 2:45 pm - +263 71 727 3728: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 2:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Oh I get it
23/01/24, 2:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing these!
23/01/24, 2:45 pm - +263 71 727 3728: Its Ok
23/01/24, 2:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also,  When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
23/01/24, 2:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 2:48 pm - +263 71 727 3728: ... Yes sure go ahead
23/01/24, 2:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
23/01/24, 2:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
23/01/24, 2:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
23/01/24, 2:51 pm - +263 71 727 3728: ...I Understand totally
23/01/24, 2:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!
23/01/24, 2:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 2:54 pm - +263 71 727 3728: ..i would like to believe we discussed up to stage 2
23/01/24, 2:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you?
23/01/24, 2:57 pm - +263 71 727 3728: ...Oh might have missed the fact i was actually in the stages 3 &4 lately..

Anyway go ahead I would gladly like to hear about 5&6
23/01/24, 2:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's right!
23/01/24, 2:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me explain the remaining steps
23/01/24, 2:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
23/01/24, 2:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
23/01/24, 3:01 pm - +263 71 727 3728: Im definitely clear with it..
23/01/24, 3:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you have any questions for me now?
23/01/24, 3:04 pm - +263 71 727 3728: ...Wanted to ask if you took biomedical engineering as the  final coarse i want to study ...because I hadn't fully weighed my options.. although i still want a degree in the medical field
23/01/24, 3:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely! Pursuing biomedical engineering is indeed a pathway to a degree in the medical field. It combines aspects of engineering with medical sciences, offering a unique and valuable perspective. I
23/01/24, 3:09 pm - +263 71 727 3728: ...I was asking if there is room for me to change that course if i change my mind .Is it too late?
23/01/24, 3:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: May I know to which course you want to change?
23/01/24, 3:31 pm - +263 71 727 3728: ... Nano-pharmaceutical
23/01/24, 3:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: For, That, Shall I explain *Bachelor of Pharmacy(B.Pharm.)* in depth?
23/01/24, 3:41 pm - +263 71 727 3728: ..yes sure

Congratulations on clearing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program I hope you have learned about the program better through the previous sessions. Now, I will guide you to the most important *Eligibility check stage* after addressing your questions. 

Are you ready for the same?
25/01/24, 10:05 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Everyone,
I was expecting a response from you, please!
25/01/24, 11:23 am - +263 71 727 3728: ..Hello Im online
25/01/24, 11:25 am - Pallika Edoofa: It is good to connect with you today, Denis,
I hope you are doing well
25/01/24, 11:25 am - Pallika Edoofa: Did you manage to discuss the Edoofa Program with your family, please?
25/01/24, 11:27 am - +263 71 727 3728: ...Indeed I am
25/01/24, 11:28 am - +263 71 727 3728: ...Yes I did
25/01/24, 11:29 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, can you provide a summary of your family discussions regarding the Edoofa Scholarship Program and share their thoughts after learning more about the program?
25/01/24, 11:52 am - +263 71 727 3728: Welo to be frank my Father is not at home so the discussion was between me and my mom and a family friend.So the summary of our discussion was as follows
"The Edoofa program seems to be beneficial and studying abroad is certainly better for you as it betters your resume because when applying for employment after graduation you need to be competent and an international degree can aid with that.
Besides exposure of different economic environment the Edoofa program is offering a chance to enhance your working ability and marketability through the EWYL program .
Edoofa seems to be the way to go for you.i see legitimacy in all they are saying and it is certain you will not be alone and left out as they will be with you throughout the course of your tertiary education."
Finally we had a chance to discuss on my course.
and i qoute.

"Growing up you were obsessed woth fixing things .radios and dead torches, you where always innovative in your ways .even though the medicine field is your passion but your strong suit is in physics.So i suggest you venture in the engineering field .even your results can attest to that ..you had an A in physics not in chemistry ."

So yesterday I had a chance to attend a Career Guidance gathering..and upon meditation of the advices given to me i have decided to opt for Electrical Engineering. I guess my mother will be appearing in this discussion supporting my notion later.
25/01/24, 12:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Denis, 
Thank you for sharing the insightful discussion you had with your mother and family friend regarding the Edoofa program and your future career path. It's clear that studying abroad offers numerous advantages, and the Edoofa program, with its focus on enhancing working ability and marketability through the Earn While You Learn program, seems like a promising opportunity. Your decision to pursue Electrical Engineering aligns well with your passion for fixing things and your strong suit in physics. It's wonderful to see you taking proactive steps towards your academic and career goals.

25/01/24, 1:08 pm - +263 71 727 3728: Understood
25/01/24, 1:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
25/01/24, 1:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: @263773204496 Dear Parent! you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
25/01/24, 1:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
25/01/24, 1:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*

01/02/24, 2:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Denis, I guess there are some technical issues, I will be sharing the amended letter with you by the end of the day!
01/02/24, 2:11 pm - +263 71 727 3728: Noted .Thank you so much.
01/02/24, 2:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, is there anything else you would like to ask?
01/02/24, 2:18 pm - +263 71 727 3728: ..Oh yes ..Well lets say I successfully become an Edoofian .So All the Four years of my course I will be staying in India Or during semester breaks can get back Home.
01/02/24, 2:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This message was deleted
01/02/24, 2:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, Denis, you see, after every semester there is a break, so after odd semesters like 1, 3, 5 breaks are usually of 7 to 10 days. However after Even semesters like 2, 4, 6 breaks are relatively long 2 to 3 weeks.
01/02/24, 2:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: During this break, if a student would like to stay back in India they can do that, if they wish to visit their home country they can do that too, all in all it is a student's decision. Majority of times, what I have seen is that students prefer exploring India and visit different parts of the country during these breaks.
01/02/24, 2:27 pm - +263 71 727 3728: Oh this is great Thank you  for the clarity
01/02/24, 2:28 pm - +263 71 727 3728: So my last question regards The traveling costs (flight to India). So in regards to that .is my family going to cater for that or the program does.
01/02/24, 2:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: If you understand the concept of international education finances that play a major role are not visa fees and flight tickets. The flight ticket is required a very limited number of times as the students don't travel that often. I don't mean to say that students can not go back to their country, they can definitely go back to enjoy the holidays. What I have personally seen is, the students do not travel that often.

So, considering the main finance which plays the most important role in international education is the annual fees. So, to reduce this annual fee, Edoofa helps a student with the Earn While You Learn Program. This program provides the students with an opportunity to earn scholarship credits which in return help them to make their education more affordable.

Visa fees and flight tickets are to be bought just a month before they plan to come to India. So, let's say the student wants to come to India in August 2024, This means that his family has to cater the Visa fee and the ticket in July 2024. If you understand the concept properly, till July 2024, the student will be working in the Earn While You Learn program and will be earning Scholarship credits. Now, with this opportunity, you can save a lot of money on the annual fee which in return helps you to make your flight ticket and the Visa fee affordable.

As mentioned to you already, the scholarship covers the tuition fees as you see, the Edoofa scholarship is basically the scholarship seats acquired from the universities for their good work in the past 14 years in the higher education space. So the travel costs will have to be covered by the student, But our admission team assist you in all the steps. So that you get the cheapest air travel tickets and also easily acquire the visa.

The cost of the visa is $83 for the entire course, and the flight cost will be around $400 to $500. But you need not worry about that yet as you will be coming to India in the month of July-August and till them the team would be helping you with your preparations.
01/02/24, 2:47 pm - +263 71 727 3728: ..I totally understand Thank you for this.
