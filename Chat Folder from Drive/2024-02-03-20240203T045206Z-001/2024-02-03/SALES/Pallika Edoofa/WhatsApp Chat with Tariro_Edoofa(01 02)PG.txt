01/02/24, 3:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you will be intrigued to study in India.
01/02/24, 3:54 pm - +263 73 242 2020: Definitely. I'd be happy to associate with Indian experts as well as getting good mentorship from them.With the given amazing facts i feel inspired and movited to study in India
01/02/24, 3:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That is amazing, As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
01/02/24, 4:03 pm - +263 73 242 2020: I've noticed that the fees ranges from about $3000 to $7000  per year, without a scholarship. But given the financial situation of my parents, they will not be able to afford it
01/02/24, 4:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
01/02/24, 4:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 4:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
01/02/24, 4:14 pm - +263 73 242 2020: Yes I do. My parents would really appreciate the reduction in the cost of education. After consulting them, they assured that they would sacrifice to ensure that I get quality education provided for me.
01/02/24, 4:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's wonderful to hear! Your parents' willingness to make sacrifices to ensure you receive a quality education is truly admirable. We understand the importance of reducing the cost of education and are committed to providing affordable options without compromising on quality.
01/02/24, 4:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also,
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
01/02/24, 4:20 pm - +263 73 242 2020: Yes please
01/02/24, 4:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
01/02/24, 4:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.

*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.

01/02/24, 4:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
01/02/24, 4:34 pm - +263 73 242 2020: The earn while you learn program will definitely add value to my resume to take up better jobs in the future. I will definitely benefit a lot from the earn while you learn program as it allows me to gain work experience and relevant skills while still in school.
01/02/24, 4:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 4:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.
01/02/24, 4:38 pm - +263 73 242 2020: Yes I do. Thank you for expanding and shedding more light on how the EWYL program works
01/02/24, 4:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great, Now as we proceed towards the end of the session, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
01/02/24, 4:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 9:36 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

*"If you can dream it, you can do it."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
02/02/24, 9:43 am - +263 73 242 2020: Greetings,
We are good to begin
02/02/24, 9:47 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that you are doing well too
02/02/24, 9:48 am - Pallika Edoofa: Also, as per our previous session, we are about to proceed to Stage 2 and for that I would like you to actively respond for the next 20-25 minutes!
02/02/24, 9:48 am - Pallika Edoofa: Please address this too
02/02/24, 9:56 am - +263 73 242 2020: All of the facts stand out for me .I believe that they are each significant as they each complement each other in one way or the other.
02/02/24, 9:59 am - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you have grabbed the whole program very well
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn

02/02/24, 9:59 am - Pallika Edoofa: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
02/02/24, 10:08 am - +263 73 242 2020: My parents will be trying their utmost best to provide and help with the remaining fee.However, in the event that something happens to my parents, the extended family will be ready to chip in. <This message was edited>
02/02/24, 10:16 am - Pallika Edoofa: That’s understandable,I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
02/02/24, 10:26 am - +263 73 242 2020: My family would be proud if I got the opportunity to study abroad. They are willing to sacrifice so that such an opportunity can be provided to me. Getting a scholarship will help us financially and remove the financial burden that comes with sending a child to school abroad
02/02/24, 10:33 am - +263 77 242 2162: We would really love her to study abroad and get quality education as you clearly indicated
02/02/24, 10:57 am - Pallika Edoofa: Tariro, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
02/02/24, 10:58 am - Pallika Edoofa: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
02/02/24, 10:58 am - Pallika Edoofa: I am really glad to hear that!
02/02/24, 11:07 am - +263 73 242 2020: No, I don't know of any other requirements
02/02/24, 11:13 am - +263 77 242 2162: Noted. Will assist her to have the highlighted requirements
02/02/24, 11:13 am - +263 77 242 2162: How do we access the online application form and or the offline one
02/02/24, 11:23 am - Pallika Edoofa: Please note that regarding the online application form our admissions team will be helping and guiding you!
02/02/24, 11:24 am - Pallika Edoofa: Also, Note that When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
02/02/24, 11:24 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 11:28 am - +263 77 242 2162: You're welcome to provide the information and guidance
02/02/24, 11:37 am - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
02/02/24, 11:37 am - Pallika Edoofa: Let me tell you that *why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
02/02/24, 11:39 am - Pallika Edoofa: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
02/02/24, 11:39 am - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
02/02/24, 9:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 9:17 pm - +263 73 242 2020: Thank you
