23/01/24, 12:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Thank you for sharing this, 
Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
23/01/24, 12:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, As your evaluation progresses, I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
23/01/24, 12:18 pm - +27 74 285 7749: Is the zimbabwe government involved in this programme or its a private thing
23/01/24, 12:22 pm - +27 69 810 2974: I'm still applying
23/01/24, 12:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mr Hillary, Edoofa Scholarship Program is an Indian Scholarship Program, however as a parent I can understand that your question is more regarding the legitimacy of the Program and process, so regarding the same, shall I share a few details with you please?

*Now, as you know, Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education Platform.*
May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?
25/01/24, 11:14 am - +263 78 583 1530: Ok
25/01/24, 11:17 am - +263 78 583 1530: Heard that it has some of the most well developed universities which offer undergraduate and postgraduate programs . They also offer PhD research there
25/01/24, 11:19 am - Pallika Edoofa: Tanyaradzwa, Also I am sure you might have gone through the reasons as to why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education, explained by Program Director Ms Davi back in your school group. Did you understand them properly?
25/01/24, 11:19 am - +263 78 583 1530: Additionally I would be encouraging some girls than came across such difficulties that everything is possible. I will open my own business and employ some of them to boost their life . I will also open a program which encourage girls to be more successful
25/01/24, 11:19 am - +263 78 583 1530: Yes
25/01/24, 11:20 am - Pallika Edoofa: Okay so Tanyaradzwa in that case, as you are aware of the reasons due to which Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination, can you now tell me in 100 to 150 words each:-

1)How would studying in India have a positive impact on your career?
2)How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
25/01/24, 11:34 am - +263 78 583 1530: It has positive impact because I will attaining good moral  values and  gain a global perspective . India is a country which was in history with the best moral values .Another benefit is to learn from the best professors and researchers in the world .many universities in India have their faculties which they are best in. In future I will be inspired because chance of being employed will be many. Lastly studying in India can improve my communication and interpersonal skills as well as improving problem solving . Here in  Africa most Indians inspire me because they the most successful people
25/01/24, 11:35 am - +263 78 583 1530: Studying in India can be my fully life-exchanging experience.
25/01/24, 11:42 am - Pallika Edoofa: Tanyaradzwa, It's wonderful to hear about the positive impact you foresee from studying in India. Embracing the rich moral values and gaining a global perspective are indeed invaluable experiences. Learning from esteemed professors and researchers can significantly enhance your academic journey and inspire future career opportunities. Additionally, honing communication, interpersonal, and problem-solving skills in such a diverse environment will undoubtedly prepare you for success.
25/01/24, 11:43 am - Pallika Edoofa: Also, That is amazing, As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
25/01/24, 11:45 am - +263 78 583 1530: Not yet
25/01/24, 12:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
25/01/24, 12:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 12:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
25/01/24, 12:25 pm - +263 78 583 1530: Yes
25/01/24, 12:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?

25/01/24, 1:06 pm - +263 78 583 1530: Yes
25/01/24, 1:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me know how!
25/01/24, 2:04 pm - +263 78 583 1530: Because it provides work opportunities to reduce costs of paying the tution fees
25/01/24, 2:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
25/01/24, 2:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
25/01/24, 2:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
25/01/24, 3:03 pm - +263 78 583 1530: Yes 💯%
25/01/24, 4:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the delay as I was having my lunch!
25/01/24, 4:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 4:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.

29/01/24, 9:46 am - +27 74 285 7749: No problem you can continue
29/01/24, 9:49 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that you are doing well today!
29/01/24, 9:50 am - Pallika Edoofa: Continuing the discussion, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
29/01/24, 9:51 am - +27 82 605 7855: Hello,yes
29/01/24, 10:11 am - +263 78 583 1530: 3
29/01/24, 10:21 am - Pallika Edoofa: Welcome to the session, Dear Parent!
29/01/24, 10:21 am - Pallika Edoofa: Great!

29/01/24, 10:58 am - +27 82 605 7855: Thanks

30/01/24, 9:33 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

*"With a dream, comes the potential for achievement."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
30/01/24, 9:38 am - +263 78 583 1530: My parents
30/01/24, 9:39 am - +27 82 605 7855: Hello
30/01/24, 9:42 am - +27 82 605 7855: Yes
30/01/24, 9:42 am - Pallika Edoofa: That’s understandable,I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
30/01/24, 9:42 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good afternoon Dear Parent!
30/01/24, 9:44 am - +27 82 605 7855: Good morning, it's morning here
30/01/24, 9:45 am - Pallika Edoofa: Tanyaradzwa, I've been anticipating prompt responses from you for the past few days but haven't received them. Could you please enlighten me on any particular reasons for this delay?
30/01/24, 9:47 am - +27 82 605 7855: Sorry to reply on her behalf ,she said earlier to me ,she is writing her month end exams
30/01/24, 9:47 am - +263 78 583 1530: Yes
30/01/24, 9:49 am - +263 78 583 1530: I'm having my monthly exams sorry for that
30/01/24, 9:52 am - +263 78 583 1530: After the program has ended ,my parents will be the one paying for my semester
30/01/24, 9:52 am - +263 78 583 1530: My network is a bit challenging also . I'm very sorry for my delays
30/01/24, 10:04 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, I understand!
30/01/24, 10:04 am - Pallika Edoofa: Please address this.
30/01/24, 10:36 am - +263 78 583 1530: It was always my dream to study abroad. I always  discuss going abroad with both of my parents. They also support me .
30/01/24, 10:45 am - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
30/01/24, 10:45 am - Pallika Edoofa: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
30/01/24, 10:52 am - +263 78 583 1530: I know those ones only
30/01/24, 11:05 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
30/01/24, 11:05 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/01/24, 11:07 am - +263 78 583 1530: Noted
30/01/24, 11:07 am - +263 78 583 1530: Yes
30/01/24, 11:10 am - Pallika Edoofa: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.

The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
30/01/24, 11:10 am - Pallika Edoofa: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
30/01/24, 11:10 am - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
30/01/24, 11:16 am - +263 78 583 1530: Noted
30/01/24, 11:17 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/01/24, 11:20 am - +263 78 583 1530: The first one
30/01/24, 11:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's right!
30/01/24, 11:23 am - Pallika Edoofa: Well, 
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you?
30/01/24, 11:25 am - +263 78 583 1530: Yes
30/01/24, 11:30 am - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
30/01/24, 11:30 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
30/01/24, 11:30 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6 :* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
30/01/24, 11:48 am - +263 78 583 1530: Yes
30/01/24, 11:50 am - Pallika Edoofa: Do you have any questions for me now?
30/01/24, 11:52 am - +263 78 583 1530: Not me.
 Maybe my parents
30/01/24, 11:54 am - +27 82 605 7855: No questions,thanks
30/01/24, 11:57 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright!
30/01/24, 11:57 am - Pallika Edoofa: Tanyaradzwa, we have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
30/01/24, 11:57 am - Pallika Edoofa: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*

*Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

30/01/24, 12:08 pm - +263 78 583 1530: But a question just popped up
30/01/24, 12:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, Please ask
30/01/24, 12:10 pm - +263 78 583 1530: Does the scholarship only pay for tution for only one semester
30/01/24, 12:12 pm - +263 78 583 1530: As well as the EWYL program
30/01/24, 12:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tanyaradzwa, it's important to understand that this scholarship program offers a 50-100% reduction in tuition fees for the duration of your entire course, not just for a single semester. This means you'll have the opportunity to finance your higher education independently. Additionally, you'll earn $50-100 in scholarship credits each month, which will gradually reduce your tuition fees and alleviate financial pressure on your parents.
30/01/24, 12:16 pm - +263 78 583 1530: Okay
30/01/24, 12:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Is there anything else you would like to ask?

May I know your thoughts regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
31/01/24, 12:02 pm - +27 82 605 7855: It's affordable as compared to other educational facilities and to my understanding the enrollment fees is affordable because  it will be less the cost since the scholarship program offers 50-100%
31/01/24, 12:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I appreciate your willingness to invest in your child’s career
31/01/24, 12:03 pm - +27 82 605 7855: Thanks

31/01/24, 12:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tanyaradzwa, Before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me?

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
31/01/24, 2:18 pm - +263 78 583 1530: Sorry for late response. I was having my monthly exams
31/01/24, 2:19 pm - +263 78 583 1530: Noted

31/01/24, 2:28 pm - +263 78 583 1530: 6The "Earn While You Learn" program is a relatively new concept in India, but it is quickly gaining popularity. This program allows students to gain practical experience while earning money at the same time. This model is especially beneficial for students who may not have the financial means to complete their education without working at the same time. This approach has been shown to be especially effective for vocational and technical programs, where students can gain valuable skills while earning money.
31/01/24, 2:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tanyardazwa, Please go through the above sessions and address these properly.
31/01/24, 2:30 pm - +263 78 583 1530: Ok
31/01/24, 2:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please note
31/01/24, 2:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: 1)*Bachelor of Commerce (B.com)*
31/01/24, 2:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: 2) India
3) The average cost of education in India is $6000-$8000
4) The annual fee after the scholarship is $2000-$3000
(FOR MVN Cases)
Even though, the cost of education through the Edoofa Scholarship ranges from $2000-$3000 per annum, based on your performance in the eligibility check stage and evaluation of our Admissions team, you can be considered for a higher quantum of scholarship which can reduce the costs even below $2000 inclusive of tuition and living. <This message was edited>

31/01/24, 2:39 pm - +263 78 583 1530: Yes
31/01/24, 2:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please go through this!
31/01/24, 2:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
31/01/24, 2:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: @27742857749 @27826057855 you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
31/01/24, 2:40 pm - +263 78 583 1530: I saw where I was wrong
31/01/24, 2:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
31/01/24, 2:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*

31/01/24, 2:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need
31/01/24, 2:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
31/01/24, 2:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below
31/01/24, 2:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 2:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope now you know Ideally, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 9th or 10th of February 2024 for $200 and the 9th or 10th of March for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 9th or 10th of February 2024

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
