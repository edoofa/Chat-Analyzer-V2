01/02/24, 9:31 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings to you all,
As scheduled, I am here to begin your sessions for the Edoofa Scholarship Program and evaluate your application.

Are you ready to begin?
01/02/24, 9:32 am - +263 78 484 8117: Im ready

How are you doing today?

01/02/24, 9:57 am - Pallika Edoofa: I am also doing well today
01/02/24, 9:58 am - Pallika Edoofa: As per the program protocols, it's essential to have the representation of your parents/guardians or whoever is supporting your education in the group. This ensures that they can follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions they may have. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.

*So, I am making you the group admin. I see one of your parents is already a part of the group. Please add other parent/guardians or educational supporters and let me know the names and the relations once done. Let me know if there is any challenge.*
01/02/24, 9:59 am - +263 78 292 8117: Can you please explain to me how Edoofa works because l clearly dont have an idea
01/02/24, 10:04 am - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, Mr. Zimanyiwa
01/02/24, 10:04 am - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Zimanyiwa, I will be guiding you through all the aspects of the Edoofa Program. However, just before we delve into that, I would like to get to know you better as a parent.

Please take a moment to share about yourself, including your occupation, highest educational qualification, your province, and what motivates you to support your child ahead for education.
01/02/24, 10:15 am - +263 78 292 8117: I always want the best for my child and wish that she becomes someone in life.As a girl child, I dont want her to be dependent on anyone in life thats why l want her to get a good education and get a good job in the future.What she has achieved so far academically motivates me to keep on supporting her because i have full faith in her that she will be someone great in life
01/02/24, 10:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Zimanyiwa, It's wonderful to hear that you're committed to supporting your daughter's education and independence. Your belief in her potential is a powerful motivator, and with your continued support, she's well on her way to achieving great things in life.

01/02/24, 10:31 am - +263 78 484 8117: University fees are very high and l just felt it would be a huge burden for my parents since we are twins and my parents might not afford both our school fees thats when l learnt from a friend about Edoofa and how it has helped many students from across the world to fulfill their dreams at affordable fees.l have also learnt that it wont be too difficult to find a job after graduating with the help of this programme which is a very huge advantage considering the high rate of unemployment in the world
