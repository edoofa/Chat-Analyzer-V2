02/02/24, 10:19 am - +263 77 776 9198: Because of some challenges we faced on 2021 there was an outbreak of covid-19 so I didn't have enough time for studying and finishing my syllabus.......
02/02/24, 10:42 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
02/02/24, 10:42 am - Pallika Edoofa: Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
02/02/24, 11:14 am - +263 77 776 9198: I am aiming higher for my Advanced level exams.
02/02/24, 11:24 am - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!

In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
02/02/24, 11:43 am - +263 77 776 9198: Thank you.
02/02/24, 11:44 am - +263 77 776 9198: I didn't do any research.
I didn't applied to any University abroad
02/02/24, 11:44 am - +263 77 776 9198: But that's my dream to study abroad
02/02/24, 11:48 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
