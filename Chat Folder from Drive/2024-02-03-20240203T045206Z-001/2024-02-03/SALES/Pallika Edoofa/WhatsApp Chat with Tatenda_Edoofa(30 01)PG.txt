30/01/24, 8:58 am - +27 62 284 7217: Yes thank you , it is the right person .
30/01/24, 9:32 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings to you all,
As scheduled, I am here to begin your sessions for the Edoofa Scholarship Program and evaluate your application.

Are you ready to begin?
30/01/24, 12:56 pm - +27 62 284 7217: Yes
30/01/24, 1:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Welcome to the session, Tatenda,
How are you doing today?
30/01/24, 1:01 pm - +27 62 284 7217: I'm alright , thank you for asking
I hope you're also well
30/01/24, 1:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes I am
30/01/24, 1:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As per the program protocols, it's essential to have the representation of your parents/guardians or whoever is supporting your education in the group. This ensures that they can follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions they may have. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.

*So, I am making you the group admin. I see one of your parents is already a part of the group. Please add other parent/guardians or educational supporters and let me know the names and the relations once done. Let me know if there is any challenge.*

We have received the application name for the Edoofa scholarship program and I will be taking you all forward through the counseling session to discuss and evaluate your application. Let me know once you are available! <This message was edited>
30/01/24, 2:50 pm - +27 78 362 3908: Ok cool. Plz enlighten us, what's up?
30/01/24, 2:51 pm - +27 78 362 3908: Noted
30/01/24, 2:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tatenda, it's good to see that you've invested time in understanding the program and submitting your application. Could you please share:
1)  What inspired you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?
2) What are your insights and understandings of the program as per your discussions with *Wessly*?
30/01/24, 2:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Mlokote, I will be guiding you through all the aspects of the Edoofa Program. However, just before we delve into that, I would like to get to know you better as a parent.

Please take a moment to share about yourself, including your occupation, highest educational qualification, your province, and what motivates you to support your child ahead for education.
30/01/24, 2:54 pm - +27 78 362 3908: Plz pardon me, I'm currently tied up now but I promise I will share my story with you as soon as Im done here, probably later in the day.
30/01/24, 3:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure!
30/01/24, 3:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: @27622847217 you can address this
30/01/24, 3:04 pm - +27 62 284 7217: 1) I have always wanted to study abroad after the recent fee increase at universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000- ZWL 550000 per semester, when calculating including food and accommodation it is more than $1 700 in Zimbabwe of which we can't afford that amount of money. Many people are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe because of the economy.
I also heard about the  partial employment during the course i.e the Earn While You Learn program at EDOOFA which gives opportunity to earn $50-$100 per month throughout the course.
You can complete your tertiary education at costs less than universities in Zimbabwe 

2) According to my discussions with Wessly, my insights are that, there is the Edoofa Earn While You Learn program, which allows you to learn while you are partially employed.
30/01/24, 3:06 pm - +27 62 284 7217: He is Leadson Mlokote
Aged 39
He works as an Ubber driver
He stays in Johannesburg, South Africa
Has a diploma in Journalism 

What motivates him is that, he was unable to find employment after graduating in Zimbabwe and working as an Ubber driver , he can't afford university fees
30/01/24, 3:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tatenda, Thank you for sharing your insights and experiences regarding the challenges of pursuing higher education in Zimbabwe. It's clear that the recent fee increases have made studying abroad a more appealing option, especially considering the financial strain many families face. The Earn While You Learn program at Edoofa indeed offers a practical solution by allowing students to earn during their studies, making tertiary education more accessible and affordable.
30/01/24, 3:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, I am glad to see your understanding of the Edoofa program and appreciate your aspirations, let me guide you further to gain more knowledge on this opportunity.
30/01/24, 3:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

We're 5 in my family, my parents and 3 kids. Our parents stay in South Africa and we stay in Zimbabwe with our father's relatives.

Are you ready?
02/02/24, 9:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Hi Tatenda, I hope you are in good health.

I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program as we have discussed your application, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put your application on hold temporarily. However please Note by Saturday, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply  

Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program
