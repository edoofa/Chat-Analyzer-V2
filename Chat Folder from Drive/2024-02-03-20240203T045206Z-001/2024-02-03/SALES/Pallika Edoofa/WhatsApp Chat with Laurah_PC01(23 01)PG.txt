Upon completion of her primary she went to a boarding school where she did her form one until four . Passed her ordinary level with 9 subjects with good passes. She is currently doing advanced level upper six specializing in Arts. She is a good talker whom I feel if she would pursue law she will excel. Laurah is a confident person who is open to air her views. Considering her age so far as a parent who spends most of my time with her I don't have any challenges interms of discipline and responsibilities. She is good with others ,very social and responsible even in carrying out her duties as a child or as a big sister to her brother. She loves reading novels online and watching television. She is not an outgoing person ,enjoys indoor activities. 
Her family is madeup of me and my husband and her little brother aged 11. Am an environmental healthy officer under the ministry of homeaffars currently working at Zrp Gweru camp clinic here in Zimbabwe. The father is self employed,he buys and sell stationery here in Zimbabwe. As a family we look forward to her future as she is our first born child whom we are trying to help her have a better future.

Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.

*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*
It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development.

*Good Verbal Communication*– A lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding which are crucial for a successful career in law.
*Good Time Management*– In the legal profession, time management is very crucial. The art of delegating tasks, working within deadlines, and prioritizing tasks to achieve success is very essential.

*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.
*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.

24/01/24, 9:46 am - Pallika Edoofa: So, are you willing to pursue this course?

24/01/24, 10:56 am - Pallika Edoofa: Laurah and Mr. Makazha,  now as we proceed ahead, I am sure you might have gone through the reasons as to why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education, explained by Program Director Ms Davi back in your school group. Did you understand them properly?
24/01/24, 10:57 am - +263 77 280 9068: Good morning
24/01/24, 11:41 am - +263 77 373 2501: Well yes i did understand her
24/01/24, 12:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This message was deleted
24/01/24, 12:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
24/01/24, 12:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am sure that, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
24/01/24, 3:41 pm - +263 77 373 2501: No am not.
24/01/24, 3:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
24/01/24, 3:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 3:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
24/01/24, 4:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 9:56 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greeting Everyone,
How are you all doing today?
25/01/24, 10:08 am - +263 77 280 9068: We are fine
25/01/24, 10:12 am - +263 77 373 2501: We good and you
25/01/24, 10:39 am - Pallika Edoofa: I am also doing well!
25/01/24, 10:39 am - Pallika Edoofa: I was expecting your response on this!
25/01/24, 10:55 am - +263 77 280 9068: Will try to work on it
25/01/24, 11:23 am - Pallika Edoofa: I can understand,
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
25/01/24, 11:32 am - +263 77 280 9068: I don't know
25/01/24, 11:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
25/01/24, 11:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
25/01/24, 11:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
26/01/24, 9:23 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/01/24, 9:25 am - +263 77 280 9068: Ok noted
26/01/24, 9:26 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good afternoon, Ms. Matambo,
Have a great weekend!
26/01/24, 9:47 am - +263 77 280 9068: Thank y
29/01/24, 9:45 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings to you all,
As scheduled, I am here to continue your sessions and evaluate your application.
29/01/24, 9:45 am - +263 77 280 9068: Good morning
29/01/24, 9:58 am - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Makazha, I hope that you are doing well.
29/01/24, 10:02 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 10:02 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that you have gone through this, If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.

*"With a dream, comes the potential for achievement."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
30/01/24, 9:35 am - +263 77 280 9068: Fine how are you
30/01/24, 9:58 am - Pallika Edoofa: I am also doing well, Thank you for asking!
30/01/24, 10:00 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that you have gone through this, So, let's end our counseling session and proceed to Stage 2.
30/01/24, 10:00 am - Pallika Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?

31/01/24, 10:04 am - Pallika Edoofa: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
31/01/24, 10:07 am - +263 77 373 2501: My parents will be helping.
31/01/24, 10:25 am - Pallika Edoofa: That’s understandable,I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
31/01/24, 2:24 pm - +263 77 373 2501: They are okay with it because as they said all they want is for me to learn and be independent in life.
They think its an opportunity to reach great heights in life.
31/01/24, 2:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
31/01/24, 2:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
31/01/24, 2:39 pm - +263 77 373 2501: No please share some more
31/01/24, 2:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
31/01/24, 2:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Laurah, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
31/01/24, 2:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 2:53 pm - +263 77 373 2501: Wow that's wonderful
31/01/24, 2:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.

The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
31/01/24, 2:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
31/01/24, 2:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
31/01/24, 2:57 pm - +263 77 373 2501: Yes
31/01/24, 3:03 pm - +263 77 373 2501: Okay ma'am but can I ask something about the Alevel results
31/01/24, 3:04 pm - +263 77 373 2501: What are the required Alevel results
31/01/24, 3:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Laurah, Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
31/01/24, 3:20 pm - +263 77 373 2501: Yes I am
31/01/24, 3:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
31/01/24, 3:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 3:21 pm - +263 77 373 2501: Stage 1
31/01/24, 3:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, 
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you?
31/01/24, 3:23 pm - +263 77 373 2501: Okay you can
31/01/24, 3:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
31/01/24, 3:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
31/01/24, 3:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6 :* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
31/01/24, 3:45 pm - +263 77 373 2501: Yes
31/01/24, 3:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you have any queries?
31/01/24, 3:46 pm - +263 77 373 2501: No for now i have understood everything
31/01/24, 3:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That is well noted!
31/01/24, 3:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: we have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
31/01/24, 3:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*

*Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

Happy Family Discussion
01/02/24, 10:37 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Laurah, and Dear Parents,

Congratulations on clearing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program I hope you have learned about the program better through the previous sessions. Now, I will guide you to the most important *Eligibility check stage* after addressing your questions. 

Are you ready for the same?
01/02/24, 10:45 am - +263 77 280 9068: Ready carry on
01/02/24, 10:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: It is good to connect with you today, Ms. Matambo,
I hope you are doing well
01/02/24, 10:56 am - Pallika Edoofa: I believe you have been following the sessions on the group regarding the program. What are your thoughts on the Edoofa Scholarship Program and do you have any questions for me, please?
01/02/24, 11:02 am - +263 77 280 9068: No questions. Want to hear about this important eligibility check stage .
01/02/24, 11:06 am - Pallika Edoofa: I will be guiding you for this further!
01/02/24, 11:06 am - Pallika Edoofa: May I know your thoughts regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
01/02/24, 11:09 am - +263 77 280 9068: If resources permit the cost is fair .
01/02/24, 11:12 am - Pallika Edoofa: I appreciate your willingness to invest in your child’s career.
01/02/24, 11:12 am - Pallika Edoofa: May I know if Laurah is available?
01/02/24, 11:13 am - +263 77 280 9068: She's at school in class right now. And am at work like now . Lecture time at my workplace
01/02/24, 11:13 am - +263 77 280 9068: Will go through what you are sending later after work.
01/02/24, 11:15 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
01/02/24, 11:15 am - Pallika Edoofa: As you know, A-level students are currently occupied with lessons and exam preparations due to which they are unavailable now. When you compare this with the Western African Countries students will be available with results much earlier than Zimbabweans, and there is a high chance that the scholarship seats would be occupied by them which in turn would be a loss for Zimbabwean students. At the same time, the day scholars in Zimbabwe are still applying and clearing the tests. 

All these factors have been a disadvantage for the boarding students and specifically the students who aren't supposed to use their devices in School. By the time they are back, the opportunity might be vacated by other applicants. This is the reason why our Academic Board along with the discussion with Universities has decided to allow parents to take part in the seat reservation interview for their children so that no deserving applicant is missed out. 

*So are you willing to take up the Seat Reservation Interview call for Laurah?*
02/02/24, 3:44 pm - +263 77 373 2501: Afternoon ma'am
02/02/24, 3:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good evening Laurah,

But am back now
02/02/24, 3:48 pm - +263 77 373 2501: Yes i am
02/02/24, 3:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
02/02/24, 3:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: May I know if you will be available at 08:30 AM Tomorrow?
02/02/24, 4:15 pm - +263 77 373 2501: No i wont be... Unless if its before that time or after that

02/02/24, 4:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Will she take the seat reservation call on your behalf!
02/02/24, 4:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I do appreciate your understanding of the current circumstances with the large number of applicants and the restricted number of scholarship slots, particularly during this time when the A-level results are being announced. Given the significance of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and the volume of applications we are presently receiving, it would be greatly appreciated if you could respond to be considered for a scholarship seat. 
*I believe you are a deserving candidate!*
02/02/24, 4:33 pm - +263 77 280 9068: What is it about now
02/02/24, 4:35 pm - +263 77 373 2501: Thank you ma'am.
