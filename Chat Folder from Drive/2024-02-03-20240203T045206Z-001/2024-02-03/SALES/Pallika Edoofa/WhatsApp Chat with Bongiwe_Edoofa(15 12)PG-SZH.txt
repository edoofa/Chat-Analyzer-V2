15/12/23, 2:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Bongiwe, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
15/12/23, 2:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country.

15/12/23, 4:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Bongiwe, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.

Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
15/12/23, 4:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
15/12/23, 4:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
15/12/23, 4:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
15/12/23, 4:50 pm - +263 77 523 3547: Considering work opportunity and studing should we not be able to pay its fine, from what has been explained above we cn manage
15/12/23, 4:50 pm - +263 78 083 1004: Ok l think my parents can cope with the yearly amount
15/12/23, 4:51 pm - +263 78 083 1004: You mean you can manage the amount
15/12/23, 4:51 pm - +263 77 523 3547: Yes
15/12/23, 4:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that, Mr. Bongani
15/12/23, 4:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
15/12/23, 4:55 pm - +263 78 083 1004: Thank you, okay l understand
15/12/23, 4:56 pm - +263 78 083 1004: Yes it is affordable
15/12/23, 4:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that!!

So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?

15/12/23, 5:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
15/12/23, 5:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
15/12/23, 5:02 pm - +263 78 083 1004: Yes l do
15/12/23, 5:03 pm - +263 78 083 1004: I think the program is a great idea and it helps  students gain exposure
15/12/23, 5:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
15/12/23, 5:13 pm - +263 77 278 7047: l think  the learning  while  earning  will  be a great  opportunity  for my daughter  to explore  more  endeavors  to her  goals  in her career
15/12/23, 5:15 pm - +263 78 083 1004: So is my session over yet for today or are there any further questions that l might need

15/12/23, 5:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Welcome to the session, Ms. Sithabiso,
I hope that you are doing well. <This message was edited>
15/12/23, 5:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed it is!
15/12/23, 5:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Bongiwe, We are about to end!
15/12/23, 5:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Now, As we are proceeding towards the end of the session, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
15/12/23, 5:41 pm - +263 78 083 1004: 4
15/12/23, 5:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on *Higher Education Concierge*

Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

15/12/23, 5:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
15/12/23, 5:45 pm - +263 78 083 1004: My father
15/12/23, 5:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
15/12/23, 5:52 pm - +263 78 083 1004: If by remaining fee you mean the  $2000-3000 a year
15/12/23, 5:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Bongiwe, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
15/12/23, 5:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
15/12/23, 5:58 pm - +263 78 083 1004: They are considering the thought as it comes with many opportunities but as parents they are also insecure in terms of scams , hijacking ,racism and language barrier as l would be considering to go in a unfamiliar country.
15/12/23, 6:00 pm - +263 78 083 1004: I think this is it for more l think l will do further research
15/12/23, 6:01 pm - +263 78 083 1004: In an
15/12/23, 6:02 pm - +263 77 278 7047: Thank yu yes l am
15/12/23, 6:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Bongiwe, I completely understand your concerns about yourself considering studying in an unfamiliar country. It's natural to worry about potential challenges such as scams, hijacking, racism, and language barriers. I want to assure you that your concerns are valid, and your child's safety is our top priority. <This message was edited>
15/12/23, 6:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, Being a parent, the concern regarding the welfare and personal development of their child is absolutely understandable. 

To give a glimpse, we have a community of more than 2500 Zimbabweans with  300+ associate schools from Zimbabwe with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, and parents, who have been bringing success stories of Edoofians for the past 14+ years due to the kind of foster and care that we provide throughout their course!

With UGC-approved Universities whose degrees are Globally accredited, and which have all security and healthcare facilities including counselling departments, Edoofians are exposed to a conducive environment that motivates them to focus on their career and achieve their dreams. There are Zimbabwean Communities at Every University so no child will feel lonely. Moreover, our Admission Team, EWYL(Earn While You Learn) mentor and counsellor of a student will be available to him/her throughout the course. At any point, if the student or parent needs assistance we will be readily accessible. This is the reason why Edoofa is known as a *Higher Education Concierge!*

The Universities are strict in terms of the welfare of children. Being in Zimbabwe itself, your parents will be able to track the happenings, academic performance, and University details
15/12/23, 6:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 6:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 6:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
15/12/23, 6:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
15/12/23, 6:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 6:18 pm - +263 78 083 1004: Ok this information is relieving  thank you so much for the assurance
15/12/23, 6:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
15/12/23, 6:25 pm - +263 78 083 1004: So when is this fee payed
15/12/23, 6:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
15/12/23, 6:26 pm - +263 78 083 1004: Yes please
15/12/23, 6:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
15/12/23, 6:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
15/12/23, 6:29 pm - +263 78 083 1004: Ok l understand
15/12/23, 6:30 pm - +263 78 083 1004: So what does a reservation letter consist
15/12/23, 6:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Kindly excuse for the delay as I was having my dinner.
15/12/23, 6:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 7:03 pm - +263 78 083 1004: it's okay
15/12/23, 7:03 pm - +263 78 083 1004: Loading
15/12/23, 7:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me know once downloaded!
15/12/23, 7:20 pm - +263 78 083 1004: This message was deleted
15/12/23, 7:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
15/12/23, 7:29 pm - +263 78 083 1004: Or maybe 01 am not sure
15/12/23, 7:29 pm - +263 78 083 1004: I think this was my counseling session
15/12/23, 7:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's right!!!
15/12/23, 7:32 pm - +263 78 083 1004: Yes
15/12/23, 7:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5*: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.



*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*



This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
15/12/23, 7:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
15/12/23, 7:43 pm - +263 78 083 1004: Yes we are
15/12/23, 7:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Bongiwe, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*
 
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
15/12/23, 7:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*

After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
16/12/23, 1:20 pm - +263 77 523 3547: Thank yu for warm welcome.
16/12/23, 1:21 pm - +263 78 083 1004: 1. B.Sc  in Cardiovascular Technology.
2. India
3.  $6000-$8000 per annum
4. $2000-$3000 per annum
5.  I would have to pay a fee of $350  for enrollment if found eligable, it's supposed to be paid in 7 days but through a realisation that some families might not be able to pay a full amount at the stated time Edoofa has made it possible for them to pay $200  in  7 days and the remaining fee after 30 days.
6.  Basically the earn while you learn program  is the brain child of the edoofa organization to help out students who want to study abroad like me, It is where an individual is given a series of projects to help them gain extra credit to reduce  costs for higher education .These projects may be social media marketing, community building and data entry to mention a few. The earn while you learn program can reduce tuition costs for example education cost in India without Edoofa is   $6000-$8000 but through the extra credit it falls to half the prize and if an individual still feels like the amount is still unaffordable they can earn more credits which are in form of money and can directly be added to the remaining tuition fees.The earn while you learn program  starts immediately after  payment of enrollment fee to reserve a spot in the scholarship program and the projects may be done as the  student learns still waiting for A level results.

27/01/24, 10:51 am - +263 77 278 7047: yes
27/01/24, 10:52 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Go ahead, what would you like to ask please?
27/01/24, 11:13 am - +263 78 083 1004: I will also revisit it again
27/01/24, 11:14 am - +263 77 278 7047: Thank yu sir am answered
27/01/24, 11:21 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: What else would you like to ask please?

27/01/24, 11:39 am - +263 77 278 7047: let me revisit  the letter  again  will update  yu
27/01/24, 11:56 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Sure @263772787047, meanwhile you must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

Which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
27/01/24, 12:00 pm - +263 77 278 7047: The second  on which  is based  in Zimbabwe
27/01/24, 12:02 pm - +263 77 278 7047: one*
27/01/24, 12:03 pm - +263 77 523 3547: Thank you so much , l have gone through the letter of acceptance for Bongiwe Msipa well understood.
27/01/24, 12:04 pm - +263 77 523 3547: 2
27/01/24, 12:04 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: So far @263775233547 would you like to ask anything please?
27/01/24, 12:04 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Let me brief you about it in depth!
27/01/24, 12:04 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Okay so @263775233547 basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
27/01/24, 12:04 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333038014048828

27/01/24, 12:05 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: For your reference, I have shared a few recently completed fee receipts, once you complete the formality using this mode you would receive a similar receipt please.
27/01/24, 12:05 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Meanwhile @263775233547 @263772787047, you see a lot of students who stay in the outskirts of the towns prefer using alternative fee completion mode that saves them the traveling expenses. Since I am aware that in Zimbabwe if you have to travel from one town to another you end up spending anywhere between $5-$10 one side, which becomes expensive considering just to go to the bank and complete the formalities. 

So alternatively the Board has provided flexibility to parents who wish to complete formalities to Mrs Jerera using Ecocash and Mukuru. Shall I share those details with you as well for your convenience please?
27/01/24, 12:08 pm - +263 77 523 3547: It ws on issue of depositing of funds now answered thank you so much.
27/01/24, 12:08 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Alright @263775233547, anything else you wish to ask please?
27/01/24, 12:19 pm - +263 77 523 3547: Yes
27/01/24, 12:23 pm - +263 77 523 3547: So far am answered no question thank yu so much.
27/01/24, 12:51 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Alright @263775233547. in that case I wish you a great day ahead please.
27/01/24, 1:10 pm - +263 77 523 3547: Thank you

29/01/24, 10:13 am - +263 77 523 3547: Yes we have and now working on payment issue just need to know my deadline of payment
29/01/24, 10:36 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: @263775233547 the due date of the formalities 1st February, however it would be of great benefit for Bongiwe incase you manage to complete a part of the formalities on or before 31st January. 

While I do understand that the deadline is of 1st February, the key benefit your child would have in this case would be to start the process early with the students who became a part of the Edoofa Program in the Month of January2024. This inturn would help you to interact with the Admission Team even more early so that you can have a much better financial planning with them. <This message was edited>
