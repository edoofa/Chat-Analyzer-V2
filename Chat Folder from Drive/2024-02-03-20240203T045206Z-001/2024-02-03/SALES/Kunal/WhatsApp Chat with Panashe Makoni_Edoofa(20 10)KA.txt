02/01/24, 12:25 pm - Kunal: Greetings to you all

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.

*Please Note by tomorrow*, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply
13/01/24, 9:10 am - Kunal: Greetings everyone
We have been expecting your responses and participation in the session.

We are putting a formal closure to your application. Feel free to re-apply when you are ready to come to India for your higher education. However, in case you come across any of your friends or family members who would like to study abroad for their higher education, please share the following document with them and ask them to read it. After reading if they wish to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, you can share my number and ask them to fill out the application form and share the filled application with me.

As per the program protocols, it's essential to have the representation of your parents/guardians or whoever is supporting your education in the group. This ensures that they can follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions they may have. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.
*So, I am making you the group admin, please add your parents/guardians or educational supporters and let me know the names and the relations once done.*
