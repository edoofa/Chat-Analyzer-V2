30/01/24, 4:57 pm - +263 78 688 3426: Ok sure so I am Kudakwashe Matare from Zvimba which is sited in Mashonaland West but I am currently residing in Harare. I am an U6 student at Mt Pleasant School. I’m a good volleyball player. My strength is my belief in the Almighty. I was born in a family of five (5) exclusive of my mother and father. I’m the middle child with two of my elder brothers self dependent and my younger brother and sister still in school. I’m a student interested in Business administration. I believe I want to achieve the masters degree in business administration. My father is currently serving his last year as a police officer in the Ministry of Home Affairs and my mother is not employed. My father is a graduate and on a sad note my mother could not finish up her O’Level. As mentioned earlier, two of my elder brothers are self dependent and are staying on their own with the other one staying with his wife. And the younger ones are in school, the one after me is in form 2 and the last born my sister she is in grade 2. Luckily up until now, my father haas been funding for my education. For my higher education abroad my family will be funding for my education. I also have stubborn faith in getting a scholarship that will help my family to cater for my education financially. I did my O Level at Howard High School and I am currently doing my A Level at Mount Pleasant High and back then our fees at Howard summed up to roughly a total of maybe $600 USD. The school fees at Mount Pleasant High is currently $150 USD.
