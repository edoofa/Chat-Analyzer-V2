The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.  The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.

*2) Lawyer*
As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law. Their main job role is to represent their clients in jurisdiction matters. Their work involves a lot of research, including that on the subject and their client’s perspective.

*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*
It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development. Although an individual may possess certain skills they need to be improved and developed constantly. A few key skills that are of paramount importance in the field of law are:

*Good Written Communication*– Writing forms a major part of the work in in the legal profession. The written communication involves letters, documents, notices, and so on. The documents must be grammatically correct and error free. This requires a good level of English proficiency.

*Good Verbal Communication*– A lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding which are crucial for a successful career in law.

*Good Time Management*– In the legal profession, time management is very crucial. The art of delegating tasks, working within deadlines, and prioritizing tasks to achieve success is very essential.

*A great degree of self-confidence*– This profession needs a high degree of self-confidence to win the clients’ trust. A strong belief in yourself will go a long way in winning arguments and cases.

*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.

*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.
24/01/24, 3:26 pm - +263 78 525 6860: So if I may ask, if I study law in India is it that I'll stick with the Indian law based on the fact that I'll be  studying the Indian constitution while partaking on my studies
24/01/24, 3:28 pm - Kunal: There are few courses in the field of Commerce and Law which have similar basics across the Globe but the syllabus varies based on the location where you study the course

Let us take the example of the law. The basics of law are the same if you study from Zimbabwe, India, the USA, the UK etc but vary in terms of the economy, governance of a country, legislation etc. Once the student completes the course and wants to practice in a different country, then the BAR Council of the country will evaluate the subjects of the students and there would be an exam which he/she needs to clear after which they can practice law in that country. This procedure is the same if you want to practice it in any country. The Indian law degree is internationally accredited and you can practice Globally
24/01/24, 3:31 pm - +263 78 525 6860: Okay so if law is 5 years does that mean that I will have to spend more given years to study law of a certain country that I'm willing to practice law at?
24/01/24, 3:37 pm - Kunal: The preparation period for the exam can be efficiently completed within a timeframe of six months or even less. Following this preparation, individuals can proceed to take the exam and subsequently practice law in their respective countries. This streamlined process allows for a focused and effective approach to acquiring the necessary qualifications for a legal career.
24/01/24, 3:38 pm - +263 78 525 6860: Okay understood thank you
24/01/24, 3:39 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that!
As we've thoroughly covered the course details can you tell me how you see yourself in 5 years after your course and If you are provided with this career option and how can being an Edoofian enable you to achieve your career goals?
24/01/24, 3:53 pm - +263 78 525 6860: As you have mentioned before with  Edoofa I'm aware that there will be employability outcome and also on a lighter note I'll get to explore other parts of the world and that is of course India <This message was edited>
24/01/24, 4:11 pm - Kunal: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time. I believe you will be researching more about the course in detail.

So now as you are aware that Edoofa Recommends *India* as a Higher Education Platform
May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?
24/01/24, 4:23 pm - +263 78 525 6860: India has been proclaimed as one of the most countries on market based on their educational system zone which is why I have applied to be educated there however my fear now is   communication as there may be a language barrier based on the fact that many students use Hindi instead of English as it may happen under given circumstances <This message was edited>

24/01/24, 4:25 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 4:25 pm - Kunal: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
24/01/24, 4:37 pm - +263 78 525 6860: Positive impacts are as Practical skill development,academic excellence, professional growth ,and also by studying in india I will be recognized all over the world as I apply for jobs in the mere future because of studying in India
24/01/24, 4:41 pm - Kunal: Amazing!
As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education  which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
24/01/24, 4:41 pm - +263 78 525 6860: No
24/01/24, 4:43 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
24/01/24, 4:43 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 4:43 pm - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
24/01/24, 4:45 pm - +263 78 525 6860: So this is per a year or semester
24/01/24, 4:48 pm - +263 78 525 6860: Yes however this may also be the parent's say
24/01/24, 4:56 pm - Kunal: Are you clear now?
24/01/24, 4:56 pm - +263 78 525 6860: Yes
24/01/24, 4:58 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
24/01/24, 4:58 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to Become an all-rounder in the Ever-changing Professional World by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to Network like a Boss by Ms Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an Employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s Never Too Late to Pursue Your Passion: My Journey from Real Estate to Entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the Science of Personal Branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
24/01/24, 4:58 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 5:01 pm - +263 78 525 6860: Yes.
24/01/24, 5:01 pm - Kunal: Indeed,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. _This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families?
24/01/24, 5:02 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 5:05 pm - +263 78 525 6860: Yes it is very much clear provided with the given example
24/01/24, 5:05 pm - Kunal: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
24/01/24, 5:10 pm - +27 62 784 0122: When  is the intake and payment  dadeline
24/01/24, 5:12 pm - +263 78 525 6860: They all seem to be of great significance also considering the fact that you have elaborated the first three in detail I consider the 4th as the most significant in this instance
24/01/24, 5:15 pm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education, services and guidance
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.
24/01/24, 5:15 pm - Kunal: Let me take you ahead to understand the same

24/01/24, 5:16 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
24/01/24, 5:26 pm - +27 62 784 0122: We siphephile moyo mother and Christopher Moyo father of Racheal  Moyo will be paying the fees
24/01/24, 5:27 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, studying Internationally would make your child’s career advance at an even greater pace, as your child will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would help in uplifting your family and provide a hassle-free life.
24/01/24, 5:27 pm - Kunal: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
24/01/24, 5:39 pm - +27 62 784 0122: As parents  we have read and understood
24/01/24, 5:42 pm - Kunal: When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
24/01/24, 5:42 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 6:18 pm - Kunal: Shall we proceed?
24/01/24, 6:26 pm - +27 62 784 0122: Yes
24/01/24, 6:29 pm - Kunal: Rachael has completed her A level, right? <This message was edited>
24/01/24, 6:30 pm - +263 78 525 6860: Yes
24/01/24, 6:31 pm - Kunal: Well noted
24/01/24, 6:31 pm - Kunal: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
24/01/24, 6:31 pm - Kunal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
24/01/24, 6:53 pm - Kunal: Are we connected?
24/01/24, 7:22 pm - +27 62 784 0122: Yes
24/01/24, 7:22 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 7:25 pm - +27 62 784 0122: Stage1
24/01/24, 7:26 pm - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
24/01/24, 7:27 pm - +27 62 784 0122: Yes
24/01/24, 7:27 pm - Kunal: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
24/01/24, 7:27 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
24/01/24, 7:33 pm - Kunal: We have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
24/01/24, 7:33 pm - Kunal: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*

*Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

Congratulations on clearing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program I hope you have learned about the program better through the previous sessions. Now, I will guide you to the most important *Eligibility check stage* after addressing your questions. 

Are you ready for the same?
25/01/24, 1:06 pm - +263 78 525 6860: Yes
25/01/24, 1:07 pm - Kunal: It is good to hear from you
Did you manage to discuss the Edoofa Program with your family, please?
25/01/24, 1:19 pm - +27 62 784 0122: Yes
25/01/24, 1:19 pm - Kunal: Good to know, can you provide a summary of your family discussions regarding the Edoofa Scholarship Program and share their thoughts after learning more about the program?
25/01/24, 1:25 pm - +263 78 525 6860: This message was deleted
25/01/24, 1:40 pm - +27 62 784 0122: I don't think there is any importance about any of  the thing that we discussed as a family however the fact remain still that we are willing to continue with Edoofa as the scholarship of our child
25/01/24, 1:44 pm - Kunal: That is fine

Is there anything you would like to ask me regarding the program now?
25/01/24, 1:44 pm - +27 78 917 9114: Yesterday we have discussed everything and we have agreed in the group
25/01/24, 1:45 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that from you, Mr Christopher
25/01/24, 1:48 pm - +27 78 917 9114: Yes do you have officies in Byo or Harare so that my daughter can come and see the reps or admin
25/01/24, 1:49 pm - Kunal: Please note that we don't have an office in Zimbabwe since it would be challenging to set up an office in the 29+ countries from which we receive applications. The nearest office to you would be in Kitwe, Zambia. If you have known people in Zambia, I can guide you to visit our office. We have visits to Zimbabwe every year to prepare our Edoofians for their intake 

I would like to share that Harare is very close to us as our founders hosted Education summits last year as well as this year. We are associated with many schools in Harare, some of them are the Nation's best schools, including *St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent High, Christ Ministries, Mablereigh Girls High, St Ignatius, St John's, Harare High, Advent Hope Academy etc*

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

29/01/24, 8:49 pm - +263 78 525 6860: *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program helps students to have minimized fee as they may pay by it . It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits  that are equivalent to physical cash  which  can be used to pay off their  fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital   workspace environment.The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional.
29/01/24, 8:59 pm - +263 78 525 6860: A good example which was once given by Mr Kunal was that wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.Hence showing EWWL program also has the  power to reduce the financial pressure on families considering the given example

We are thrilled to inform you of some exciting news! Our academic board is currently making arrangements to travel to your hometown in Zimbabwe to meet with you and discuss important matters. In preparation for this visit, Mr Gupta, the Program Director got occupied in communication with school heads and principals to ensure everything is well-coordinated.

Please accept our apologies for any inconvenience caused by their absence during this period. Rest assured, they are fully aware of your message and will respond to you promptly. We appreciate your understanding and eagerly anticipate meeting with you soon.
01/02/24, 8:44 am - Kunal: Good Morning @263785256860 @27789179114 @27627840122, 

Unfortunately yesterday your interview couldn't be completed due to Dr Abhinav getting urgently occupied. I am sure you would be delighted to know that this month Team Edoofa is travelling to Zimbabwe to meet our beloved Edoofians. Since this event would cater to over 4000+ Zimbabwean students, Dr Abhinav had an important discussion with all the School Heads and Principals across Zimbabwe who are associated with Edoofa. 

Since your application is a priority as well, I hope you would be present for your interview today with Dr Abhinav?
