You are lucky to get an opportunity to attend this counseling session this early because of your friend Munashe who is currently studying here in India because of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.  Did your friend introduce you to the parameters of this Scholarship as to How much is the  Quantum of Scholarship that we offer? (Eg. 20-50%, 40-80%, 50-100% or is it 100%)
31/01/24, 12:57 pm - +27 74 830 2354: Well, he mentioned few things to me yesterday.
31/01/24, 1:00 pm - +27 74 830 2354: Actually, he didn't tell much about the parameters of the scholarship 
He told me it's possible that I might get a 50 % scholarship and that it's possible to have a full scholarship.
31/01/24, 1:04 pm - +27 74 830 2354: This message was deleted

31/01/24, 1:28 pm - +27 74 830 2354: Other edoofian students who managed to achieve their life goals through your organization inspired me to apply for this scholarship. 
Hearing others who had lost hope in continuing on their pursue in academics and still got the chance from your program gave me lot of inspiration and hope that your program is best for people like me

I'm a committed person and cooperative. I don't give up so easily, I believe I can do whatever others can do and cannot.
One of my weaknesses is like  when doing things like debates I can be so good but, I get emotional [little bit  short tempered ], however I manage it by giving myself space from others when I'm not okay
I enjoy watching programs like NASA lost files on Dstv, and sometimes the Wildlife channels and Debates 

My parents divorced when I was 7, so I grew up with mom's parents in rural area with my brother.

1. I sat for my A level in November 2023 
Subject combination: Pure Maths, Biology and Geography 
2. I would like to take a course in: Mining / Migration and Population movements/ biotech and bioinfamatics or Urban Planning

6. My mother  have been financially supporting me in my educational journey since I was 10.
7. My mother 
8. Manicaland Province 
9. O level:

31/01/24, 2:33 pm - Kunal: As you know, higher education is a big decision that can have a significant impact on your future

31/01/24, 2:37 pm - +27 74 830 2354: Actually, right now she working as hard as she can gathering money for higher education, however it would be really great if  she get to know the structures of the fees to be paid per semester so that we can see if she can afford it or not. 
Thank you 😊

If found eligible, are you in a position to raise them?

01/02/24, 10:15 am - +27 71 959 5290: I did go through  it but as a single  parent  I don't  think I can manage  it financially it's  expensive  for me,though  I was willing to work with guys.It was my wish to give the best to my son.I really  appreciate  your  kind your time you shared with me. THANKS  a lot .
01/02/24, 10:17 am - +27 74 830 2354: Yeah we kinda go through it until or the misunderstandings of the fees got cleared when we found out the fees per semester.
I really I appreciate your offer Sir.🙂
My mom can't afford even 700 usd per semester here in Zimbabwe so it's automatically impossible 😑. 
Anyway thanks again.🙂
01/02/24, 10:23 am - Kunal: As per your understanding from the document, may I know what is the cost of education for an international student offered by Edoofa?
01/02/24, 10:32 am - +27 74 830 2354: I read a passage which said, in India fees for international students range from 6000 to 8000 usd per year but under edoofa at can be as low to 2000 to 3000 usd per year by which is fair I understand.
01/02/24, 10:41 am - Kunal: That is right
So, how are you planning to proceed for your Higher education?
01/02/24, 10:43 am - +27 74 830 2354: I don't know, I might step back to college a thing I should have done when I finished O level but it's okay 
Thank you 😊
01/02/24, 10:43 am - Kunal: Can you elaborate more on this so that I can guide you properly?
01/02/24, 10:43 am - +27 71 959 5290: That was my wish😭and Dylan  was his wish to be honest.
01/02/24, 10:44 am - +27 71 959 5290: Going for his higher level
01/02/24, 10:47 am - +27 74 830 2354: This message was deleted
01/02/24, 10:48 am - +27 74 830 2354: Actually here, when you finish O level, it's either you go college to take some courses to earn a certificate for that particular field for instant a certificate in auto-electric engineering and if you continue to 5 years you might earn a diploma and it goes like that OR you proceed to A level so you can go to university for tertiary education.
01/02/24, 10:50 am - +27 74 830 2354: So when I finished my O level I didn't wanna go to college, I thought if go to A level one day I was gonna be able to go university and pursue the field of my interest talking of which seems to be be impossible 🙃.
01/02/24, 10:51 am - Kunal: I understand, Dylan
Did you got to know about the Earn While You Learn program from the document?
01/02/24, 10:54 am - +27 74 830 2354: Yeah the document was pretty clear bout that 
They said you offer this online kinda jobs which helps students to secure their scholarship like through the money they earn
01/02/24, 10:56 am - +27 74 830 2354: Like you a student will be working enhancing their skills, so more like learn and earn
01/02/24, 11:09 am - Kunal: Students are given real-time live online projects based on digital marketing, organization management to develop soft skills like communication skills, leadership, presentation skills, teamwork, etc.during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student's performance) which wouldn't be physical cash but they can contribute to a part of their higher education fees and make their university education even more affordable.
The working hours would be flexible and they would be able to make the free time productive.
01/02/24, 11:10 am - +27 74 830 2354: Yeah I understand.
01/02/24, 11:12 am - Kunal: So, are you confident that you can earn the scholarship credits and can make your education more affordable?
01/02/24, 11:12 am - +27 74 830 2354: I don't know, if my mom was able to lm sure she would have said something.
I really appreciate how generous you are Mr Kunal.
