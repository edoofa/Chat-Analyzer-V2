25/09/23, 8:21 am - Kunal: Good day to all,

I trust this message finds you in good health.

Having received your application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I understand that you are seeking an opportunity not only to study abroad but also to build a career abroad through affordable, accessible, and employable education. However, over the last few days, it seems you haven't been able to respond, possibly due to reasons I am not aware of. This has led to an incomplete discussion regarding your scholarship application.

Often, we might have questions, queries, or doubts in our minds that we hesitate to share with others, assuming we might be judged or not understood properly. I want to assure you that at Edoofa, we are here to help you gain a comprehensive understanding of the entire process and address each and every doubt you may have.

In order to assist you in achieving an 80-100% scholarship, I am looking forward to a positive response from you soon.

Best regards,

Kunal

However, over the last few days, it seems you haven't been able to respond, possibly due to reasons I am not aware of. This has led to an incomplete discussion regarding your scholarship application.

Often, we might have questions, queries, or doubts in our minds that we hesitate to share with others, assuming we might be judged or not understood properly. I want to assure you that at Edoofa, we are here to help you gain a comprehensive understanding of the entire process and address each and every doubt you may have.

In order to assist you in achieving an 80-100% scholarship, I am looking forward to a positive response from you soon.

Best regards,

Kunal

As such we are committed to raise whatever percentage of expenses we shall be tasked to foot. We feel you could make our position more tenable if you indicated right from the beginning the extent to which you will sponsor Enock.  We have to valuate and appreciate our commitment in good time. We are always faced with uncertain factors in our economy. So it becomes hazardous to work with a sustained budget. May you kindly oblige.
30/01/24, 10:52 am - +263 71 693 6891: Sir, I have just submitted a response above. We shall appreciate your reply.

30/01/24, 11:09 am - +263 71 693 6891: Enock will respond as soon as possible.
30/01/24, 11:13 am - +263 71 693 6891: Mr Kunal, allow me to ask. Do you never consider full sponsorship in meriting cases. Surely you may be called upon to apply your highest discretion in severe cases? I am just wondering.
30/01/24, 11:27 am - Kunal: ,The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extracurricular Activities

So the universities will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of the scholarship
30/01/24, 11:52 am - +263 71 693 6891: This information is quite helpful. Thank you. I suppose it is in vain if I tasked you to quantify Enock's sponsorship (roughly) even before the Universities decide? Please sir, I'm sorry to bother you.
30/01/24, 11:53 am - +263 71 693 6891: I'm asking in your personal capacity...
30/01/24, 12:05 pm - Kunal: *The Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
30/01/24, 12:09 pm - +263 71 693 6891: Again, thank you so much Mr Kunal for enlightening us. Things are getting clearer now.

30/01/24, 1:21 pm - +263 71 650 9541: There is no one in our family working in this filed  . My teacher always encouraged me because of my efforts and performance on that  subject
30/01/24, 1:29 pm - Kunal: That is fine, Enock
So, to take forward your evaluation, I would now like you to share with me your previous qualification results i.e O level results, please?
A picture would be better

30/01/24, 1:42 pm - +263 71 650 9541: I had a low perfomance ,l would take evn a term without attending lessons due to financial problem for the payment of my tuition fees, same year the covid 19 pandemic also disturbed our learning wc resulted in closure of our  rural school

30/01/24, 2:23 pm - +263 71 693 6891: Mr Kunal, I just want to highlight something here which escaped Enock. As his backer I must mention that I did thirteen years with a reputable Commercial Bank, The Standard Chartered Bank. He is practically drawing on this experience as he is in constant communication with both you and me. I thought I should raise the matter as you have specifically called for such detail.

31/01/24, 12:19 pm - +263 71 650 9541: *How I see myself in 5 years after my course.*

I should like to have completed the ACCA course after the B Comm.

Subsequent to this I will look for job opportunities. If I am blessed with the job I am determined to spread my wings in Industry. I will need this base to facilitate furtherance of my commercial skills and broadening of networking. These two are crucial for my personal development and advancement. I will need to establish a firm financial base which will set me up in positive Business venturing. The aim here would be to increase my chances of establishing myself in entrepreunurial endeavours once I  go back my country of origin, Zimbabwe.   I also have a compelling desire to move into Tertiary Education where I will institute a College of Commerce. Here I want to enrol potential candidates  who will follow in my footsteps. In broadening this scope I will introduce an Institution which will impart Career Guidance and Counselling. I find that the two fields will be viable particularly as I look  at the severe lack of such presently in my country.

*How being Edoofian can enable me to achieve my career goals.*

In light of the preceding passage, I hasten to pronounce that there are veritable benefits that will accrue to me. Namely these are:

...wide exposure.
...enhanced vision
...possible essential link with Edoo affiliates
...sharpened mental vision and focus
...crucial job opportunities.

I find I need not expand on the above as they are sufficiently self-explanatory.
31/01/24, 12:19 pm - Kunal: It is good to hear from you
31/01/24, 12:19 pm - Kunal: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time. I believe you will be researching more about the course in detail.

As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education  which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
31/01/24, 1:48 pm - +263 71 650 9541: I don't have any knowledge about their tuition fees yet .
31/01/24, 2:03 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
31/01/24, 2:03 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 2:13 pm - +263 71 650 9541: My relatives are all offline , hopefully they will get to you as soon as they come online
31/01/24, 2:14 pm - Kunal: That is fine
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.
And do you know how that is done?
31/01/24, 2:21 pm - +263 71 650 9541: Amazing! 
May you please share with me how how it is done.
31/01/24, 2:27 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
31/01/24, 2:27 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to Become an all-rounder in the Ever-changing Professional World by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to Network like a Boss by Ms Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an Employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s Never Too Late to Pursue Your Passion: My Journey from Real Estate to Entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the Science of Personal Branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
31/01/24, 2:27 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 3:05 pm - +263 71 650 9541: I really appreciate this program is good  in helping students pay for the fees. It is also crucial because it caries with it some benefits after completing the courses such as ..
Gaining skills necessary for digital workplace environment named above.

It also help boost overal growth of a student and for him to keep up with changing market strategy and needs, converting an individual into a market ready professional .This is for more that help but broadening student's knowledge and skills .
Lastly ,offering opportunities to start professional journey in  sectors they worked through EWYL a better way for us to learn and grasp practical knowledge in disguise.
31/01/24, 3:05 pm - Kunal: Indeed,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. _This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families?
31/01/24, 3:05 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 3:07 pm - +263 71 650 9541: May l ask you if the option is for those not only able or for everyone beacuse they are beneficial to everyone.
31/01/24, 3:10 pm - +263 71 650 9541: Ofcourse ,they are more beneficial and wish everyone would use this way even those able to raise money to cover the costs.
31/01/24, 3:14 pm - +263 71 650 9541: Yeah ,this program is so good for me .
31/01/24, 3:14 pm - Kunal: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
31/01/24, 3:20 pm - +263 71 650 9541: From my own perspective ,the forth section is more significant.
31/01/24, 3:24 pm - +263 71 650 9541: I may ask if we can proceed with our session tomorrow sir .
31/01/24, 3:33 pm - Kunal: May I know what happened, Enock?
31/01/24, 5:10 pm - Kunal: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for a Board Meeting. Let us connect at 6:15 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenge with the schedule.

31/01/24, 7:39 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
31/01/24, 7:43 pm - +263 71 650 9541: My relatives @Dad and @H Chiweshe  l added recently
31/01/24, 7:43 pm - Kunal: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
31/01/24, 7:48 pm - +263 71 650 9541: My parents feel great and they have been praying for me to get the opportunity to study abroad.
31/01/24, 7:49 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at even a greater pace, as you will be transformed to a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family thereby yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle free life to your parents.
31/01/24, 7:49 pm - Kunal: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
31/01/24, 7:54 pm - +263 71 650 9541: You may inform me about other requirements so as to get them ready.
31/01/24, 7:55 pm - +263 71 650 9541: Ok ,when dou you expect me to submit the above requirements.
31/01/24, 7:58 pm - Kunal: Let me guide you ahead
31/01/24, 7:58 pm - Kunal: When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
31/01/24, 7:58 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 8:03 pm - +263 71 650 9541: That is understandable.  When is the enrollment fee paid.
31/01/24, 8:04 pm - Kunal: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
31/01/24, 8:04 pm - Kunal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
31/01/24, 8:08 pm - +263 71 650 9541: Thanks for coming up with  this payment plan and it is good for me too.
31/01/24, 8:10 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 8:15 pm - +263 71 650 9541: We are now on stage 2
31/01/24, 8:16 pm - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
31/01/24, 8:19 pm - +263 71 650 9541: Yes you may  explain .
31/01/24, 8:21 pm - Kunal: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
31/01/24, 8:21 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
31/01/24, 8:25 pm - +263 71 650 9541: Its clear now and l understand the process.
31/01/24, 8:25 pm - Kunal: Alright Enock
31/01/24, 8:25 pm - Kunal: We have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
31/01/24, 8:26 pm - Kunal: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*

*Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.
