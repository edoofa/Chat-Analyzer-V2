13/01/24, 10:52 am - Kunal: Noted
Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
13/01/24, 10:55 am - +263 78 711 4956: I understand
13/01/24, 10:55 am - +263 78 711 4956: I will do my best
13/01/24, 11:07 am - Kunal: May I know with your interests in Medical field, why didn't you opt for Physics at A level?
13/01/24, 11:13 am - +263 78 711 4956: I didn't opt for physics at A level because l thought that MBC was the combination that would help accomplish my dreams
13/01/24, 11:25 am - Kunal: I do understand , Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. There fore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics in their A level mandatorily.
13/01/24, 11:27 am - +263 78 711 4956: I understand
13/01/24, 11:48 am - Kunal: Since you are not having Physics, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine, but considering your interest and passion in the field there are courses from Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help you fulfil your dreams of working in this field

It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
24/01/24, 7:12 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to Become an all-rounder in the Ever-changing Professional World by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to Network like a Boss by Ms Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an Employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu

24/01/24, 7:23 pm - +263 78 711 4956: This sounds interesting
24/01/24, 7:23 pm - Kunal: Indeed,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. _This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families?
24/01/24, 7:23 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 7:25 pm - +263 78 711 4956: The EWYLP does not affect study time or school lessons right ??
24/01/24, 7:26 pm - +263 78 711 4956: Is a student when to do the EWYLP  would they also have to get a visa themselves and pay for airfare, accommodation etc
24/01/24, 7:27 pm - Kunal: It's important to note that the work component in programs like this is typically structured to be manageable, so it doesn't overwhelm students or interfere with their studies. Additionally, Edoofa is committed to providing the necessary support and guidance to ensure that students can successfully balance work and academics. However, I'd like to emphasize that the "Earn While You Learn" program, is designed to strike a balance between work and study, ultimately benefiting the student in several ways
24/01/24, 7:27 pm - +263 78 711 4956: I understand
24/01/24, 7:28 pm - +263 78 711 4956: So l can opt for the EWYLP when l don't get the scholarship
24/01/24, 7:29 pm - Kunal: No dear, the EWYL program is an additional benefit after the scholarship offered to the Edoofians
24/01/24, 7:29 pm - +263 78 711 4956: Oh okay
24/01/24, 7:29 pm - Kunal: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
24/01/24, 7:29 pm - +263 78 711 4956: I must have misunderstood
24/01/24, 7:30 pm - Kunal: That is completely fine dear
24/01/24, 7:34 pm - +263 78 711 4956: Number 4 and 3, 1
24/01/24, 7:34 pm - +263 78 711 4956: We're significant
24/01/24, 7:34 pm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education, services and guidance
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

24/01/24, 7:34 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
24/01/24, 7:35 pm - +263 78 711 4956: My mom
24/01/24, 7:35 pm - +263 78 711 4956: She's the only one there
24/01/24, 7:35 pm - +263 78 711 4956: Honestly
24/01/24, 7:36 pm - Kunal: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
24/01/24, 7:38 pm - +263 78 711 4956: I will discuss all this with my mom surely
24/01/24, 7:38 pm - +263 78 711 4956: My family is proud and happy about my decision to study overseas
24/01/24, 7:39 pm - +263 78 711 4956: They are alittle concerned about my safety since l am a girl child
24/01/24, 7:39 pm - Kunal: Being a parent, the concern regarding the welfare and personal development of your child is absolutely understandable. 

To give a glimpse, we have a community of more than 2500 Zimbabweans with  300+ associate schools from Zimbabwe with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, and parents, who have been bringing success stories of Edoofians for the past 14+ years due to the kind of foster and care that we provide throughout their course!

With UGC-approved Universities whose degrees are Globally accredited, and which have all security and healthcare facilities including counselling departments, Edoofians are exposed to a conducive environment that motivates them to focus on their career and achieve their dreams. There are Zimbabwean Communities at Every University so no child will feel lonely. Moreover, our Admission Team, EWYL(Earn While You Learn) mentor and counsellor of a student will be available to him/her throughout the course. At any point, if the student or parent needs assistance we will be readily accessible. This is the reason why Edoofa is known as a *Higher Education Concierge!*

The Universities are strict in terms of the welfare of children. Being in Zimbabwe itself, your parents will be able to track the happenings, academic performance, and University details

*"Education is the key to unlock the golden door of freedom." - George Washington Carver*

With a positive note, I am here to resume the session
Shall we proceed?
25/01/24, 10:57 am - +263 77 238 7604: Morning
25/01/24, 10:58 am - +263 77 238 7604: Precious is at school
25/01/24, 11:12 am - Kunal: I understand
In the meantime, may I know if you can take part?
25/01/24, 11:14 am - +263 77 238 7604: Uuuuuhhhh yaaaah

25/01/24, 11:18 am - +263 77 238 7604: Meaning is she allowed to work in lndia after schooling
25/01/24, 11:19 am - Kunal: Let me tell you that Edoofa doesn’t offer jobs directly to students as of now. We are preparing students throughout the course and through the Earn While You Learn Program so that they gain employability skills and get transformed into employable and professional citizens of the era!
They will be working on different platforms which will enhance their communication, leadership, team management and other professional skills. 

 Once they complete they are already having hands-on experience on various projects and real-life situations and it would be much easier for them to be employable and receive jobs internationally
25/01/24, 6:12 pm - +263 78 711 4956: Okay l understand now
25/01/24, 6:14 pm - Kunal: Let us connect at *9:30 am CAT Monday to resume your session *(In case you have any challenges, please let me know the time you will be available, and we will schedule accordingly)*

Please note that your participation and activeness is an important parameters of evaluation. 

*In case the student is having lessons, the parents can also take part in the session*

Stay Blessed!
25/01/24, 6:24 pm - +263 78 711 4956: Ok
29/01/24, 9:55 am - Kunal: ,Good Morning,

*“If you believe it’ll work out, you’ll see opportunities. If you don’t believe it’ll work out, you’ll see obstacles.” ―Wayne Dyer*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
29/01/24, 10:35 pm - +263 78 711 4956: Yes
30/01/24, 7:56 am - Kunal: Good morning, Precious
How are you doing?
30/01/24, 8:49 am - +263 77 238 7604: Morning
30/01/24, 8:49 am - +263 77 238 7604: She is at school

In the meantime, shall we proceed?
30/01/24, 9:49 am - Kunal: Are we connected?
30/01/24, 1:16 pm - +263 77 238 7604: Yes
30/01/24, 1:16 pm - Kunal: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
30/01/24, 8:04 pm - +263 78 711 4956: Yes l know about these requirements
31/01/24, 11:57 am - Kunal: Good morning, Precious
How are you doing?
31/01/24, 12:07 pm - +263 77 238 7604: Latter she is at school
31/01/24, 12:07 pm - Kunal: Can you participate, Mrs Helen?
31/01/24, 12:14 pm - +263 77 238 7604: Yes if the questions are simple and directed to me
31/01/24, 12:14 pm - Kunal: Yes please
31/01/24, 12:14 pm - Kunal: When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
31/01/24, 12:15 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 9:50 am - Kunal: Good morning to you all
How are you doing?
01/02/24, 5:31 pm - Kunal: This message was deleted
01/02/24, 5:33 pm - +263 78 711 4956: Hie
01/02/24, 5:33 pm - +263 78 711 4956: I am bavk
01/02/24, 5:34 pm - +263 78 711 4956: Back
01/02/24, 5:34 pm - Kunal: Please address this
01/02/24, 5:34 pm - +263 78 711 4956: Okay let me read it
01/02/24, 5:35 pm - +263 78 711 4956: Yes inform me
01/02/24, 5:36 pm - Kunal: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.

The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
01/02/24, 5:36 pm - Kunal: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
01/02/24, 5:36 pm - Kunal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
01/02/24, 5:38 pm - +263 78 711 4956: Ok l understand
01/02/24, 5:38 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 5:39 pm - +263 78 711 4956: Personalized counseling session and eligibility check
01/02/24, 5:42 pm - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
01/02/24, 5:43 pm - +263 78 711 4956: Yes
01/02/24, 5:43 pm - Kunal: *Step 5:* After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
01/02/24, 5:43 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
01/02/24, 5:43 pm - +263 78 711 4956: We have done 4and 3??
01/02/24, 5:44 pm - Kunal: No dear, we have only done the first stage
01/02/24, 5:45 pm - +263 78 711 4956: I am clear with the process now
01/02/24, 5:45 pm - +263 78 711 4956: Oh okay 👌
01/02/24, 5:45 pm - +263 78 711 4956: I was confused
01/02/24, 5:45 pm - Kunal: We have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
01/02/24, 5:45 pm - Kunal: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*

*Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.
