In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
31/01/24, 5:02 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 5:02 pm - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
31/01/24, 5:09 pm - Kunal: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for a Board Meeting. Let us connect at 6:15 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenge with the schedule. 

Meanwhile you can go through our Social Media pages to learn more about the experiences of Edoofians and the program!

01/02/24, 10:13 am - +27 78 333 2724: Thank you Mr Kunal
01/02/24, 10:18 am - Kunal: Good to hear that
01/02/24, 10:18 am - Kunal: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
01/02/24, 10:18 am - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to Become an all-rounder in the Ever-changing Professional World by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to Network like a Boss by Ms Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an Employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s Never Too Late to Pursue Your Passion: My Journey from Real Estate to Entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the Science of Personal Branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
01/02/24, 10:18 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 10:24 am - +263 71 296 2605: yes I will be benefiting from the Earn while you learn program... I will be gaining some working experience as well as reduce the fees costs
01/02/24, 10:24 am - Kunal: Indeed,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. _This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families?
01/02/24, 10:24 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 10:27 am - +263 71 296 2605: yes I do realize how helpful the EWYL might be to me and my family
01/02/24, 10:28 am - +263 71 296 2605: ok ok that's great thank you.. I clearly understand
01/02/24, 10:33 am - +27 78 333 2724: We understand clearly and how profitable this programme is for the future of my son and many more people around the world,Thank you so much for such a program
01/02/24, 10:41 am - Kunal: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
01/02/24, 10:44 am - +263 71 296 2605: 4.*Higher Education Concierge*
01/02/24, 10:45 am - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education, services and guidance
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

01/02/24, 10:45 am - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
01/02/24, 10:48 am - +263 71 296 2605: my father will be helping me with the remaining fee after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program
01/02/24, 10:50 am - Kunal: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
01/02/24, 10:54 am - +263 71 296 2605: yes I will discuss everything with them, they are all proud and happy about it and ready to sacrifice for me to study abroad
01/02/24, 10:56 am - +263 71 296 2605: ok thank you Mr Kunal...So you will help me get to know the proceedings
01/02/24, 10:58 am - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at even a greater pace, as you will be transformed to a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family thereby yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle free life to your parents.
01/02/24, 10:58 am - Kunal: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
01/02/24, 11:01 am - +263 71 296 2605: I know that studying Internationally will help brighten my future to a greater extent and that's why I'm very much interested
01/02/24, 11:04 am - +263 71 296 2605: no I don't not know about  other requirements, can u please help me by telling me all the requirements and how to apply
01/02/24, 11:07 am - Kunal: When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
01/02/24, 11:08 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 11:10 am - +263 71 296 2605: ok ok thank you Sir
01/02/24, 11:10 am - Kunal: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
01/02/24, 11:10 am - Kunal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
01/02/24, 11:13 am - +263 71 296 2605: thank you sir.. So how do I apply
01/02/24, 11:13 am - Kunal: Let me guide you
01/02/24, 11:13 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 11:13 am - +263 71 296 2605: thank you
01/02/24, 11:16 am - +263 71 296 2605: I think now we have covered upto stage 2..Is it so??
01/02/24, 11:16 am - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
01/02/24, 11:17 am - +263 71 296 2605: yes you can explain
01/02/24, 11:19 am - +263 71 296 2605: so how can I proceed to other stages
01/02/24, 11:24 am - Kunal: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
01/02/24, 11:24 am - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
01/02/24, 11:28 am - +263 71 296 2605: thank you sir, I'm clear with the process
01/02/24, 11:38 am - Kunal: Alright Dylan
We have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
01/02/24, 11:38 am - Kunal: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*

*Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

01/02/24, 5:40 pm - +263 71 296 2605: Stay Blessed as well
02/02/24, 1:33 pm - Kunal: Greetings to you all

Congratulations on clearing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program I hope you have learned about the program better through the previous sessions. Now, I will guide you to the most important *Eligibility check stage* after addressing your questions. 

Are you ready for the same?
02/02/24, 1:35 pm - +263 71 296 2605: yes I have learnt a lot and I'm ready for the next stage
02/02/24, 1:39 pm - Kunal: It is good to hear that
Did you manage to discuss the Edoofa Program with your family, please?
02/02/24, 1:42 pm - +263 71 296 2605: yes we did discuss about it and  we could really appreciate it if I'm part of the program since it benefits the family as a whole
02/02/24, 1:42 pm - Kunal: Good to know, can you provide a summary of your family discussions regarding the Edoofa Scholarship Program and share their thoughts after learning more about the program?
02/02/24, 1:48 pm - +263 71 296 2605: we talked about how the Edoofa Scholarship Program and how it will help us with paying 50-100% of my varsity fees,my parents were please since it reduces the pressure on there should and also how it will help me get quality education as well as help me find a good job,we were all amazed
02/02/24, 1:49 pm - Kunal: Excellent, well it seems that you took your family through the entire conversation which we did during your counselling session! May I know if your family has any questions for me?
02/02/24, 1:52 pm - +263 71 296 2605: Yah,they would like to know if you the Program is going to cater for the Visa and the Flight costs
02/02/24, 1:58 pm - Kunal: If you understand the concept of International Education, the finances that play a major role is not visa fee or flight ticket because visa fee is given once in the whole program and the flight ticket is taken a limited number of times,maybe twice or once,because international students don't often travel back to their country.

They look forward to settling down and making sure education is not hampered.So they learn and do internships at breaks.But still students can definitely visit their family during holidays and spend time with them.

But I personally have seen that students don't travel often,so considering these the traveling fee
*(air fare :-around $400,Visa fee:-$83) is to be borne by the student* which is mostly a one time investment.
02/02/24, 2:00 pm - +263 71 296 2605: ok, thank you Mr Kunal now I clearly understand

that's all they wanted to know, I think we can proceed
02/02/24, 2:04 pm - Kunal: That is fine, 

May I know the thoughts and opinions of your family regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
02/02/24, 2:05 pm - +263 71 296 2605: from the discussion we had, they said they are going to support me all the way
02/02/24, 2:05 pm - Kunal: I appreciate the willingness of your family to invest in your career,
02/02/24, 2:06 pm - Kunal: Dylan, Before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me?
