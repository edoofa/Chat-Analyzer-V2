You have been the best mentor any person could ask for and you taking a step back from being my mentor is really heartbreaking,  I come to you with a heavy heart, I face many challenges and others to help my family I had to look for a part-time job promoting my absence from our weekly sessions thereby holding any progress, I barely have time to be online not that I don't want to participate but I'm busy everyday from 0600 to 2100 and when I get back home I will be tired.....I'm kindly asking if you could reconsider on your decision and we work out how we can progress, your help will be appreciated thank you
77 - 31 Jan 2024 02:09PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Good Afternoon Student, I trust this message finds you well. Today, I want to take a moment to celebrate the exceptional bond that has been fostered between you and your former mentor, Ms. Jasmine. We truly appreciate the positive impact she has had on your journey with us.  As the Head of the Department, I want to assure you that it is our top priority to ensure a smooth transition for you and to maintain the momentum of your learning and growth. While a new mentor has not been assigned just yet, I want to assure you that efforts are actively underway to identify a suitable mentor who aligns with your goals and aspirations.  In the spirit of ensuring that your learning and growth never stop, I am personally taking the initiative to share this Wednesday's lesson with you as I believe it's crucial to maintain the continuity of your education, and I am excited to contribute to your ongoing development.  In the meantime, if you have any immediate questions or concerns or if there's anything specific you'd like assistance with, feel free to reach out to me. We are here to support you every step of the way.

You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.

225 - 02 Feb 2024 04:20PM - Ashi Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.  Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.

Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.  As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
227 - 02 Feb 2024 04:24PM - +260 760061219: Yes I am please.
228 - 02 Feb 2024 04:25PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.  In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
229 - 02 Feb 2024 04:25PM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
239 - 02 Feb 2024 04:31PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course.  Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
240 - 02 Feb 2024 04:32PM - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful.  Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.

Entrepreneurs are a rare species.Even in innovative_driven economies only 1-2% of the workforce stars a business in any given year .Yet entrepreneurs  ,particularly innovative entrepreneurs ,are vital to the competitiveness of the economy . Entrepreneurship is important to economic development. The benefits yo society will be greater in economies where entrepreneurs can operate flexible  develop their ideas and reap the rewards . Entrepreneurs respond to high regulatory barriers by moving to more innovative - friendly countries or by turning from productive activities to non-wealth -creating activities. Entrepreneurs are equally  ,if not more important when the economy is doing badly .When unemployment is high and the economy is contracting or stagnating ,dynamic entrepreneurship could help turn the economy around. By developing novel products new firms can boost demand ,which could inturn create new job opportunities and reduce unemployment. Entrepreneurs have positive employment effects and in the short and longterm and negative effects in the medium term

271 - 02 Feb 2024 03:46PM - Ashi Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.  Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
272 - 02 Feb 2024 03:46PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.  As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
273 - 02 Feb 2024 03:52PM - +263 71 907 9653: Yeah
274 - 02 Feb 2024 04:21PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.  In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
275 - 02 Feb 2024 04:21PM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
276 - 02 Feb 2024 04:25PM - +263 71 907 9653: Yeah
277 - 02 Feb 2024 04:25PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
278 - 02 Feb 2024 04:25PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
290 - 02 Feb 2024 04:35PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you @263719079653

There is a need for new energy infrastructure and improved efficiency. As an engineer, I could work on developing renewable energy sources, improving the efficiency of existing power plants, and increasing access to electricity in rural areas.Recently there's a 132kV line power substation which is being constructed at Bikita Minerals which aims total electrification of the Bikita Mine and surrounding areas.As an Electrical Engineer, I would play an important role in transmission and distribution of electricity as per each area's power consumption. Considering my surrounding mining area in which the mine is expanding technologically, there would be need for effective control systems for geocrushers,controling the conveyer belts and the Dense Media Separator.This would help to reduce costs, create jobs, and spur economic growth. The energy sector has great potential for positive change, and I would be proud to contribute to that effort.

I am passionate about finding solutions to global challenges, and I believe that Delta's mission aligns with my values. I am confident that my skills and experience would be a valuable asset to the company, and I would be excited to work on their cutting-edge technologies. In addition, Delta has a strong focus on employee development, which is important to me. I believe that I would be able to grow and develop my skills at Delta, while also contributing to the company's success. For all of these reasons, I believe that Delta is the perfect company for me to pursue my career goals.
167 - 02 Feb 2024 01:45AM - +263 78 589 4003: Electrical systems and electronics are both closely related, but there are some key differences between them. In simple terms, electrical systems deal with the flow of electricity, while electronics involve the use of electronic components to create or control electric signals. Electrical systems include things like power generation and transmission, while electronics include things like computers, phones, and medical equipment. In general, electrical systems are more about large-scale systems that move electricity from one place to another, while electronics are more about the control and manipulation of electricity. They often work together to create useful devices and systems. Electrical systems are often described as ""heavy current"" systems because they deal with large amounts of electricity. In contrast, electronics are often described as ""low current"" systems because they handle smaller amounts of electricity. Electrical systems typically have a lot of power flowing through them, while electronic systems have a lot of information flowing through them. Electrical systems are about moving energy, while electronic systems are about processing information.
168 - 02 Feb 2024 06:32AM - +263 78 589 4003: A capacitor is a device that stores electrical energy and then releases it when needed. It's made up of two metal plates separated by an insulating material called a dielectric. When a voltage is applied to the plates, an electric field is created between them. This field stores energy in the form of an electric charge. When the voltage is removed, the stored energy is released and can be used to power other devices. This process is called ""charging"" and ""discharging"" the capacitor. Capacitors are used in a variety of devices, from radios to computers, to help smooth out power fluctuations and improve performance.To elaborate further, there are different types of capacitors with different properties. Some are designed to store a lot of energy, while others are designed to release it quickly. Some are designed to work with high voltages, while others are designed to work with low voltages. There are also different types of dielectrics, including ceramic, plastic, and air. The properties of the dielectric affect how quickly the capacitor can charge and discharge. The size and shape of the plates also affect how the capacitor works.

140 - 01 Feb 2024 07:41PM - +263 77 354 0447: Question 4  Programming is the process of using a programming language to give a computer instructions on how to perform a specific task. It's a the same as giving instructions to a robot. The programmer writes code in a specific programming language, and the computer interprets that code and performs the task pertainingto that specific code. A programming language is a set of instructions that the computer understands and is able to intepret. There are many different programming languages, but they all share some common features. Each language has a specific syntax, or set of rules, that must be followed in order for the code to be executed correctly. The computer reads the code and executes each instruction one by one.  The programming languages include the following, which are called a low-level language and high level language. The low level languages are very close to the machine code that a computer understands. They're quite difficult to understand for humans, but they're very fast for a computer to execute. Some examples of low-level languages are Assembly and Machine Code. On the other end, we have high-level languages. These are designed to be easy for humans to understand and use. They use simple, human-readable commands, like ""if/then"" statements and ""for"" loops. Some examples of high-level languages python, pascal etc

143 - 02 Feb 2024 07:14AM - +263 77 354 0447: Question 5  Compiler converts high level language into machine code for the computer to execute whereas an interpreter converts low level language into machine code. A compiler translated the whole program and executes it whereas an interpreter reads line by line and executes line by line. A compiler is fast during program executes  whereas an interpreter is slow during program executes due to line by line execution. Although compiler translates the whole program at once it makes it difficult to debug for errors  and that then makes an interpreter easy to debug for errors since the line of code will be identified during its translations These are the main translators that ate used in programming languages.

87 - 02 Feb 2024 11:22AM - +263 77 799 6606: One thing l choose eden was that l got a friend of mine who is doing medicine in zambia and his father is a doctor in Namibia and was much certain that after my degree will follow where he will be working since his father will be linking him and will simply follow his footsteps
88 - 02 Feb 2024 11:24AM - +263 77 799 6606: I had to force myself from the start since l heard that in order for one to do medicine should be doing maths physics biology and chemistry at the same time from some of my friends before l even started applying

171 - 02 Feb 2024 04:10PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that let me help you with it. As you are aware, we are currently in February 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
172 - 02 Feb 2024 04:10PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
173 - 02 Feb 2024 04:10PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
174 - 02 Feb 2024 04:20PM - +263 71 905 3634: Yes l understand that
175 - 02 Feb 2024 05:21PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
176 - 02 Feb 2024 05:21PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
177 - 02 Feb 2024 05:21PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
178 - 02 Feb 2024 05:27PM - +263 71 905 3634: I am seeing it. So still what is the nature of the Edoofa Financial Secure plan

The numbers cover from the full university fees before and after scholarship, all the facets of Edoofa secure plan and the EWYL.  Good day
260 - 02 Feb 2024 12:11PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning @263779726862! I hope you are doing well. I understand that you want to catch a grasp of how the finances of Casper's education are going to look like. Let me help you with it.
261 - 02 Feb 2024 12:11PM - Dev Edoofa: Normally, in India, the cost of education ranges from $6000-$8000. Edoofa with it's experience of 15 years in the field of education has able to cut the expenses to $2000-$3000 with the help of scholarships for the students.
262 - 02 Feb 2024 12:11PM - Dev Edoofa: If you go through the Edoofa Secure Plan, you will notice that our main purpose in designing this plan is to help the parents/guardians prepare for the finances beforehand, so that students' further academic journey in India is not affected. In this plan, the parents are required to deposit $150 each month for the next 10 months, i.e, November, so that they are able to save $1500 at the end of November, to ensure that at the time of the admission process (starts from August 2024 till November 2024), students can reserve the seat in the universities and parents/guardians are not burdened with the sudden demand of the registration fees to reserve the seat. At the time of registration for admission (August 2024), the student will be required to pay $1000. Now, with the Edoofa Secure Plan, you would have already saved this amount, which will be used to pay the registration fees. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university.
263 - 02 Feb 2024 12:12PM - Dev Edoofa: In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.

223 - 02 Feb 2024 01:10PM - Dev Edoofa: With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?

227 - 02 Feb 2024 05:16PM - Dev Edoofa: I understand Mr. and Mrs. Mapengo!
228 - 02 Feb 2024 05:18PM - Dev Edoofa: In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
229 - 02 Feb 2024 05:18PM - Dev Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
230 - 02 Feb 2024 05:18PM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well.
231 - 02 Feb 2024 05:19PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now.",No,Yes

262 - 01 Feb 2024 05:49PM - Dev Edoofa: @263773818114, if you fail to pay $150 for a specific month, then you will have to pay the next payment with a penalty that is mentioned against the month in the document and you will not be able to avail the $150 waiver.  Now, if you don't want to miss out on the waiver then you will have to $300 to make up for the missed month in the following month. By doing this, you will be able to avail the waiver.

But at the same time, @263772385097, you need to understand that investments do not ensure that you are going to be able to prepare for Tanatswa's higher education. There is always uncertainty in investments. You may or may not earn a huge amount. And it may take a lot of time as well. But with a secure plan, you are investing in education. It is best in education as you are investing in the future of Tanatswa.  Also, many kinds of unforeseen circumstances may arise in our daily lives, which may lead to some kind of financial crisis. That is why this Financial Secure Plan was designed to ensure that at the time of admission/reserving seats at the universities, you will not have to worry about that, as you would have saved with us. This plan will not only help you at the time of admission but help you prepare for the future finances of Tanatswa's higher education here in India.",No,No

Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams.

Challenges that led to my failure to secure a seat on time. #The second  acceptance letter we received had BSc in Biochemistry after we requested for a change through email. In contrast the final acceptance letter we received had BSc in Chemistry again .I as parent didn't want to pay for what my daughter didn't prefer. After making a follow up on why BSc in Chemistry instead of BSc in Biochemistry requested for  the office took time to respond and days were nearing to the deadline. Following your conversation with Tapiwa you mentioned that Med Lab Technology and Microbiology are better than Biochemistry. In our earlier communication you understood that Tapiwa had passion on Medicine which you said she could not take since she does not have Physics. From further clarity by you recently she observed that Med Lab and Microbiology may drive her clover to her passion. Would you please allow her for Med Lab ? Or Microbiology if possible.  I did not want to pay for a course she had no passion on. #On the other hand my project which I expected to give me money in time could not do so up to now. 2.Plans moving forward on studying abroad.  The project is about to yield fruits now and payment may be done any time if possible to pay after first deadline 3.How you can help. My request is for you and your office to accept the request made above and to make payment even cheaper, flexible and slightly extending the payment gap. Once you accept change of course and pardon me for failure to meet deadline , I promise to pay the money and meet the deadline of February. I promise that for sure.

Considering the same, I wanted to reach out to you, share a gentle reminder, and try to understand if you have been able to make the payment of your fee by now so that we can update the academic board and the university officials accordingly?

47 - 02 Feb 2024 09:24AM - +263 71 257 6605: Morning team. As I always highlight in all communications that Zimbabwe is currently a dead country interms of economic perfomance and it's making it very difficult to raise funds that are required. Consider visa, travel, passport and all that requires funding
48 - 02 Feb 2024 11:00AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I completely understand the economic challenges in Zimbabwe. It's indeed a tough situation. However, consider this as an investment in your future. While the initial expenses for visas, travel, and passports may seem daunting, the education abroad is a one-time sacrifice that has the potential to change the trajectory of your family's life forever. We've seen students from the University of Zimbabwe struggling even after their masters, working at gas stations or selling SIM cards on the streets. A move abroad for education can open up opportunities that may not be easily available in the current economic climate.  Nut now if you stay there and invest on your education in Zimbabwe then in coming years there will be no way out and it would be very difficult to put bread on table for your family.",No,No

3 hr 36 mins","124 - 02 Feb 2024 10:03AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
125 - 02 Feb 2024 10:04AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,  1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum 2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum 3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
126 - 02 Feb 2024 10:04AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee that you pay will be subtracted from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.  *Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*

21 - 02 Feb 2024 10:06AM - +263 78 275 9892: From the flight ticket ,we can't afford it
22 - 02 Feb 2024 10:17AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Consider that the fare is a one-time expense  for studying abroad as you travel once abroad, typically ranging around $400 to $550 and you have months to save it . This cost is notably lower compared to the cumulative expenses incurred when studying locally. If you calculate the daily commuting expenses, even at a modest rate of $5 - $9 per day for 200-250 days in a year, the total easily surpasses $1000-$1400. Opting for education abroad not only provides a unique global experience but also proves to be more economical in terms of daily commuting costs.
23 - 02 Feb 2024 10:19AM - +263 78 275 9892: It expensive ,my father is the one who was earning for the family
24 - 02 Feb 2024 01:31PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Have you discussed these calculations with him? It's crucial to walk him through the numbers. If he considers the long-term perspective, he'll realize that the fees he'll be paying for you to study in Zimbabwe may surpass the costs associated with your course in India. Additionally, employment opportunities are limited in Zimbabwe, Even for top university in Zimbabwe like UZ graduates who often find themselves selling SIM cards on the streets or working at gas stations due to the education quality and job scarcity. There's also the uncertainty of completing the course on time, given the history of students facing delays due to riots or political influences. When you calculate the potential additional costs for these extra years, the total expense of completing a degree in Zimbabwe could be three times more than studying in India.

52 - 02 Feb 2024 02:51PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Medical Laboratory Technology (MLT) is closely related to medicine and plays a crucial role in the field of healthcare. MLT professionals are responsible for performing laboratory tests that aid in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases. Their work contributes valuable information that helps physicians make informed decisions about a patient's health.  Here's how MLT is related to medicine and the career options it opens up in hospitals:  Diagnostic Support: MLT professionals work with various medical specimens such as blood, urine, and tissues to conduct laboratory tests. The results of these tests provide critical information to physicians for diagnosing illnesses and determining appropriate treatment plans.  Pathology Services: In hospitals, MLT professionals are often part of the pathology department. They analyze samples to identify abnormalities, infections, or other health issues. This information is fundamental for understanding the nature of diseases.  Blood Banking: MLT experts are involved in blood banking, ensuring the safety and compatibility of blood transfusions. They perform tests to identify blood types, screen for infectious diseases, and ensure the quality of donated blood.  Microbiology and Virology: MLT professionals work in microbiology and virology laboratories, where they study microorganisms and viruses. This is crucial for identifying infectious diseases and implementing appropriate control measures.  Clinical Research: MLT experts may also contribute to clinical research by conducting experiments, analyzing data, and assisting in the development of new diagnostic techniques and treatments.  Quality Control: Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of laboratory tests is vital. MLT professionals may be involved in quality control processes to maintain high standards in laboratory testing.  Hospital Administration: MLT professionals may take on administrative roles in hospital laboratories, overseeing laboratory operations, managing staff, and ensuring compliance with regulations.  In summary, a career in MLT not only supports the medical field by providing essential diagnostic information but also opens up various opportunities within hospitals, research institutions, and healthcare settings.

64 - 02 Feb 2024 01:55PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counseling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $1600-$2300 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program *as we recommended your application for a higher quantum of scholarship.* Congratulations on securing the same.

112 - 02 Feb 2024 02:52PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*  Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?

116 - 02 Feb 2024 03:05PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,  1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum 2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum 3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000  This means this registration fee that you pay will be subtracted from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.  *Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
117 - 02 Feb 2024 03:16PM - +263 77 673 7538: Food and accomodation is optional right??

67 - 02 Feb 2024 03:14PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Medical Lab Technology) and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
68 - 02 Feb 2024 03:15PM - +263 71 806 8210: Yes the information is quite TRUE
69 - 02 Feb 2024 03:15PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*  Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
70 - 02 Feb 2024 03:17PM - +263 71 806 8210: Yes I see still remember the registration fee wc is needed
71 - 02 Feb 2024 03:37PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
72 - 02 Feb 2024 03:37PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counseling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program *as we recommended your application for a higher quantum of scholarship.* Congratulations on the same. Now, let us assume,
73 - 02 Feb 2024 03:37PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum 2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship) 3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum  *Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*  4. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
74 - 02 Feb 2024 03:37PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education ($1650-$1000= $650) and this remaining fee of $650 is supposed to be paid within 3 days of arrival.  *Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*

59 - 02 Feb 2024 10:43AM - +263 77 758 1943: Ofcourse I think there are a lot of reasons behind that and these maybe that parents or the student fails to afford for higher education  and maybe the student is not committed to the extent that her focus and goals change and maybe starts focusing on irrelevant staff and sometimes there would be a crisis at home that make parents change their mindset in regard to education as they feel that its better to sideline the issue of higher education for the child and instead solve the crisis at home etc

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.

Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of tomorrow.
129 - 02 Feb 2024 06:53PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
130 - 02 Feb 2024 06:53PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.  The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students‚Äô skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to¬†be¬†considered.

However, something must have brought that thought into your mind, am I correct? I was wondering and I could not quite comprehend, hence I am just asking out of curiosity so that we can be on the same here. I hope you are understanding?
118 - 02 Feb 2024 11:58AM - +263 77 749 1315: Good morning Ms Siddhi. That wasn't my thought but one of the family members asked me that question.

121 - 02 Feb 2024 01:17PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. I know you did not have any intentions to imply that this situation might happen. I only happened to be curious as to how your thought process worked.  To answer your query, in a situation where the student is not anymore alive to attend the university, I am afraid that according to the university the amount will be non-refundable. This is because once she pays her registration amount, the university blocks her seat and disables anyone else to occupy it. And in such a scenario, they will not be able to enroll someone else for that seat. I hope you understand how the policy works?
122 - 02 Feb 2024 01:20PM - +263 77 749 1315: Duly noted. Thank you for the clarification

153 - 02 Feb 2024 05:51PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
154 - 02 Feb 2024 05:51PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to respond to your message last night as our team is currently working tirelessly towards the preparation of our upcoming Zimbabwe trip in the month of February. Before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to ask how are you doing today?
148 - 02 Feb 2024 04:47PM - +263 71 596 3939: I am fine mam , how about you
149 - 02 Feb 2024 04:52PM - +263 71 596 3939: <Media omitted>
150 - 02 Feb 2024 05:17PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that Ashley. I am fine too, thank you for asking. Mr. Rithvik is the HOD of the DSW department of Edoofa. Our team is currently preparing for the upcoming Zimbabwe trip in the month of February, and he has reached out to you to share some details regarding the same.
151 - 02 Feb 2024 05:19PM - +263 71 596 3939: Okay okay mam for letting me know..
152 - 02 Feb 2024 05:51PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome Ashley. During our previous conversation, you had confirmed your course and year of intake.
153 - 02 Feb 2024 05:51PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
154 - 02 Feb 2024 05:51PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
155 - 02 Feb 2024 05:51PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
156 - 02 Feb 2024 05:57PM - +263 71 596 3939: Yaah sure mam

157 - 02 Feb 2024 07:51PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
158 - 02 Feb 2024 07:51PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.  2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
159 - 02 Feb 2024 07:51PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.  4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
160 - 02 Feb 2024 07:51PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.  6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
161 - 02 Feb 2024 07:51PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.  8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.",No,No

Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of tomorrow.
79 - 02 Feb 2024 02:15PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
80 - 02 Feb 2024 02:15PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.  The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students‚Äô skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to¬†be¬†considered.

So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow before our session.
84 - 02 Feb 2024 04:04PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

Moving forward, it is going to become a part of your essential finances as it is not a one-time expense. The dialysis treatment is surely the most important expense for you currently, however, I am sure that you agree that planning for Derylin's higher education in this situation is also important, right?  Thinking from a long-term perspective, if you are able to plan and adjust your finances accordingly this early on, it will be very beneficial for you when it is time for Derylin to take admission into college. Once she is able to complete her higher education and gets employed, she will also be able to contribute to your expenses and help you and your family live a better life. I am sure you agree with my perspective ma'am?

164 - 02 Feb 2024 03:11PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am fine too, thank you for asking. Let us continue with our previous conversation about the Financial Secure Plan.
165 - 02 Feb 2024 03:11PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child‚Äôs Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
166 - 02 Feb 2024 03:11PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
167 - 02 Feb 2024 03:11PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee.  From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
168 - 02 Feb 2024 03:11PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?

378 - 02 Feb 2024 10:30AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
379 - 02 Feb 2024 10:30AM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
380 - 02 Feb 2024 10:30AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
381 - 02 Feb 2024 11:01AM - +263 78 010 5235: Okay well noted thank you
382 - 02 Feb 2024 01:03PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
383 - 02 Feb 2024 01:03PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
384 - 02 Feb 2024 01:03PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
385 - 02 Feb 2024 02:28PM - +263 78 010 5235: Okay thank you
386 - 02 Feb 2024 03:20PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.

59 - 02 Feb 2024 04:56PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
60 - 02 Feb 2024 04:56PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
61 - 02 Feb 2024 05:21PM - +263 78 082 7631: In the counselling sessions I've never been told about a financial secure plan
62 - 02 Feb 2024 05:21PM - +263 78 082 7631: What plan are you talking about
63 - 02 Feb 2024 05:53PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. The Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an exclusive payment plan we have introduced for the students of 2025 intake. We have carefully curated the plan considering multiple factors like consistency, flexibility and transparency. Allow me to help you understand it better.
64 - 02 Feb 2024 05:53PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
65 - 02 Feb 2024 05:53PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.  2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
66 - 02 Feb 2024 05:53PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.  4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
67 - 02 Feb 2024 05:53PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.  6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.",No,Yes

As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
300 - 01 Feb 2024 05:07PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your ""Earn While You Learn"" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
301 - 01 Feb 2024 05:07PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.

I managed to pay part of the enrolment fee from money that I had served after a long time and the balance I will be able to pay before the deadline as stipulated. The monthly payment of $150 for the next 10 months will be a challenge for me because I and my wife are self employed. We do not have a fixed salary which we can budget fairly well. Our income fluctuates. Sometimes it meets our daily needs sometimes it doesn't.We depend  on clients served at that particular month and work done. So we need your assistance on this situation Madam. I really want to fulfill my daughter's educational aspirations.
200 - 30 Jan 2024 01:51PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kundai. I hope everything is well on your end. Thank you for sharing your concern with me. I understand that your monthly income is dependant on your clients. In such a case, you have the flexibility of deciding the date and amount you are willing to pay in the next 10 months. Our end goal is to ensure that by the end of the first 10 months, you are able to save $1500 for Kundai's education. However, since it is essential to maintain a track of all the payments to ensure timely and smooth progress, we will require you to let us know the amount you will be able to pay each month. Hence, you may suggest a payment plan with flexible amounts that you can pay every month, which will ultimately sum up to $1500 by the end of the 10 months. I hope you are following?

118 - 02 Feb 2024 04:57PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
119 - 02 Feb 2024 04:57PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
120 - 02 Feb 2024 05:55PM - +263 78 725 5242: Absolutely, you're right.
121 - 02 Feb 2024 07:44PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to hear. Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. I would like to explain how this has been achieved during our next session.
122 - 02 Feb 2024 07:45PM - Sidhi Edoofa: On this note, let us conclude our conversation for today and we will reconnect tomorrow for our next session.  I wish you a blessed night!

Kindly excuse me for not being able to respond to your last message as our team is currently tirelessly working towards the preparation of our upcoming Zimbabwe trip this February. Before we proceed with our session, I would like to check in on you and your family. How are you all doing today?
78 - 02 Feb 2024 02:51PM - +27 81 046 0123: Good afternoon Ms Siddhi
79 - 02 Feb 2024 02:52PM - +27 81 046 0123: All is well with us

81 - 02 Feb 2024 03:47PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am fine too, thank you for asking. We were discussing the details of the Financial Secure Plan during our last interaction. Allow me to proceed with the same.
82 - 02 Feb 2024 03:47PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child‚Äôs Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
83 - 02 Feb 2024 03:47PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
84 - 02 Feb 2024 03:47PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee.  From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
85 - 02 Feb 2024 03:47PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?

When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.

133 - 01 Feb 2024 06:18PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
134 - 01 Feb 2024 06:18PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
135 - 01 Feb 2024 06:18PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?

Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
138 - 02 Feb 2024 10:47AM - +263 78 838 3513: How Ms. Siddhi
139 - 02 Feb 2024 12:21PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you paid in the month of January.
140 - 02 Feb 2024 12:21PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months.  That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
141 - 02 Feb 2024 12:21PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
141 - 02 Feb 2024 12:21PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
142 - 02 Feb 2024 07:28PM - +263 78 838 3513: Very correct
143 - 02 Feb 2024 07:32PM - +263 78 838 3513: Sorry Ms. Siddhi, may you please explain this message i have a slight confusion
144 - 02 Feb 2024 08:27PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I surely will Senior. Since my operational hours have concluded and I have had a long day already, let us conclude our conversation for today. We will reconnect tomorrow and I will help you out with your query and we will further discuss the Financial Secure Plan as well.  I wish you a blessed night!",No,No

Kindly excuse me for not being able to respond to your last message as our team is currently tirelessly working towards the preparation of our upcoming Zimbabwe trip this February. Before we proceed with our session, I would like to check in on you and your family. How are you all doing today?

70 - 02 Feb 2024 05:42PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In our previous discussion we were going to begin the 1st step of the admission cycle. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life.  They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
71 - 02 Feb 2024 05:42PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?  For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.  If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?

170 - 02 Feb 2024 02:25PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child‚Äôs Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
171 - 02 Feb 2024 02:26PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
172 - 02 Feb 2024 02:26PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee.  From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.

In a situation where the student is unable to come to India due to personal reasons the amount is non-refundable as the amount is dedicated towards the student's higher education. I am sure that as a parent you must also think about the long-term plan, and would want to ensure that under no unforeseen circumstances you will be projected to financial constraints because you will already be saving up for Simbarashe's higher education.

Surely, if you have access to better healthcare, you would not want to let go of that opportunity.  Having said that, I understand where you are coming from, allow me to help you with your query. In a situation where the student is unable to come to India due to personal reasons the amount is non-refundable as the amount is dedicated towards the student's higher education. I am sure that as a parent you must also think about the long-term plan, and would want to ensure that under no unforeseen circumstances you will be projected to financial constraints because you will already be saving up for Simbarashe's higher education. I hope we are together in this?

If I may ask, have you been able to conduct research about these universities and apply to any of the them yet? <This message was edited>

Since Tawananyasha is such a bright student with straight As in her report cards, I am sure that you must be thoroughly researching about the universities before applying for them. Through her hard work and dedication, she has built an academic profile that makes her stand out in the crowd and she deserves to enroll into a good university for her higher education. May I know if you have been able to shortlist any universities, and if so, could you kindly share the same with me?

Since Tawananyasha will undergo the 1 year pre-med course, that will mean that she will be studying for the next 6 years. If we include the internship period in order to get her license for practising, it will be a total of 7 years. Since Tawananyasha has such a strong motivation towards pursuing medicine, I am sure she will be willing to go ahead with the same, am I correct?

After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realised that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.  In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
303 - 01 Feb 2024 05:04PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?

305 - 02 Feb 2024 04:58PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Trinity.  I hope you are having a wonderful day. Kindly excuse me for not being able to respond to your message last night as our team is currently working tirelessly towards the preparation of our upcoming Zimbabwe trip in the month of February. Before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to ask how are you doing today?
306 - 02 Feb 2024 05:04PM - +263 78 289 4239: We are fine
307 - 02 Feb 2024 05:32PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Allow me to proceed with our previous discussion where I was about to tell you about an exciting plan we have for you!
308 - 02 Feb 2024 05:33PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.  Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
309 - 02 Feb 2024 05:33PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for February 29, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by March 29 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
310 - 02 Feb 2024 05:39PM - +263 77 623 5022: No
311 - 02 Feb 2024 06:19PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, dear. With this, we can proceed to step 4 of the admission cycle, i.e., Offer Letter from University/College. The universities will take three to five days to evaluate your application, after which, if they accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you a scholarship offer letter. In the offer letter, the scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee will be mentioned.  On this note, let us conclude our conversation for today. I had a very good time interacting with you, Trinity. I will reach out to you once we get an update from the universities. Wish you a blessed day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family as well.

309 - 02 Feb 2024 05:33PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for February 29, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by March 29 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?

311 - 02 Feb 2024 06:19PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, dear. With this, we can proceed to step 4 of the admission cycle, i.e., Offer Letter from University/College. The universities will take three to five days to evaluate your application, after which, if they accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you a scholarship offer letter. In the offer letter, the scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee will be mentioned.  On this note, let us conclude our conversation for today. I had a very good time interacting with you, Trinity. I will reach out to you once we get an update from the universities. Wish you a blessed day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family as well.

131 - 02 Feb 2024 01:32PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Wilma.  I hope you are having a lovely day. Certainly. Also, regarding the discussion we had the other day about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
132 - 02 Feb 2024 01:37PM - +263 77 451 2698: No queries
133 - 02 Feb 2024 01:56PM - +263 77 451 2698: We just need to know whether this Plan is compulsory
134 - 02 Feb 2024 02:30PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is not compulsory for every student. However, the benefits of the plan like the $150 waiver and the flexible payment plan will give you an edge towards successfully planning for Wilma's higher education.  For 2024 intake, once the students receive their offer letter, they are required to pay within 15 days of receiving the offer letter as per the university policy. With the Financial Secure Plan, you have the flexibility of accumulating the same amount within a span of the next months. Don't you agree that it is a great way to ensure that you do not have any last minute financial burden?
135 - 02 Feb 2024 02:31PM - +263 77 451 2698: Certainly it is
136 - 02 Feb 2024 03:20PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have the same perspective as well. For the current round of students, there are only 27 seats available for the students who can benefit from the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan.  Since you have been one of the most dedicated students, and I see you have great aspirations, I wanted you to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.
137 - 02 Feb 2024 03:20PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of February, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
138 - 02 Feb 2024 03:20PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
98 - 02 Feb 2024 06:48PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences.

Could you please share: 1)  What inspired you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program? 2) What are your insights and understandings of the program as per your discussions with Proud?

15 - 02 Feb 2024 09:12AM - +263 78 676 2500: My insights and understanding of the program is that it has so many benefits and flexible program  whereby one can earn while learning
113 - 02 Feb 2024 11:51AM - Arshita: *Step 5* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
114 - 02 Feb 2024 11:51AM - Arshita: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn‚Äôt an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year‚Äôs Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
115 - 02 Feb 2024 11:51AM - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
116 - 02 Feb 2024 11:51AM - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.

162 - 02 Feb 2024 03:28PM - Garima Edoofa: Okay well Bryun, since you have understood all the reasons properly as well, can you now tell me:-  1)How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career?  2)How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
163 - 02 Feb 2024 03:45PM - +263 71 544 5511: 1) well since I'm learning in a country with both theory and practical experience i think i would have a better understanding in india and exploring new people and new culture
164 - 02 Feb 2024 03:47PM - +263 71 544 5511: 2) Studying in India would be a great way to broaden my horizons and gain new perspectives on the world. India is a diverse and dynamic country with a rich culture and history, and I think it would be fascinating to experience this firsthand. I would also be able to learn from some of the best minds in the world, as India is home to many prestigious universities.

I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students are capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

181 - 02 Feb 2024 05:36PM - Garima Edoofa: In simple words Bryun what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3700 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food, and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

155 - 02 Feb 2024 10:33AM - Garima Edoofa: @263736909028 as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn‚Äôt given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
156 - 02 Feb 2024 10:36AM - +263 73 690 9028: 1500 to at least 2100
163 - 02 Feb 2024 10:48AM - Garima Edoofa: @263736909028 basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation  If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.  *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).  *Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.  *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
164 - 02 Feb 2024 10:48AM - Garima Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
165 - 02 Feb 2024 10:49AM - +263 73 690 9028: i understand
166 - 02 Feb 2024 10:52AM - Garima Edoofa: @263736909028 , as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspect of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his finances all by himself (in 80 to 100 words)?
167 - 02 Feb 2024 11:06AM - +263 73 690 9028: EDOOFA assists in the application process cutting the cost of application  After receiving a Reservation letter the student is given a 7 day window to pay the 350 dollars to cover for application and the EWYL Training programme but due to prevailing economic challenges   the Organization does allow one to pay 200 in the first 7 days then the remaining 150 in the next 30 days   through the EWYL programme students are given a chance to cover expensive and reduces the expenses for the scholarship
168 - 02 Feb 2024 11:27AM - Garima Edoofa: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you *Enrollment fee* The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days  For all the services and assistance including Applications,SOP,Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions etc all you need to pay is $350   *Cost of education* The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee,Accommodation,Food,Wifi,Laundry,Library,Gym fee etc!  This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
169 - 02 Feb 2024 11:27AM - Garima Edoofa: I hope you are now clear?
170 - 02 Feb 2024 11:28AM - +263 73 690 9028: crystal madam
171 - 02 Feb 2024 11:30AM - Garima Edoofa: Yes @263736909028 and I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
172 - 02 Feb 2024 11:30AM - +263 73 690 9028: 100 percent
178 - 02 Feb 2024 11:34AM - Garima Edoofa: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
179 - 02 Feb 2024 11:34AM - Garima Edoofa: Basically, this registration fee of ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments*. The first part will be paid in Coming few months of (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).  *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Under Edoofa students not only learn the skills but also earn for learning. The earning here is defined in terms of recommendations, scholarship credits, industrial exposure, an experience that prepares them for life after college and skills to excel during that period.  With Earn While You Learn a student starts earning on the first day and by the time they finish the degree, they would not only gain theoretical but also practical knowledge. Edoofa holds a belief that higher education should not only be affordable but also be outcome-driven, opening doors for more professional  opportunities.  The Earn While You Learn also enables students to generate income through wages from I dustrial attachments and part time jobs. This provides students with finances to meet part of their school fees and other demands attached to the training. 7.Yes

14 - 02 Feb 2024 12:56PM - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
15 - 02 Feb 2024 12:56PM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
16 - 02 Feb 2024 12:56PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
18 - 02 Feb 2024 12:56PM - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
19 - 02 Feb 2024 12:56PM - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
20 - 02 Feb 2024 12:56PM - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
21 - 02 Feb 2024 12:56PM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
22 - 02 Feb 2024 12:57PM - +260 97 2880666: Yes
23 - 02 Feb 2024 01:22PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Likezo, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
24 - 02 Feb 2024 01:29PM - +260 97 2880666: I know I am capable of doing so  sir
25 - 02 Feb 2024 01:34PM - Gurvinder: Now Likezo, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-  1. Your highest education level? 2. The course you would like to study? 3. What do your parents do? 4. What is your parent‚Äôs highest education level? 5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far? 6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad? 7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do? 8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in Grade 12?  Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!

15 - 02 Feb 2024 01:21PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
16 - 02 Feb 2024 01:21PM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert‚Äôs, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
17 - 02 Feb 2024 01:21PM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
19 - 02 Feb 2024 01:28PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Nyasha, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
20 - 02 Feb 2024 01:31PM - +263 77 553 3669: Yes but to some point my Guardian who is my uncle is always busy
21 - 02 Feb 2024 01:44PM - Gurvinder: Noted.
22 - 02 Feb 2024 01:45PM - Gurvinder: Now Nyasha, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-  1. Your highest education level? 2. The course you would like to study? 3. What do your parents do? 4. What is your parent‚Äôs highest education level? 5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far? 6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad? 7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do? 8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?  Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
23 - 02 Feb 2024 07:33PM - +263 77 553 3669: My name is Nyasha Masiyiwa a male applicant born in 2002 My highest education attainment is advanced level I did my A level at Manunure High School in Kwekwe got 8 point in commercials (Economics, Business Studies and Computer science I've always had passion with technology changes so would love to venture into software engineering or development or a degree in economics Both of my parents passed and I live with my Uncle who is a Tailor and owns a small enterprise My uncle ended his education at Advanced level due to lack of funds if I was to get education abroad my uncle is the one who will support me financially I have a little sister named Nyaradzo she is still @ Primary level Currently I'm not going to school I'm done with my Advanced level which I wrote last year at Manunure High School in Midlands and the fee was us$45 per term

172 - 02 Feb 2024 11:08AM - Gurvinder: Pauseland as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn‚Äôt given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
173 - 02 Feb 2024 11:11AM - +263 78 588 0702: Okay that will be 1500 to 2250
174 - 02 Feb 2024 11:32AM - Gurvinder: Exactly Pauseland, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.

182 - 02 Feb 2024 01:25PM - Gurvinder: Pauseland basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation  If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.  *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).  *Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.  *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
183 - 02 Feb 2024 01:25PM - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.  I hope to get a positive response from you soon.

314 - 02 Feb 2024 08:51AM - Gurvinder: You can surely pay the fee in US Dollar please.
315 - 02 Feb 2024 09:21AM - +971 55 245 0259: Give account..
316 - 02 Feb 2024 09:22AM - Gurvinder: The Bank Details that are to be used are the same @971552450259:  Swift code: AXISINBB207 IFSC code: UTIB0001147 Bank Name: Axis Bank Ltd. Account Name: Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. Current Account Number: 917020070183626 Bank's Name:  Axis Bank Ltd. Bank‚Äôs Address: Janakpuri, B Block, New Delhi[DL] Ground Floor & Basement, B-1/503, Janakpuri, New Delhi 110058
317 - 02 Feb 2024 09:22AM - Gurvinder: You can complete the fee through online mode as well, if you wish shall I share that with you?
325 - 02 Feb 2024 01:28PM - +971 55 245 0259: Yes
326 - 02 Feb 2024 01:28PM - +971 55 245 0259: Yes we can arrange that as quick as possible
327 - 02 Feb 2024 01:30PM - Gurvinder: Basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.  So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
328 - 02 Feb 2024 01:30PM - Gurvinder: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-  BANK NAME: FBC  SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA  ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA  ACC NUMBER: 5333038014048828  CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854

401 - 02 Feb 2024 01:45PM - +260 97 7418333: I would lile to make a transfer from my standchart account
402 - 02 Feb 2024 01:51PM - Gurvinder: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $35 to $50 which is quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zambia itself. Due to this not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $35 to $50 just as transfer charge.  The second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in our associate Mr. Hammond and Mrs. Penelope's organization Penmal Connect's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 10% at the end.  So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Penmal Connect's account as you see he is our Associate in Zambia, His contribution has been immense because of which students like Muchimba are able to pursue their education in India.
403 - 02 Feb 2024 01:51PM - Gurvinder: The fee payment can also be made through them. Since they have two accounts one is a USD account and the other is the Zambian Kwacha Account, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $385 ($350 + $35 transfer charges) or equivalent Zambian Kwacha, and the same details are as below:-  US Dollar Account Bank Name: FNB Branch: Acacia Branch Account Name: Penmal Connect Ltd Account Number: 62878003806 Swift Code: FIRNZMLX Sort Code: 2600001 Contact Number: +260972651616, +260978789429 Address: 8 Chibote Avenue, Parklands, Kitwe, Copperbelt Province, Zambia  Zambian Kwacha Account  Bank Name: Indo Zambia Bank Branch: Jacaranda Account Name: Penmal Connect Limited Account Number: 0222030000591 Swift Code: INZAZMLX Sort Code: 090122",No,No

84 - 02 Feb 2024 01:52PM - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
85 - 02 Feb 2024 01:52PM - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:  *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*

55 - 02 Feb 2024 01:46PM - Harmehak: You see, Tafataona, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.  Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.",No,No

156 - 02 Feb 2024 11:21AM - Harmehak: Let me help you have a clarity regarding the same.
157 - 02 Feb 2024 11:22AM - Harmehak: Now you see Takudzwa, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid in semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.  So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $1800, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $900 in the first semester and $900 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.  Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!

119 - 02 Feb 2024 11:30AM - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_

125 - 02 Feb 2024 10:38AM - Harmehak: In simple words Tawonga, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*  However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.

There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-  1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.  2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.

148 - 02 Feb 2024 04:12PM - Kunal: Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about Antonio achieving it.

131 - 02 Feb 2024 03:51PM - Kunal: I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.  May I know how you feel about your child studying abroad? <This message was edited>
132 - 02 Feb 2024 03:54PM - +263 77 840 8700: Its a good thing since we trust in the high quality education in countries like India, also a good scholarship can increase chances of getting employment
133 - 02 Feb 2024 04:11PM - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, studying Internationally would make your child‚Äôs career advance at an even greater pace, as your child will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would help in uplifting your family and provide a hassle-free life.
134 - 02 Feb 2024 04:11PM - Kunal: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone*  *1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.  *2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.  *3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university. Do you know about other requirements?
135 - 02 Feb 2024 04:27PM - +263 77 840 8700: I think academic certificates
136 - 02 Feb 2024 04:36PM - Kunal: Absolutely, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child‚Äôs eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*  *Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.

I am reaching out to you as a parent on behalf of my son, Chimwemwe Ngaiyaye Majanga, who has been found eligible to pursue a science in agriculture through your esteemed scholarship program. We are immensely grateful for this opportunity, and we are eager to see him thrive in this academic pursuit.  Regrettably, I must bring to your attention the financial challenges we are currently facing, which are making it exceedingly difficult for us to raise the required funds for the enrollment fee within the specified timeframe. Due to poverty and financial constraints, we find ourselves in a position where meeting this financial obligation has become an insurmountable hurdle.  Understanding the significance of meeting enrollment requirements, I humbly appeal to you to consider extending the closing date for the enrollment fee. This extension would afford us the necessary time to secure the requisite funds and enable Chimwemwe to take full advantage of the life-changing opportunity your scholarship program provides.  As parents, we are deeply committed to providing our son with the best possible education and opportunities for a bright and prosperous future. The Edoofa Scholarship Program is an invaluable beacon of hope for Chimwemwe and many other deserving students who aspire to overcome financial hardships and pursue their educational dreams.  I sincerely hope that you will give thoughtful consideration to our earnest request for an extension of the enrollment fee deadline. Your understanding and flexibility in this matter will not only benefit Chimwemwe but also numerous other students who are in similar circumstances and share the same aspirations for a better future.  We are immensely grateful for the opportunity that the Edoofa Scholarship Program presents, and we remain hopeful that our request will be positively received. Your support and understanding in this matter will make a profound difference in the lives of aspiring students like Chimwemwe.  Thank you for your attention to this matter. We eagerly anticipate a positive response and hope for the opportunity for Chimwemwe to participate in your scholarship program.  Warm regards,  Mrs Ngaiyaye

148 - 02 Feb 2024 06:13PM - Kunal: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.  This registration fee($500-$1000) isn‚Äôt an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year‚Äôs Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
149 - 02 Feb 2024 06:13PM - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.  I hope you are clear with the process.

237 - 02 Feb 2024 05:46AM - Kunal: Good morning, Lorraine
238 - 02 Feb 2024 05:46AM - Kunal: Well, We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.  In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.  In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.  Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!  Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.  We are left with 5 and 6. So shall I explain it to you?
239 - 02 Feb 2024 10:26AM - +263 71 894 0545: Yes you can
240 - 02 Feb 2024 11:39AM - Kunal: *Step 5:* After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.  August 2025 intake applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.  This registration fee($500-$1000) isn‚Äôt an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year‚Äôs Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
241 - 02 Feb 2024 11:39AM - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.  I hope you are clear with the process.
242 - 02 Feb 2024 05:09PM - Kunal: We have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-  *About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.* *Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.* *The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
243 - 02 Feb 2024 05:09PM - Kunal: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,  *Edoofa‚Äôs Website- www.edoofa.com* *Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*  *Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.  Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

August 2025 intake applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.  This registration fee($500-$1000) isn‚Äôt an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year‚Äôs Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

I hope you are clear with the process.

39 - 02 Feb 2024 10:42AM - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
40 - 02 Feb 2024 10:42AM - Pallika Edoofa: Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
41 - 02 Feb 2024 11:14AM - +263 77 776 9198: I am aiming higher for my Advanced level exams.

97 - 02 Feb 2024 02:52PM - Pallika Edoofa: Continuing the discussion, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.  In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.  With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process. This reduced cost includes: *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*

1 hr 32 mins","101 - 02 Feb 2024 10:13AM - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely, If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*  *You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.

103 - 02 Feb 2024 10:22AM - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed, it is!
104 - 02 Feb 2024 10:22AM - Pallika Edoofa: Now, As we are proceeding towards the end of the session, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :  *1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.  *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.  *3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world.  *4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*  After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?

151 - 02 Feb 2024 12:57PM - Pallika Edoofa: Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.

156 - 02 Feb 2024 02:46PM - Pallika Edoofa: Tadiwanashe, we have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-  *About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.* *Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.* *The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*

This ensures that they can follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions they may have. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.  *So, I am making you the group admin. I see one of your parents is already a part of the group. Please add other parent/guardians or educational supporters and let me know the names and the relations once done.

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ‚Äã: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.  2. *Employability through practical training* ‚Äã: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
201 - 02 Feb 2024 09:31AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What‚Äôs more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.  4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
202 - 02 Feb 2024 09:31AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
203 - 02 Feb 2024 09:36AM - +263 78 219 1395: Well l liked the most 3rd and 4th points sir.
204 - 02 Feb 2024 09:40AM - +263 78 219 1395: All of them they are exceptionally good. I'm beginning to think the second point is par excellent in the sense that it will offer me a diverse and robust skills which if synchronized with the program l will be undertaking it will be awesome
205 - 02 Feb 2024 09:57AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Petnet! The role of practical training in an educational journey is of paramount importance. It serves as the bridge between theoretical knowledge and real-world application, equipping students with the essential skills and experiences needed to thrive in their chosen fields. Practical training cultivates problem-solving abilities, critical thinking, and hands-on expertise that textbooks and lectures alone cannot provide. It offers a deeper understanding of the subject matter, promotes self-confidence, and prepares individuals for the challenges they will encounter in their professional careers!
206 - 02 Feb 2024 09:57AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
207 - 02 Feb 2024 10:05AM - +263 78 219 1395: They don't have any problem sir as far as l know and they are willing to support me.  Though they are skeptical sometimes due to the sky rocketing cases of human trafficking. I'm sure they would love assurance that with Edoofa l will be in safe hands.
208 - 02 Feb 2024 10:06AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can conclude that you are diligent and possess extreme valor. You will surely prove your mettle if provided with the right path. Moreover, Edoofa is a big family, and I can assure you that you will never feel like an outcast or out of place! Furthermore, Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents!
209 - 02 Feb 2024 10:07AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Moreover, As *Edoofa* we also prioritize a student's security! That is the reason we are the most trusted organization in Africa with a community of more than 4000 students! Furthermore, after the session, I will connect you with a few of the students who are currently studying in India with us, so that you and your parents can connect with them!

210 - 02 Feb 2024 10:10AM - +263 78 219 1395: OK that will be perfect sir. Probably it will eliminate fears in them as well.
211 - 02 Feb 2024 10:34AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be  1) *Application Form*  2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.  3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
212 - 02 Feb 2024 10:36AM - +263 78 219 1395: So on the letter of recommendation it's senior authorities from my previous school  or from attachment
213 - 02 Feb 2024 10:41AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Petnet. We here at Edoofa have a dedicated team that will help you with your *Statement of Purpose* as well as the *Letter of Recommendation*!
214 - 02 Feb 2024 10:41AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student‚Äôs application or they would straightaway reject it.  Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not* And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
215 - 02 Feb 2024 10:41AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
215 - 02 Feb 2024 10:41AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750.

217 - 02 Feb 2024 10:41AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your  - *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team* - *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities* - *Earn While You Learn Program and training* - *University sessions and interactions* - *A guaranteed scholarship seat* - *Visa Documentation Assistance* - *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
218 - 02 Feb 2024 11:10AM - +263 78 219 1395: OK so l got this right next step from here is to be found eligible for the Edoofa scholarship 2nd step l receive an acceptance letter 3rd step l pay $350 for enrollment. Ist and 2nd step Edoofa will be doing it for me is it?
219 - 02 Feb 2024 11:11AM - +263 78 219 1395: How long is the process between application for admission and receiving the acceptance letter
220 - 02 Feb 2024 11:59AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
