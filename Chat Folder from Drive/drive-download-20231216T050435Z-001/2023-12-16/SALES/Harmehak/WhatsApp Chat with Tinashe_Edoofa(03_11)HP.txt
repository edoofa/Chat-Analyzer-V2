This what makes me interested to apply for the scholarship
22/11/23, 2:23 pm - Harmehak: Well received, Tinashe, so, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
22/11/23, 2:23 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others.

24/11/23, 9:23 am - Harmehak: Did you go through the shared document, Tinashe?
24/11/23, 9:24 am - +263 77 119 0510: Still downloading network was the challenge yesterday

24/11/23, 1:21 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Now l am done with the document
24/11/23, 1:26 pm - Harmehak: Well now that you have gone through the document could you please share with me-

1. Your understanding of the Edoofa program?
2. Your understanding of the financial aspect of the program?
24/11/23, 5:03 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Edoofa is therefore to provide afodability for higher and quality education to deserving students, in various prestigious universities in India, apart from afodability, Edoofa is also therefore to provide employability to the Edoofa learning students. It provides internship to the learning students, thereby giving students opportunities of earning while learning, this as result helps students to the chances of credibility and it is a chance of reducing their fees loans. By doing so, it creates a strong hard working   and well experience with high quality level of knowledge.
24/11/23, 7:58 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting to hear from you earlier, so now I would be scheduling your session for *Monday at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over and it's already been a long day, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
25/11/23, 9:39 am - +263 77 119 0510: In terms of financial aspects, it is a well designed program, which is helpful for deserving students, for it provides a room to allow students to have loans and at the same time providing internships to students as a way of depreciating their debt balance. Bt it is a bit complex to those who are less previladge or those who didn't manage to get a sponsor for the scholarships process execution. And to those who didn't manage to get a 100% scholarship. I understand it is also good to the organisation, for it is also a sicial profit organization. Yaar that's my understanding
27/11/23, 11:11 am - +263 77 119 0510: Ok
27/11/23, 12:31 pm - Harmehak: Hello Everyone,

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
27/11/23, 8:43 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 12 PM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
27/11/23, 9:01 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Apologies for time miss out
28/11/23, 11:59 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
28/11/23, 12:43 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Apologies for late response
28/11/23, 12:43 pm - +263 77 119 0510: We can
28/11/23, 1:10 pm - Harmehak: Alright please,

So did you understand the following too?
28/11/23, 1:11 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
28/11/23, 3:23 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Ok l understand
28/11/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 119 0510: So l must supposed to take care of0$3000 for myself that's what you mean
28/11/23, 3:53 pm - Harmehak: What did you understand from the same please?
28/11/23, 5:48 pm - +263 77 119 0510: My understanding is, the scholarship will take of 62.5% of the university expenses per year and the student will  care of the remaining 37.5% of the expenses. And if l approved to be doing well in  evaluation, there gonna be a further reduction in of the fee or get an opportunity of earning while learning so that l can be able to take care of the remaining fee balance, that is my understanding from above script.
28/11/23, 6:07 pm - Harmehak: Well put across, Tinashe.
28/11/23, 6:07 pm - Harmehak: So did you discuss the same with your parents too?

02/12/23, 11:24 am - Harmehak: What all did you discuss with them, Tinashe?
02/12/23, 11:31 am - +263 77 119 0510: I told them all about how the scholarship works on funding students, l told them abt the internships program which the scholarship give to the deserving students, I told them abt the reason why this scholar program is mainly centralized in India than in other countries, I told them abt hw Edoofa helps students to get visas.
02/12/23, 11:32 am - Harmehak: That's wonderful,

I am glad you had an elaborated discussion.

So far are there any queries for me?
02/12/23, 11:32 am - +263 77 119 0510: And l told them also abt hw the scholar will take care of varsity expenses
02/12/23, 11:37 am - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate?
02/12/23, 11:38 am - +263 77 119 0510: Yaar their concern and my concern abt, the flight number  one, 2, what if l didn't get an approval of getting an opportunity of getting an internship or a part time job, so that I can earn while I Learn, since l am from a less previladges financial background, does it work well for me?. I need yr yr advice from this question.
02/12/23, 11:40 am - Harmehak: Can you please properly rephrase your question without using any abbreviations, Tinashe?
02/12/23, 11:49 am - +263 77 119 0510: I told the that the approximate value per year for university expenses is about $8000, and there is a chance that the scholarship can help the student to reduce this amount to $3000,meaning that the scholarship have reduced the burden of the university expenses by 67.5% and the student will take care of the remaining 37, 5%. And then if a student gets an opportunity to get an internship or a part-time job, it will be easy for a student to take care of this 37.5% because he or she will be earning while learning, he/she will be able to pay little by little until he/she finished studies
02/12/23, 11:50 am - +263 77 119 0510: Ok
02/12/23, 11:55 am - Harmehak: Very correct Tinashe
02/12/23, 11:56 am - Harmehak: So, are your parents willing to support you with $1500 a year?
02/12/23, 12:14 pm - +263 77 119 0510: What l am saying is, my parents was asking about how did the scholarship take care of flights in case the student is approved to study with Edoofa program, that is the first issue, secondly what if a student got an opportunity to study with Edoofa scholarship, and he/she did not get an approval of having an internship or part time job for earning while learning, since someone like me is from a less previladged financial background, doe it work well with me to cover the remaining costs like this 37.5% of the remaining university expenses or there are other options of payment plans
02/12/23, 12:16 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Yes
02/12/23, 12:20 pm - +263 77 119 0510: How this can be payed, the whole figure once a year or in artitions per semester?
02/12/23, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: Alright so Tinashe, firstly may I know if you are clear that Edoofa offers scholarship on tuition fee itself?
02/12/23, 12:38 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Not so clear
02/12/23, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: Did you thoroughly read the document?
02/12/23, 12:41 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Yes l did bt l didn't clearly understand it
02/12/23, 12:42 pm - +263 77 119 0510: In terms of tuition fees and university expenses
02/12/23, 12:43 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
02/12/23, 12:45 pm - Harmehak: Now are you clear that Edoofa offers scholarship on tuition fee itself, Tinashe?
02/12/23, 12:45 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Yes its now clear
02/12/23, 12:45 pm - Harmehak: Now do you have any queries?
02/12/23, 12:46 pm - +263 77 119 0510: No
02/12/23, 12:46 pm - Harmehak: Have you thoroughly followed everything we have discussed so far?
02/12/23, 12:53 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Not yet so far
02/12/23, 12:55 pm - Harmehak: My question was if you have followed everything?
02/12/23, 12:55 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Yes l did
02/12/23, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: That's great
02/12/23, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: Did you ask them if they are willing to support you financially, Tinashe?
02/12/23, 1:47 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Yes l did, and they were willing
02/12/23, 7:18 pm - Harmehak: That's great, Tinashe.

08/12/23, 10:07 am - +263 77 119 0510: People building various types of industries, businesses and Factories. All of these institutions require energy for the operation of machines, the  world also advancing into etronised systems, so all those gadgets and machines that being made, they need energy from electricity, so it inspires me a lot
08/12/23, 10:14 am - Harmehak: That's great,

So now let me brief you about your desired course.
08/12/23, 10:14 am - +263 77 119 0510: Ok Ms harmehak go ahead

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1IDdUSWf-Q&t=590s
12/12/23, 9:22 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Apologies for not communicating, it was as a result of whatsapp bundles running out
13/12/23, 9:10 am - Harmehak: Good morning Tinashe
14/12/23, 10:53 am - +263 77 119 0510: Good morning Ms harmehak
14/12/23, 10:57 am - Harmehak: How are you doing today, Tinashe?
14/12/23, 11:01 am - +263 77 119 0510: Am doing good
14/12/23, 11:01 am - +263 77 119 0510: And you Ms
14/12/23, 11:06 am - Harmehak: I am doing well please
14/12/23, 11:07 am - +263 77 119 0510: We thank God survival
14/12/23, 11:11 am - +263 77 119 0510: Apologies for communication breakdown, it saw due to insufficient what'sapp bundles
14/12/23, 11:12 am - +263 77 119 0510: I am now ready to go on with the discussion
14/12/23, 11:19 am - Harmehak: How do you plan on completing the Counseling session in such scenarios, Tinashe?
14/12/23, 11:22 am - +263 77 119 0510: I think as from now l will try by all means not to encounter such problems until l finished counseling
14/12/23, 11:24 am - Harmehak: I understand
14/12/23, 11:24 am - Harmehak: Did you go through the same?
14/12/23, 11:27 am - +263 77 119 0510: Yes l did
14/12/23, 11:28 am - Harmehak: Alright Tinashe, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
14/12/23, 11:33 am - +263 77 119 0510: Definitely if l got this career option and at the same time got enrolled in Edoofa program, in 5 years time l will see my self totally transformed from a grass root level to the lvl of grace, l imagine myself as a great nation in my lyf
14/12/23, 11:33 am - Harmehak: That is really great Tinashe, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
14/12/23, 11:48 am - +263 77 119 0510: One of the major reasons is that, l don't have financial stability, to take care of fees, so by the reason being that Edoofa is helping students to study abroad, is one of the major cause that attracted me to like to study abroad. Reason number 2 is that of employability programs that is being made by Edoofa, rather than in our nation you have to seek for yourself a job, or to create a job for yr self, it is good bt it take time. I don't hate to study in my country Because all l need is knowledge and wisdom to be an effective and innovative huma being in the community or world, bt financial instability and economic crisis in our country is the greatest limitation
14/12/23, 11:51 am - Harmehak: You see, Tinashe, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
14/12/23, 11:53 am - +263 77 119 0510: Very true
14/12/23, 11:54 am - Harmehak: Indeed, however I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future, Tinashe.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
14/12/23, 12:01 pm - +263 77 119 0510: I don't hv much detail abt lndia, bt India have a lot of specialist around the world in every faculty ministry, so this gives me a clear picture that india is producing quality knowledge and skilled graduates
14/12/23, 12:02 pm - Harmehak: I can see you have basic awareness, Tinashe!
14/12/23, 12:02 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

14/12/23, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: While I understand, you can go through the images later and read the shared information, Tinashe.
14/12/23, 12:23 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Ok thank you
14/12/23, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: Did you thoroughly read the shared information, Tinashe?
14/12/23, 12:37 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Yes l am through now
14/12/23, 12:37 pm - Harmehak: Did you find the information helpful, Tinashe?

14/12/23, 12:37 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Yes
14/12/23, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
14/12/23, 12:46 pm - +263 77 119 0510: By any chance l can go for lndia because Indian degrees are globaly recognized, l liked the issue of cultural diversity in India because in some countries there is racism, and l liked also the fact that india is a home to high rated institutions known for their academic experience and quality education
14/12/23, 12:46 pm - Harmehak: That's great, Tinashe
14/12/23, 12:47 pm - Harmehak: Meanwhile, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
14/12/23, 12:48 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Yaar there is huge difference
14/12/23, 12:49 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
14/12/23, 12:49 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
14/12/23, 12:49 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 12:54 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Well understood Ms harmehak
14/12/23, 12:55 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
14/12/23, 12:56 pm - +263 77 119 0510: It is good fees breakdown
14/12/23, 1:01 pm - Harmehak: Indeed!
14/12/23, 1:02 pm - Harmehak: Tinashe, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
14/12/23, 1:08 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Indeed it's true
14/12/23, 1:08 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Tinashe?
14/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Yes
14/12/23, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
14/12/23, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
14/12/23, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
14/12/23, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

14/12/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Yes it EWYL is good program which is helpful to the students
14/12/23, 2:04 pm - Harmehak: Indeed!
14/12/23, 2:05 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
14/12/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Well explained
14/12/23, 3:55 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

14/12/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 119 0510: T ha that is great
14/12/23, 3:59 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Definitely there is transiperent different
14/12/23, 4:03 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
14/12/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Yes am ready
14/12/23, 4:05 pm - Harmehak: Tinashe, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
14/12/23, 4:06 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
14/12/23, 4:12 pm - +263 77 119 0510: $1500to $2250
14/12/23, 4:14 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
14/12/23, 4:14 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
14/12/23, 4:14 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 4:14 pm - Harmehak: You see, Tinashe, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
14/12/23, 4:17 pm - +263 77 119 0510: I do
14/12/23, 4:17 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
14/12/23, 4:17 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
14/12/23, 4:17 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
14/12/23, 4:22 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Amazing strategy
14/12/23, 4:22 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate, Tinashe
14/12/23, 4:22 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
14/12/23, 4:22 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 4:23 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
14/12/23, 4:23 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
14/12/23, 4:25 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Yes
14/12/23, 4:25 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
14/12/23, 4:25 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
14/12/23, 4:25 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

14/12/23, 4:28 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Ok well outlined
14/12/23, 4:30 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
14/12/23, 4:30 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
14/12/23, 4:31 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 4:32 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Thank you Ms Harmehak
14/12/23, 4:34 pm - Harmehak: Do connect her with your mother as well since they can communicate in Shona.
14/12/23, 4:37 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Ok
14/12/23, 4:37 pm - Harmehak: Yes please,

So Tinashe, do you have any queries for me?
14/12/23, 4:39 pm - +263 77 119 0510: So far no quiries yet, but if quiries get to rise I will ask you Ms Harmehak for clarity
14/12/23, 4:40 pm - Harmehak: Sure please
14/12/23, 4:40 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
14/12/23, 4:40 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
14/12/23, 4:40 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.
