15/12/23, 3:49 pm - Tushti: Well the annual cost of education could be around $2000 after scholarship

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
15/12/23, 7:11 pm - +27 63 535 7978: I had to brainstorm all of this scholarship type of thing you are mentioning here if am wrong correct me. Juliana is looking for a scholarship because we are not affording to pay so there is no way you can demand or request 2000 from us like how when you already giving her the scholarship because we can't afford there is no way please if thus how you work mmmh kkkk. Was busy during the day to respond to all of these things but there is no way you can get money from us it's better we continue with what we were having than to be scammed money over unnecessary things please
