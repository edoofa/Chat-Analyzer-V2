I am 17 years old currently preparing for  upper six in 2024 at Lady Enarater International high school which is located in Mashonaland Central, Zimbabwe.Lady Enarater high school is a reliable International private school which is paid USD 1300 per term. I am doing science subjects which are  maths,chemistry and biology because I believe that I am going to be a successful neurosurgeon in the next few years to come ,why? because i know there are lot of people out there who have debilitating conditions in our country and there are a few neurosurgeon who can help them so I believe I will be at help too if I was to add the number of neurosurgeon in our country and would gladly would be at help if i am to become International too. 
For my strengths ,my leadership skills are quite breathe taking says spectators' feedback because currently am a leader at Lady Enarater International high school, teamwork too,problem solving and communication too can count as I am seeing myself being a therapist and a neurosurgeon too.
As for my weaknesses ,one of them is being a highly sensitive person as I sometimes consider other people 's emotions rather than mine.
i am into music and reading a lot of books during my free time.
As I mentioned above ,I am the first born child in a family of two children, where the last born is a 11 year old boy at primary level right now preparing for his final year at primary level.My father and mother have been financially supporting my education ever since I stepped my way in kindergarten and they will  continue to do so until I'm in my graduation gown,but I also have plans in supporting them too as time goes by.My father is a pharmacy sales representative and my mother is a hair dresser who  Try their best everyday for our wellbeing.

Thank you
15/12/23, 9:27 am - Tushti: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

15/12/23, 11:18 am - Tushti: Thank you for sharing such a detailed and inspiring introduction. It's evident that you have a clear vision for your future and are dedicated to pursuing a career as a neurosurgeon. Your commitment to making a positive impact on the lives of others in Zimbabwe is commendable.
15/12/23, 11:18 am - Tushti: Your strengths, particularly in leadership, teamwork, problem-solving, and communication, are essential attributes for a successful career in medicine. It's great to see that you are already demonstrating these skills in your current role as a leader at Lady Enarater International high school.
15/12/23, 11:18 am - Tushti: Given your family background and the financial support from your parents, it's wonderful that you have plans to support them in return.

15/12/23, 11:36 am - +263 78 749 4463: Thank you
15/12/23, 11:36 am - +263 78 749 4463: Yesss 
I am working on that
15/12/23, 11:49 am - Tushti: Munashe, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
15/12/23, 11:49 am - Tushti: You see majority of the time students study subjects as per their country's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics

2. Bachelor of Science in Microbiology

3. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology

4. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology

5. Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy

6. Bachelor of science in Optometry

7. Bachelor of science in Biochemistry

8. Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology
15/12/23, 11:53 am - +263 78 749 4463: So for my situation mathematics is not necessary??
15/12/23, 11:54 am - +263 78 749 4463: Because unfortunately for my case ,physics is not involved in the picture
15/12/23, 11:55 am - +263 78 749 4463: So is it possible for me to do Medicine without physics
15/12/23, 11:56 am - Tushti: It is not possible, dear
15/12/23, 11:56 am - Tushti: These are the courses that must now choose from
