15/12/23, 12:38 pm - Tushti: Thank you, dear
15/12/23, 12:38 pm - Tushti: Now, you mentioned you have younger siblings in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for your family to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are they facing such a situation?
15/12/23, 12:41 pm - +263 78 480 4427: Yes they are ,and its quite unfortunate that they have to endure the pain just for us to have a better tomorrow
15/12/23, 12:43 pm - Tushti: Well, that's the sacrifice parents willingly make to ensure a brighter future for their kids
15/12/23, 12:43 pm - Tushti: I would like for them to come online and help me understand how the family would manage the finances involved in your higher education abroad?
15/12/23, 12:44 pm - +263 78 480 4427: How much is required
15/12/23, 12:47 pm - +263 78 480 4427: For a start like l need to know how the schoolarship is going to work ,maybe l can be an intern there after school hours
15/12/23, 1:07 pm - Tushti: The annual cost of education without sholarship could be around $7000, with the help of scholarship, it would come down to around $2000 per year
15/12/23, 1:11 pm - +263 78 480 4427: They cannot afford it
15/12/23, 1:16 pm - Tushti: Noted
