01/12/23, 5:27 pm - +263 78 635 0533: Good afternoon Sir
I'm sorry for replying late there was a problem with the network
01/12/23, 5:28 pm - +263 78 635 0533: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 5:32 pm - +263 78 635 0533: I'm sorry to report that I didn't pass , I'm disappointed in myself, but I'm committed to working hard to improve my grades. I understand that this may affect my scholarship, but I'm willing to discuss this further, if needed.
01/12/23, 6:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it!
01/12/23, 6:46 pm - +263 78 635 0533: Yes Sir I'm confident

I will do my best to pass.
01/12/23, 6:52 pm - +263 78 635 0533: I want to assure you that I'm committed to learning from my mistakes and improving my performance in the future.

01/12/23, 6:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly brief me regarding your career aspirations more vividly?
01/12/23, 6:55 pm - +263 78 635 0533: I really appreciate your belief in me
01/12/23, 7:01 pm - +263 78 635 0533: I've always had a passion for engineering, and I'm interested in pursuing a career in this field. 
I've always been fascinated by the way that engineers use science and technology to solve problems.
01/12/23, 7:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since engineering encompasses a wide range of specialties, may I inquire about the specific area that intrigues you?
01/12/23, 8:08 pm - +263 78 635 0533: Civil engineering 

because it is a fascinating field that involves designing and constructing the infrastructure that keeps our world running for example bridges, roads, and buildings
01/12/23, 9:33 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know what drew you towards that peculiar domain, please?

05/12/23, 10:14 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please acknowledge this question?
05/12/23, 10:21 am - +263 78 635 0533: I was drawn to civil engineering because I've always been fascinated by the way that infrastructure shapes our world. I love the idea of being able to create structures that will last for generations and improve people's lives.
05/12/23, 10:42 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Shalom. As your *Career Counselor* it is my duty to guide you towards a path that caters to your aspirations. I have analyzed your endeavors and career inclinations. According to my expertise, this program aligns perfectly with your magnificent vision:

*B.Tech Civil*
​*B.Tech Civil Engineering: What is it About?*

Civil engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines in the world. Civil engineering, until a few decades back, was a much sought after course among Indian students, but lately has been sidelined due to the software and IT boom. However with the increasing need to develop and maintain India’s infrastructure, which is lagging in all aspects, this field is bouncing back strongly.

Do you want me to guide you about the course in depth?
05/12/23, 10:46 am - +263 78 635 0533: Yes, I'd love to learn more about the course.
05/12/23, 11:08 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: B.Tech Civil
​*B.Tech Civil Engineering: What is it About?*

Civil engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines in the world. Civil engineering, until a few decades back, was a much sought after course among Indian students, but lately has been sidelined due to the software and IT boom. However with the increasing need to develop and maintain India’s infrastructure, which is lagging in all aspects, this field is bouncing back strongly.

There are options for higher studies after the completion of B.Tech. course. Students can pursue Master’s degree in specialized course. Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Civil engineering and other allied branches like-

*Structural Engineering*
*Architectural Engineering*
*Geotechnical Engineering*
*Environmental Engineering etc.*

*B.Tech Civil Engineering: Who should opt?*

Before you decide to pursue your undergraduate studies in this field, it is important to understand that Civil engineering is not just about buildings and bridges. If you are under the assumption that all that civil engineers do is wear a yellow helmet and supervise workers in construction sites, then you are yet to understand the true capacity of this field. 


*Career aspects*

In these cases, you will have to hunt for a core engineering job all by yourself through off-campus placements. Creating strong professional networks, developing a great resume with stellar GPA and doing impressive projects and internships will help you secure a job in one of the core civil engineering companies.

Also, civil engineers find work not just in construction industry, but also in other industries such as oil and energy, transportation, petroleum, environmental, power and electric utilities, chemical etc where infrastructure projects and construction facilities are involved. Some students transition to software, consulting or banking as they feel that salary and growth prospects are better in these sectors.

05/12/23, 11:41 am - +263 78 635 0533: It's interesting to hear about the different industries that civil engineers can work in. I hadn't considered some of those options before. It's good to know that there are a variety of career paths available to me.
05/12/23, 12:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So does the course align with your career aspirations?
05/12/23, 12:49 pm - +263 78 635 0533: Yes, the course offerings definitely align with my career aspirations. , It's exciting to know that there are so many different possibilities for civil engineers.
05/12/23, 1:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: If you are provided with this career option How do you see yourself in 5 years after completion of this course and how may Edoofa's Program help you reach your goals?

05/12/23, 3:32 pm - +263 73 523 5162: Thank you Sir enjoy your day as well
05/12/23, 3:46 pm - +263 78 635 0533: Studying in India will help me learn from some of the leading experts in my field.
I will be exposed to new cultures and perspectives which will broaden my horizons and make me a more open- minded and understanding person and this will not only benefit me in my future career but also in my personal life

Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
05/12/23, 4:47 pm - +263 78 635 0533: Yes 
That's why I  decided to apply for the Edoofa scholarship
05/12/23, 4:57 pm - +263 78 635 0533: and I will do my best to work hard keeping in mind  that without a scholarship higher education is expensive <This message was edited>
05/12/23, 5:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Shalom! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
05/12/23, 5:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 5:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, If a student meets and exceeds our academic criteria with a high passing grade, he/she becomes eligible for an exclusive scholarship. With the exclusive Scholarship, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1600-$2300, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc! <This message was edited>
05/12/23, 5:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
05/12/23, 5:59 pm - +263 73 523 5162: Will definitely do our best to pay the reduced fees.
05/12/23, 6:32 pm - +263 78 635 0533: Yes , my parents will do their best .
05/12/23, 7:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Shalom and Mr. Doeswell. Our support doesn't stop there! Edoofa also offers an innovative *Earn While You Learn Program*. This program allows you to further reduce your remaining fees by gaining practical work experience while studying. It not only eases the financial burden but also provides you with valuable skills and industry exposure, enhancing your employability and ensuring a well-rounded education.

With *Edoofa's* exclusive Scholarship and the opportunity to earn while you learn, you can focus on your studies, explore your field of interest, and prepare for a successful career.

So do you want me to guide you about the *Earn while you learn* program in depth?
05/12/23, 8:02 pm - +263 78 635 0533: Yes, that would be very helpful, I'd love to learn more about the Earn while you learn program .
05/12/23, 8:08 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Shalom. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
05/12/23, 8:08 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
05/12/23, 8:08 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
05/12/23, 8:08 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
05/12/23, 8:08 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
05/12/23, 8:08 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
05/12/23, 9:06 pm - +263 78 635 0533: I really appreciate the Webinars and the information they provide. It's great too see how different opportunities can be found in any situation. I think this can be very beneficial.
 The information provided is very encouraging .
05/12/23, 9:10 pm - +263 78 635 0533: I'm impressed by the partnerships that Edoofa has created with these companies. It's great to see that there are opportunities for students to find employment after they complete their education.
05/12/23, 9:14 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2000 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $60-$90 a month
05/12/23, 9:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
05/12/23, 9:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2000, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1000 in the first semester and $1000 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
05/12/23, 9:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

05/12/23, 9:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how you can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on your parents?
05/12/23, 9:50 pm - +263 78 635 0533: Yes, I think the EWYL Program could be a huge help in reducing the financial burden on my parents. It's a great way to earn money and gain valuable experience while still completing my education. I think this program would allow me to make a meaningful contribution to my own education while also supporting my family.
05/12/23, 9:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
05/12/23, 9:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
05/12/23, 9:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
05/12/23, 10:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 7:27 am - +263 78 635 0533: I really appreciate all four points. They all offer unique and valuable benefits for students.
06/12/23, 8:51 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"Believe in the magic within you, for that's where dreams come to life." - Johann Wolfgang von Goethe*

06/12/23, 9:24 am - +263 78 635 0533: Good morning 
I'm ready
06/12/23, 9:44 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Shalom!
06/12/23, 9:44 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Shalom! May I know which one is your favourite, please?
06/12/23, 9:53 am - +263 78 635 0533: The EWYL Program is my favourite.
 I really like the idea of being able to earn money to reduce the cost of my education and gain work experience while still completing my education.
06/12/23, 10:45 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand that your emphasis is on affordability and employability. So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
06/12/23, 10:54 am - +263 78 635 0533: Well,my family is very supportive of my decision to study abroad and they understand that this is an important step in my education and that it will help me become more employable in the future. They're happy that I'm taking this opportunity to expand my horizons and experience a new culture. 
They're a bit nervous about me being so far from home, but they're confident that I'll be successful.
06/12/23, 11:16 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can conclude that you are diligent and possess extreme valor. You will surely prove your mettle if provided with the right path. Moreover, Edoofa is a big family, and I can assure you that you will never feel like an outcast or out of place! Furthermore, Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
06/12/23, 11:17 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Moreover, As *Edoofa* we also prioritize a student's security! That is the reason we are the most trusted organization in Africa with a community of more than 4000 students! Furthermore, after the session, I will connect you with a few of the students who are currently studying in India with us, so that you and your parents can connect with them!
06/12/23, 11:59 am - +263 78 635 0533: Your  words are so kind and encouraging ,it's great to hear that Edoofa prioritizes a sense of community and belonging for its student's ,I'm so glad to hear that studying abroad can have such a positive impact on my career and my family's well-being.
06/12/23, 11:59 am - +263 78 635 0533: I appreciate your commitment to security. I'd love to connect with some of the students who are currently studying in India.
I'd love to learn a lot from these students <This message was edited>
06/12/23, 12:03 pm - +263 77 447 8908: Thank you very much.That will be great we will learn more from their expriences
06/12/23, 1:08 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: It will be my utmost pleasure to guide you through the process, Shalom and Mrs. Precious!
06/12/23, 1:08 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
06/12/23, 2:44 pm - +263 78 635 0533: Yes 
1) Application Form
2) Statement of purpose
3) Letter of recommendation
4)Any other required documents, such as proof of residency
5)Police clearance certificate <This message was edited>
06/12/23, 2:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Correct! Moving on, *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
06/12/23, 2:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
06/12/23, 2:55 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 2:55 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
06/12/23, 3:12 pm - +263 78 635 0533: Thank you sir for the information ,I really appreciate the time and effort you put into gathering this information for me. It's very helpful and much appreciated.
06/12/23, 3:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
06/12/23, 3:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
06/12/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 447 8908: I'm so greatful for the flexible fee option
06/12/23, 4:22 pm - +263 78 635 0533: I'm happy to know that each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out .
06/12/23, 4:31 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
06/12/23, 6:34 pm - +263 78 635 0533: I understand that the financial aspect of the program is very important to consider. It's great to know that Edoofa is helping students figure out how to manage their finances and make payments on their own. I especially appreciate the transparency and clarity that you've provided about the program's fees and payment options. It's a relief to know that everything is laid out in a straightforward way.
06/12/23, 6:38 pm - +263 78 635 0533: I understood that the  (EWYL) program is a way for students to earn credits that can be applied towards their education fees, this is a very unique and helpful program, as it gives students the opportunity to offset the cost of their education while gaining valuable work experience.
06/12/23, 7:58 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc! If you are found eligible for a higher quantum of scholarship, the cost of education will be reduced to $1600-$2300 per annum
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
06/12/23, 8:14 pm - +263 78 635 0533: Okay , Thank you
Noted
06/12/23, 8:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2 changed the group name from "Shalom Chatsauka Edoofa (24/11) SZ" to "Shalom Chatsauka Edoofa (24/11) SZ 2025"
06/12/23, 8:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 8:32 pm - +263 78 635 0533: we have already done a personalized counseling session and we are on the Eligibility check test and interview.
06/12/23, 8:37 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, we are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
06/12/23, 8:43 pm - +263 78 635 0533: Yes
06/12/23, 8:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
06/12/23, 8:55 pm - +263 78 635 0533: Yes sir I am
06/12/23, 9:10 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
06/12/23, 9:10 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

06/12/23, 9:45 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Shalom! As we have collaborated with 250+ universities, it's important to note that each application is unique. The list of universities that your application qualifies for will be provided at a later stage in the process, given that we are currently in the midst of our counseling session!

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
07/12/23, 9:57 am - +263 73 523 5162: Yes I'm ready
07/12/23, 10:05 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please answer all the questions?

07/12/23, 10:28 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
07/12/23, 10:28 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
07/12/23, 10:28 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
07/12/23, 10:28 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 10:29 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 14th or 15th December 2023 for $200 and the 14th  or 15th of January  for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 14th or 15th December 2023. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
07/12/23, 10:37 am - +263 77 447 8908: Option 1
07/12/23, 10:47 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please acknowledge the same using voice notes, please?

07/12/23, 2:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
07/12/23, 2:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
07/12/23, 2:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.

07/12/23, 2:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 14th or 15th December 2023 for $200 and the 14th or 15th of January for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 14th or 15th December 2023. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?

11/12/23, 12:17 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>

Thank you very much
11/12/23, 2:28 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Inform me once you are done <This message was edited>
11/12/23, 3:04 pm - +263 78 635 0533: Sir, I have sent an email acknowledging receipt of the letter, but due to network issues, it has not been delivered yet. However, I have read and understood the contents of the letter, and I am ready to discuss any additional details with you.
11/12/23, 3:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did you and your parents manage to go through your acceptance letter ?
11/12/23, 4:20 pm - +263 77 447 8908: Yes sir we did read the acceptance letter
11/12/23, 4:31 pm - +263 78 635 0533: Yes
11/12/23, 4:40 pm - +263 73 523 5162: Yes we did
11/12/23, 5:03 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So did you check if there are any errors ?
11/12/23, 5:26 pm - +263 78 635 0533: Yes we have checked  and we did not find any errors
11/12/23, 6:51 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So far do you have any questions for me ?
11/12/23, 6:52 pm - +263 77 447 8908: Wich is the best way to pay the fee
11/12/23, 7:09 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
11/12/23, 7:09 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854

11/12/23, 8:42 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I will connect with you *tomorrow again at 10:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead.
