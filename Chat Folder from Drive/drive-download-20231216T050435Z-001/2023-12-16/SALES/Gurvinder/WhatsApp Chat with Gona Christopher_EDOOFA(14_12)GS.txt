15/12/23, 11:35 am - +263 78 144 6358: Yes precisely
15/12/23, 12:37 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Isheanesu, also do tell me whether you learnt about Isheanesu’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
15/12/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 144 6358: Edoofa is an Educational institution that focuses on promoting Higher level education in correspondence with the technologically improving educational system.
Edoofa has more than 10 years of establishment and helping students pursue their careers and lessening the chances of unemployment after end of studies.



The aim of the Edoofa Scholarship programme is to provide the relevant 
knowledge, skills and attitude.
 Through the Edoofa program, students get to follow their passions, gaining crucial employability skills and getting  offers a quality degree and imparts employability skills.
15/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 78 144 6358: I haven't learnt about his journey and experience with the programme.
15/12/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 144 6358: But he shared the documentation about Edoofa which I carefully went through
15/12/23, 3:17 pm - Gurvinder: That is great, let me also brief you about the program.
15/12/23, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
15/12/23, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
15/12/23, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
15/12/23, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
15/12/23, 3:23 pm - +263 78 144 6358: That's clearly stated thank you
15/12/23, 3:24 pm - +263 78 144 6358: That's true
15/12/23, 3:42 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Christopher, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
15/12/23, 3:44 pm - +263 78 144 6358: Yes I do.
15/12/23, 3:44 pm - Gurvinder: Now Christopher, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
15/12/23, 4:05 pm - +263 78 144 6358: My highest level of education is advanced level where I studied Mathematics,Physics, Chemistry and Computer Science throughout this year. I am inspired to study Eeronautical Engineering as per my personal aims and goals to become an aeronautical engineer. I chose Aeronautical Engineering because I discovered that throughout my education I have always wondered and researched more on the design, manufacture and operation of aerospace vehicles.
I have a single parent supporting me educationally, financially and emotionally to aim higher in my studies and pursuing my career who is my mother. She is self employed and she works as a maid in Botswana. Her highest level of education is ordinary level with uncollected final examination results due to different reasons. She will be supporting me financially in my studies abroad during the whole course of higher education. I don't have any siblings as I'm the only child in this small desolate family.
I studied my advanced level education at a school called Nyashanu High School in Buhera District in the Manicaland province. The school costed $580USD per term for all advanced level students studying science subjects
