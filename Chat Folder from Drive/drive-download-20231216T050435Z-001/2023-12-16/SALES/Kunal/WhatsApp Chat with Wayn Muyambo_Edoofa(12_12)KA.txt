What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship? learn that the Edoofa program has a application process where you are required to share your education and family background in details for the selection process . However because the program is so widespread and receive hundreds of application daily it not only takes time for your application to come through but also makes the nature of the scholarship more competitive 

Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)?I accepted into the Edoofa program because of it's authenticity and affordability and I was already in touch with students who have at different universities in India studying various courses at the most affordable cost
