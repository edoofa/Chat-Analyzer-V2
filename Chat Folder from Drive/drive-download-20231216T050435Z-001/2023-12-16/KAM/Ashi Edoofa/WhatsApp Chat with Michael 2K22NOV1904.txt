I hope this message finds you well. I am *Mr. Shivjeet, Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As per our commitment, following the successful closure of the 2023 intake, I am delighted to inform you that we are now fully prepared to commence the university application process for your higher studies, targeting the intake of 2024. 

Before we embark on your admission journey, I'd like to inquire about your well-being and that of your family. How have the past few months been for you and your family?

09/09/23, 7:54 pm - +263 71 327 0701: My apology for a late response.

So, may I kindly inquire if you are prepared to initiate the admission process at this time?
18/09/23, 4:55 pm - +263 78 015 2306: I am ma'am
 although I thought this process would start after I had received my A level results
18/09/23, 5:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, that is accurate. Additionally, we can consider advancing the admission process by utilizing the statement of Entry, offering specific benefits which will be thoroughly discussed in our upcoming session. Could you confirm if this approach aligns with your understanding?
18/09/23, 5:02 pm - +263 78 015 2306: Thank you for clarifying
18/09/23, 5:03 pm - +263 78 015 2306: It does align
18/09/23, 5:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to see that. Given our strong enthusiasm and meticulous preparation to advance your admission process, I would greatly appreciate your confirmation of your readiness to embark on this journey. So, may I kindly inquire if you are prepared to initiate the admission process at this time?
18/09/23, 5:09 pm - +263 78 015 2306: I am prepared I'm sure we can proceed
18/09/23, 5:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's wonderful to hear, and I'm thrilled to know you're ready to kickstart your admission process. Your commitment to this journey is greatly appreciated. 

Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Mechanical Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
18/09/23, 5:15 pm - +263 78 015 2306: Very accurate
18/09/23, 5:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Along with that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
18/09/23, 5:44 pm - +263 78 015 2306: Apologies I had bad connection the pictures are loading now
18/09/23, 5:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, I shall wait for the same.
18/09/23, 6:44 pm - +263 78 015 2306: <Media omitted>
18/09/23, 6:46 pm - +263 78 015 2306: <Media omitted>
18/09/23, 6:47 pm - +263 78 015 2306: <Media omitted>
18/09/23, 6:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/09/23, 6:50 pm - +263 78 015 2306: Ok thank you
I am also excited to proceed with my academic journey
18/09/23, 6:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  So, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure.?
18/09/23, 6:59 pm - +263 78 015 2306: Yes
18/09/23, 7:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
18/09/23, 7:13 pm - +263 78 015 2306: I do not understand the question am I supposed to share my understanding on the importance of the offer letter and administration process
18/09/23, 7:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you here, the above context is requesting you to share your understanding of the previous steps that have been already covered. May I know if we are clear here?
18/09/23, 7:27 pm - +263 78 015 2306: Ok now we are 

So the first step is basically the EDOOFA officials replying your request to join the scholarship program when accepted you move to the next stage where you fill a statement of purpose with general questions mostly about your aspirations , dreams and how you think the scholarship will help you. You then move on to the next stage where you are helped by a professional counselor (8n my case it was Mr. Piyush) who helps in career selection and alternative choices. The next step is the university admission process where the admission officers help you choose a university of your choice
18/09/23, 7:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
18/09/23, 7:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
18/09/23, 7:30 pm - +263 78 015 2306: We are sir
18/09/23, 7:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
18/09/23, 7:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
18/09/23, 7:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
18/09/23, 7:40 pm - +263 78 015 2306: I am sir
18/09/23, 8:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
18/09/23, 8:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
18/09/23, 8:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
18/09/23, 8:21 pm - +263 78 015 2306: I have you can explain them sir
18/09/23, 8:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
18/09/23, 8:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them.

Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
18/09/23, 9:07 pm - +263 78 015 2306: Understood
18/09/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
18/09/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
18/09/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/09/23, 9:36 pm - +263 78 015 2306: That's great I am also pleased by the extent Edoofa has to go to provide the best for it's students
18/09/23, 10:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
18/09/23, 10:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/09/23, 10:09 pm - +263 78 015 2306: It does sir 
If I may ask How long are you given to pay 600 dollars after receiving the letter of Intent
18/09/23, 10:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Since it is late and it has been a long day for me, and the available hours are coming to an end, we shall proceed with our session tomorrow afternoon at 3:00 PM. I hope this works for you, and have a great night.
18/09/23, 10:23 pm - +263 78 015 2306: Same to you sir
19/09/23, 7:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Michael,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. I was not able to connect with you as I was occupied with retrieving our proud Edooﬁans from the airport. I would like to share a glimpse of this experience with my students. Along with that, I would like to reschedule our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM. I hope this timing works for you. Have a great day!
19/09/23, 7:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 9:52 pm - +263 78 015 2306: Evening sir 
I also apologize I am still having bad connection
19/09/23, 9:52 pm - +263 78 015 2306: Wow did they arrive today ?
20/09/23, 2:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon! I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. How are you enjoying this lovely afternoon?
20/09/23, 3:17 pm - +263 71 327 0701: Very well Sir hope you are all fine too
20/09/23, 3:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm doing wonderfully, thank you for inquiring. Are you prepared and ready for our session?
20/09/23, 3:38 pm - +263 71 327 0701: Let me find out wih my Son at home Sir, it might be a connection issue bt ready for the priceedings.
20/09/23, 3:39 pm - +263 78 015 2306: I am sir apologies I was at school but I'm off now
20/09/23, 3:40 pm - +263 71 327 0701: Michael ill be joining us soon Sir was on his way from school
20/09/23, 3:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. I am now continuing with the session.
20/09/23, 3:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
20/09/23, 3:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
20/09/23, 3:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 23, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 30, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 23, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
20/09/23, 3:50 pm - +263 78 015 2306: Understood sir
20/09/23, 3:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
20/09/23, 3:55 pm - +263 78 015 2306: No I'm not familiar sir
20/09/23, 4:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
20/09/23, 4:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
20/09/23, 4:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
20/09/23, 4:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
20/09/23, 4:25 pm - +263 78 015 2306: Thank you for clarifying sir
20/09/23, 4:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
20/09/23, 4:28 pm - +263 78 015 2306: Yes
20/09/23, 4:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
20/09/23, 4:42 pm - +263 78 015 2306: I agree
20/09/23, 4:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
20/09/23, 4:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
20/09/23, 4:46 pm - +263 78 015 2306: Understood sir
20/09/23, 4:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
20/09/23, 4:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
20/09/23, 4:52 pm - +263 78 015 2306: Understood sir
20/09/23, 4:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
20/09/23, 4:57 pm - +263 78 015 2306: Noted
20/09/23, 4:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
20/09/23, 5:00 pm - +263 78 015 2306: No queries sir
20/09/23, 5:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to what that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving his offer letter?
20/09/23, 5:09 pm - +263 78 015 2306: Yes sir I am
20/09/23, 5:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for your application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information. <This message was edited>

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
27/09/23, 1:10 pm - +263 78 015 2306: 1. 1000
2. 4 years
3. 300
4. 750
27/09/23, 1:13 pm - +263 71 327 0701: We are doing well Sir and very much pleased to receive the letter Sir.  We are ready for the discussion Sir
27/09/23, 1:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a four-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 8 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $1000 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($1000*2) = $2000. I hope you are clear about this.
27/09/23, 1:25 pm - +263 78 015 2306: clear sir
27/09/23, 1:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
27/09/23, 1:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
27/09/23, 1:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
27/09/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 015 2306: So is this accommodation fee added to the tuition fee?
27/09/23, 1:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, in order to see the total per annum expenses, this accommodation fee would be added to the tuition fee. Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
27/09/23, 1:46 pm - +263 78 015 2306: We are
27/09/23, 1:47 pm - +263 71 327 0701: If I may ask also on the admission and procedure fees. I have     seen that the $300 is given 15 days from the day of receiving the offer letter which means we are left with 14 working days now. Now my 2nd question is   when is  the registration fee $750 due from now Sir
27/09/23, 1:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: We are coming to discuss that @263713270701 ! Now, As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
27/09/23, 1:52 pm - +263 71 327 0701: Clear Sir
27/09/23, 1:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
27/09/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 015 2306: So is the 300 subtracted from the 750 once you pay
27/09/23, 2:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for bringing up that question. No, the $300 admission and processing fee, which has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme, is separate from the $750 registration fee. So, you won't subtract the $300 from the $750. The registration fee is $750, and it's a one-time payment required to secure your scholarship seat at Galgotias University. I hope this is clear?
27/09/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 015 2306: Clear
27/09/23, 2:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
27/09/23, 2:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 10th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 10th November 2023.*
27/09/23, 2:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *10th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
27/09/23, 3:24 pm - +263 71 327 0701: Thanks for clarity. May I ask if you happen ro have a representative in Bulawayo
27/09/23, 3:29 pm - +263 71 327 0701: Last time We used Mr S Kawadza's acc if I may ask if he is another option or maybe in this case not?
27/09/23, 3:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
27/09/23, 3:45 pm - +263 71 327 0701: Yes please do
27/09/23, 3:47 pm - +263 71 327 0701: Also even if you have onother associate in Bulawayo as well.
27/09/23, 4:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, if making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333038009240398
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
27/09/23, 7:50 pm - +263 71 327 0701: Thank you so much Sir I will consider one of those options...
28/09/23, 10:16 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Michael!
I hope you are doing well today.
28/09/23, 10:16 am - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
28/09/23, 10:16 am - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
28/09/23, 10:19 am - +263 78 015 2306: Hello sir and good morning
28/09/23, 10:22 am - +263 78 015 2306: Ok
28/09/23, 10:26 am - +263 71 327 0701: Good morning we are all good hope you are too.
28/09/23, 10:36 am - +263 71 327 0701: If I may ask on the off campus issue : It's a bit more cheaper but how about the services there, since it is University approved does it offer the same services as those to on campus as well eg access to library, internet etc...  Also how is the transport situation to students.
28/09/23, 1:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes, therefore no need for transport, hence eliminating the transport costs.

Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students. I hope this clears the doubt that you have here, right?
28/09/23, 2:00 pm - +263 71 327 0701: Well answered Sir am very clear now. Thanks  for clarity.
28/09/23, 2:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
28/09/23, 2:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
28/09/23, 2:04 pm - +263 71 327 0701: Clear Sir.
28/09/23, 2:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
28/09/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 015 2306: Clear sir
28/09/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 015 2306: It does sir
28/09/23, 2:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
28/09/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 015 2306: Just to be sure you said the university  officials also  help you in securing this off campus accommodation right
28/09/23, 2:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Absolutely, you are correct. The university officials are there to assist you in securing off-campus accommodation as well.  On top of that you would also have the support of the Department of Student Welfare here at Edoofa in doing so, which means that your initial days here in India will be as smooth as possible.
28/09/23, 2:42 pm - +263 78 015 2306: Noted 
thats all I wanted to ask you can proceed with sharing the university insights
28/09/23, 3:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
28/09/23, 3:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa. 

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

I wanted to let you know that it's reassuring seeing how the university hosts quite a number of international students especially from Africa
28/09/23, 3:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: You're very welcome! I'm glad to hear that you find it reassuring to know that the university hosts a diverse community of international students, including those from Africa. This diversity can greatly enrich your cultural and academic experience, as you'll have the opportunity to interact with students from different backgrounds and learn from each other.
28/09/23, 3:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I would encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

I trust this message finds you in good health. I am Ms. Ashi, the Admission Officer at Edoofa. I am pleased to inform you that the payment of your registration fee has been confirmed by the accounts team and we have updated the university officials on the same.

As per the updates we have from the admissions team, they are hopeful to get updates from Lovely Professional University as well for your application, we are waiting for the same so that you have another scholarship offer and you can make a well-informed decision for your higher education and then the university will process your provisional admission acceptance letter.
23/11/23, 8:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Additionally , Since your admission intake is for August 2024, you will be working on the visa requirements for now and towards the month of April 2024 when the universities release the tentative arrival dates for the upcoming batch. That is when you will be visiting the embassy to submit your documents and process your visa application further. I hope you are clear on this?
27/11/23, 3:04 pm - +263 78 015 2306: Great news
27/11/23, 3:04 pm - +263 78 015 2306: Noted
27/11/23, 3:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Michael, I hope you are doing. 

I am glad to see that you have gone through my message.
27/11/23, 3:31 pm - +263 78 015 2306: We went through it sir.
Although I have onw question if my application is successful at Lovely Professional University can I choose it over Galgotias and if so is the tuition fee still the same or it varies from University to University ?
27/11/23, 3:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you here @263780152306 -

Once you gave the team a go-ahead to proceed with your university admission process, your application was shared with multiple universities which were applicable to your course and were recommended by the Academic Board. Lovely Professional University is one of those universities and they are currently evaluating your application, and if they decide to offer a scholarship to you, they will send you an offer letter.
27/11/23, 3:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: After getting another offer letter, if you decide to change your university to LPU from Galgotias University, you will be able to do the same without paying any additional amount of money. However, if you feel comfortable with your current choice, you can go ahead with the same. Are you clear on this?
27/11/23, 4:08 pm - +263 78 015 2306: Ok thank you for clarifying
27/11/23, 4:09 pm - +263 78 015 2306: Clear

I trust that you and your family are doing well today. I am pleased to connect with you today. In light of your admission process, I would like to share some exciting news with you regarding your admission process with the university. 

As we have shared with you earlier that your application is in process with Lovely Professional University, I would like to share that they have mentioned that they would be able to give us an update by the month of January, considering the high volume of applications they have received in the past two months (more than 2000 applications). <This message was edited>
14/12/23, 3:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In addition to this, the academic board also mentioned that there are a few more universities willing to put your application in consideration for scholarship opportunities in the month of January. Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter. This approach allows you to have multiple scholarship options, giving you the flexibility to decide on the university for your education in India and then carry out your visa application process the right way.
14/12/23, 3:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this update, I also want to inform you that since we are waiting for updates from the universities, we will be holding our conversation until 20th January and will reconnect around the same time. Until then, we wanted to share these updates with you so that you are well-informed about the process and know what lies ahead. We are thrilled to be a part of this new chapter in your academic journey.
14/12/23, 3:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, now that you are done with your admission process, you are encouraged to channel your energy and focus on your Earn While You Learn (EWYL) journey so that you can maximize the benefits from it. May this period be filled with meaningful learning, personal growth, and amazing opportunities. 

If you are not connected with your EWYL Mentor or if you have any queries/concerns related to your admission journey, please feel free to reach out to us and we will do our best to assist you!
