This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India. <This message was edited>
07/09/23, 9:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Kuvimbanashe EWYL23E0651)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session on next Monday, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups? <This message was edited>

08/09/23, 10:06 pm - +263 77 228 2821: He may not be able to engage in the program immediately. Until maybe in late or mid November. If the prior meeting had been convened a little bit earlier maybe he would have started on something before he went back.

12/09/23, 2:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, we shall connect at the said time frame.
12/09/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Good afternoon. If it's okay to continue without the Father let's do so. But if you have already rescheduled for 7:30pm. It's still okay.
12/09/23, 2:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/09/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Okay. Let me go through.
12/09/23, 2:58 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Yes, I have gone through. We can explain further in detail.
12/09/23, 2:59 pm - +263 77 228 2821: You can explain further
12/09/23, 3:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
12/09/23, 3:09 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Noted
12/09/23, 3:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
12/09/23, 3:18 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Oh okay.... This will refer to the student.
12/09/23, 3:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is indeed correct.
12/09/23, 3:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
12/09/23, 3:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
12/09/23, 3:24 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Following indeed
12/09/23, 4:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
12/09/23, 4:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
12/09/23, 6:54 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Following. This is clear. But just need to ask that.... Once a student has started with the projects how long would that finally take him to reach to the Registration and Acceptance stage (step 5).
12/09/23, 7:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, Kindly excuse me for the late reply, our available hours for the first slot have just ended.
12/09/23, 7:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concern with me. Allow me to address your concern: Every student enrolled in the Edoofa program is guaranteed a scholarship offer from one of India's top universities. Just to clarify, students do not need to complete projects to be eligible for the acceptance stage. I hope this clears things up.
12/09/23, 8:03 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Noted. Thank you
12/09/23, 8:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
13/09/23, 2:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Kuvimbanashe!

I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed. May I know if you are facing any challenges?
13/09/23, 3:24 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Good afternoon. Yes we received this last message. We had no question.
13/09/23, 3:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
13/09/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Please go ahead.
13/09/23, 3:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
13/09/23, 3:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
13/09/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Am still at work so maybe if we can have the videos a bit later.
13/09/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. I am sharing the videos now and you can watch them when you are free.
13/09/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

13/09/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait that distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

13/09/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
13/09/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
13/09/23, 3:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding.
13/09/23, 3:59 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Thank you.
14/09/23, 12:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Dear Parents and Kuvimbanashe, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that positive note I am here to continue with your session for the admission process.

14/09/23, 12:49 pm - +263 77 238 0731: We watched the videos but we may need to go through them again before we summarize to avoid missing out on important points.
14/09/23, 8:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, Kindly excuse me for the late reply, our available hours for the first slot have just ended and I was occupied with a meeting. Certainly, please let me know when you are done with the rewatching of the videos.

15/09/23, 7:31 pm - +263 77 228 2821: The major point to note being that students and parents should be able to to follow instructions and be open minded.
15/09/23, 7:34 pm - +263 77 228 2821: The vision and expectations of Edoofa is to create opportunities for the students. To increase students' capacity to success.
15/09/23, 7:39 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Edoofa has taken years of hardworking and a lot of resources to come up with the good schools, colleges and universities they work with. They have looked for schools with certain accreditation. Not just schools but those that have gone through approvals and which are run by families of educationists. A lot of investment has been done by Edoofa in coming up or identifying the great schools. These are schools worthy sending our children to.
15/09/23, 7:44 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Children should have the  right kind of attitudes, requirements and knowledge to achieve the best. The challenges they meet in school will also equip them for better opportunities, in business and in their work life. Students must be able to serve and build their communities through networking. Edoofa offers value learning program therefore children must prepare and be qualified for these prestigious universities.
15/09/23, 7:46 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Lastly but not least, there must be physical and mental preparedness for the interactive sessions with schools. Statement of purpose requires the students to be resourceful, be able to mobilise and become diligent.
15/09/23, 7:47 pm - +263 77 228 2821: This is what we have managed to follow from the studios. If there is anything that we have missed please highlight that to us.
15/09/23, 8:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents Kuvimbanashe. I hope you are well and blessed. May I know if you are ready to further proceed with the session? <This message was edited>
15/09/23, 8:21 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Yes we are ready.
15/09/23, 8:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
15/09/23, 8:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
15/09/23, 8:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
15/09/23, 8:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
15/09/23, 8:46 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Yes we are on the same page.
15/09/23, 8:47 pm - +263 77 228 2821: You have simplified your explanation everything is clear now.
15/09/23, 9:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
15/09/23, 9:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Monday 1:30 PM.
15/09/23, 9:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

03/10/23, 5:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that cheerful note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

May I know if you are currently available at the moment to proceed with the session?
03/10/23, 5:19 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Good afternoon. Yes we can proceed.
03/10/23, 5:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
03/10/23, 5:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BCom  and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
03/10/23, 6:18 pm - +263 77 228 2821: It's B. Com in Accounting
03/10/23, 7:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. I have taken note of it. In the meantime, shall we proceed with the session for the admission process?
03/10/23, 8:35 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Yes please.
03/10/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
03/10/23, 9:22 pm - +263 77 238 0731: Yes, let's proceed.
03/10/23, 9:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
03/10/23, 9:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
03/10/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
03/10/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
03/10/23, 9:42 pm - +263 77 238 0731: Following
03/10/23, 10:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
03/10/23, 10:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
03/10/23, 10:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
03/10/23, 10:48 pm - +263 77 238 0731: Sure the registration fee was discussed
04/10/23, 4:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon,

*When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it. -Henry Ford*

With that cheerful note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

May I know if you are currently available at the moment to proceed with the session?
04/10/23, 4:50 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Good afternoon. We may proceed.
04/10/23, 5:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
04/10/23, 5:53 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Following
04/10/23, 6:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
04/10/23, 6:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
04/10/23, 6:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
04/10/23, 6:57 pm - +263 77 228 2821: So it will be $2800 plus $750.....to make it $3550 which is more than the amounts mentioned above of between $2000 and $3000.
04/10/23, 7:11 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Again, it may not be possible to pay or raise $750 in 2 weeks.
04/10/23, 7:18 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Unless maybe this amount would not be paid like now,
04/10/23, 8:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand that it might be a challenge. Please do not worry about it right now. You will be informed well in advance about the deadlines so that you can prepare the finances in a timely manner. May I know if you are clear to proceed?
04/10/23, 8:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
04/10/23, 8:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
04/10/23, 9:02 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Thank you. It's clear now.
04/10/23, 9:39 pm - +263 77 238 0731: It's clear but I have a few questions:
From the previous discussions, (1) it was indicated that the registration fees are between $500 and $750, is this position still standing or it's strictly $750?,
(2) We were given the impression that with the Edoofa program, the fees will be between $2 000 & $3 000 which could also go down with the EWYL program credits, is this still applicable?
(3) The time frame indicated for the payment of the registration fees of two weeks is too short as we do not earn that much in one month. Is there a possibility to spread the registration fees so that we mobilise resources within our reach?
(3) Kuvimbanashe is yet to submit the SOP because he is away at the boarding school, did you take note of that?
04/10/23, 9:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sorry to say that I will not be further available to proceed with our session for now, as unforeseen work has come up that requires my assistance. Let us connect tomorrow evening at 5:00 PM. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
04/10/23, 9:53 pm - +263 77 238 0731: Thank you and good night to you too.
05/10/23, 5:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and My dear student. 

How are you doing this lovely afternoon?
05/10/23, 5:32 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Good afternoon Shivjeet Sir.
05/10/23, 5:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings. If you are ready shall we proceed with the session.
05/10/23, 5:36 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Let's proceed.
05/10/23, 5:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your understanding and your question. Typically, universities provide a reasonable window of time for students to gather and submit the registration fee. This duration can vary depending on the specific university and its policies. Please do not worry about it right now. And is well noted that the SOP is on hold for now it can be resumed once he gets back.
05/10/23, 5:47 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Well understood. Thank you.
05/10/23, 6:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For the University Registration Fee, ranging from $500 to $750, constitutes a component of your total university tuition fees. This fee is necessary to secure your seat at the university and is required to be paid before the start of your session while you are at your home, by the student/parent/guardian. It's important to understand that this amount is not an additional charge, it will be subtracted from your first year's tuition fees. and It depends on the university but it will fall under $500 to $750. I hope we are on the same page here?
05/10/23, 6:35 pm - +263 77 228 2821: We are on the same page. Thank you please for clarifying.
05/10/23, 7:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
05/10/23, 7:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
05/10/23, 7:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
05/10/23, 7:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
05/10/23, 8:57 pm - +263 77 238 0731: No questions at the moment.
05/10/23, 9:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have completely understood the admission process. Now, moving forward, I recently reviewed your application form once again and noted your preference to commence your EWYL journey in November 2023. Considering the reasons you've provided and the date of commencement in mind, we are prepared to initiate your EWYL program in November as agreed upon.
05/10/23, 9:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the meantime, we will focus on your admission journey. Now that you have a clear understanding of the admission process, I encourage you to have a discussion with your family regarding the financial requirements. This will allow them to plan effectively and move in the right direction.
05/10/23, 9:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Given that your university admission is scheduled for the August 2024 intake, our next step is to reconnect with you and discuss when to commence the same journey. 

We have scheduled our session for Tomorrow at 3:00 p.m. to begin the admission process. Please ensure that both you and your parents are available for this session. We understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise, and if, for any reason, you or your parents cannot connect as planned, kindly inform us in advance.
09/10/23, 3:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and My dear student. 

I trust you had a restful weekend with your family. Kidly excuse me for not being able to connect with you. May I kindly inquire if you are presently available to continue with our session?
12/10/23, 4:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
12/10/23, 4:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*
12/10/23, 4:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
12/10/23, 4:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
12/10/23, 4:44 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Let's proceed.
12/10/23, 4:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
12/10/23, 4:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
12/10/23, 4:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioningas a frontiersperson in this endeavor.
12/10/23, 4:50 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Following
12/10/23, 4:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
12/10/23, 4:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
12/10/23, 4:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
12/10/23, 4:53 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Following
12/10/23, 4:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
12/10/23, 4:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
12/10/23, 5:01 pm - +263 77 228 2821: It does resonates and it's quite good an arrangement.
12/10/23, 5:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
12/10/23, 5:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
12/10/23, 5:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
12/10/23, 6:32 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Following
12/10/23, 6:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
12/10/23, 7:44 pm - +263 77 238 0731: You can kindly shed more light on that.
12/10/23, 7:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
12/10/23, 7:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
12/10/23, 7:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
12/10/23, 7:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
12/10/23, 7:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
12/10/23, 7:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
12/10/23, 8:07 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Yes we can see that. Following
12/10/23, 8:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
12/10/23, 8:16 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Yes we understand but we are not opting for this scenario.
12/10/23, 8:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then. <This message was edited>
12/10/23, 8:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
12/10/23, 8:59 pm - +263 77 238 0731: This option is not yet applicable since he is yet to sit for the A Level exams.
12/10/23, 9:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, indeed. But if the results turn out to be unsuccessful, it will be applicable. May I know if you are clear to proceed?
12/10/23, 9:08 pm - +263 77 238 0731: Let's proceed
12/10/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
12/10/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
12/10/23, 9:13 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Following
12/10/23, 9:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
12/10/23, 9:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
13/10/23, 7:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening,

I hope you are doing well and are as excited as we are approaching the upcoming weeks. Please do excuse me for the late reply. I was occupied with a meeting with the admission team. I am happy to say that I am now available to take your session. If you are currently available for the session, please do let me know so that we can further proceed with the session.
13/10/23, 8:03 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Good evening. Yes, we can proceed.
13/10/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Kuvimbanashe's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Kuvimbanashe is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
13/10/23, 9:51 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Yes yes
13/10/23, 9:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Kuvimbanashe's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
13/10/23, 10:02 pm - +263 77 238 0731: Thank you.
17/10/23, 11:04 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Kuvimbanashe,

18/10/23, 2:24 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this with me, @263772282821. If I may inquire, do you have a prior commitment at the same time, which might prevent you from connecting with us at that specific time?
18/10/23, 4:11 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Yes yes we will be ready for that at the prescribed time.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
18/10/23, 7:58 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
18/10/23, 8:04 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Good evening Vilsha
18/10/23, 8:09 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Yes we have gone through the OL. We have understood what is being said. You need to clarify on the issue of the 50% scholarship given and the time frame given on the payment of the processing fees.
18/10/23, 8:10 pm - +263 77 228 2821: In relationship with the fees shown there per semester.
18/10/23, 8:15 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your questions and we have taken note of them @263772282821, I am glad to see that you have jotted down the questions you have on your mind, and rest assured all of them will be addressed. 

As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
18/10/23, 8:15 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
18/10/23, 8:20 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Yes we are ready with the discussion.
18/10/23, 8:34 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright please. Now that we are all set to discuss Kuvimbanashe's offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
18/10/23, 8:34 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s Kuvimbanashe's per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
18/10/23, 8:46 pm - +263 77 228 2821: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 8:53 pm - +263 77 228 2821: 1. 900 Usd per semester
2. 3 years ( 6 semesters)
3. 300 Usd (Waived upon early registration)
4. 750 USd
18/10/23, 9:04 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in Kuvimbanashe's offer letter, his course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for his degree. 

With the scholarship offered, his tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means his annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
18/10/23, 9:50 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Yes.
18/10/23, 10:04 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am pleased that we have been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
18/10/23, 10:04 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well. <This message was edited>
18/10/23, 10:05 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, Kuvimbanashe can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- Kuvimbanashe will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist him in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, Kuvimbanashe as a student can also look for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses. <This message was edited>
19/10/23, 1:09 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Noted.
19/10/23, 1:22 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, @263772282821. It is great to hear that you're following our conversation and were able to take note of the same. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. 

Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
19/10/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Well noted. Thank you.
19/10/23, 2:11 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome @263772282821. Continuing the discussion regarding Mazvita's offer letter, now as you can see in the offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
19/10/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 228 2821: It's Kuvimbanashe's offer letter not Mazvita.
19/10/23, 2:14 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Kindly excuse me, @263772282821. I was interacting with one of our other students, and it seems like I mistakenly used her name while addressing Kuvimbanashe. I have edited the message so that we can be on the same page. I appreciate your attention to such details.
19/10/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Thank you for that.
19/10/23, 2:42 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for understanding and it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to Kuvimbanashe's overall cost of education.
19/10/23, 2:42 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, your *deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on October 31st, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
19/10/23, 3:37 pm - +263 77 228 2821: We are together but this might not be possible to raise 750 USD within 15 days especially to people who does not own a business here in Zimbabwe. It's almost impossible the truth being said.
19/10/23, 3:39 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Considering that we are following up this scholarship it already shows that money is not that easy to get otherwise we would not have opted for the scholarship route.
19/10/23, 3:57 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I do understand the concern you have @263772282821 and thank you for sharing this with me. On the same note, as you can see the admission and processing fee of $300 has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme & the Endowment Plan for Edoofian and will not be added to Kuvimbanashe's cost of education.

This special gesture has been granted to the students, considering the economic challenges in Zimbabwe and the financial priori commitments parents have in place. However, it's essential to understand that you are competing for an international scholarship, and students from all over the world are vying for this scholarship seat. Given this, universities have to establish timelines to provide equal opportunities to all students.
19/10/23, 3:58 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Considering our goal and in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to Kuvimbanashe through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that he is entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee thereby resolving the challenge you have. Would you like me to explain how this works?
19/10/23, 4:23 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Yes please.
19/10/23, 4:46 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on Kuvimabanashe's behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $300 before the first deadline date of *October 31st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $300 before the second deadline date of *November 30th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
19/10/23, 4:46 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Kuvimbanashe's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before October 31st, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
20/10/23, 10:20 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning, Parents and Kuvimbanashe,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits. In our conversation yesterday, we were in the midst of addressing crucial aspects related to your university admission and the scholarship offer letter from Galgotias University.

However, halfway through our discussion, we did not receive a response from your end, and consequently, I have been expecting a reply from you. Could you please confirm if you had the opportunity to go through my previous messages and if we are still connected with each other?
20/10/23, 10:31 am - +263 77 228 2821: Good morning. We are supposed to meet at 1pm. However the contents have been noted and we will see if we will be able to raise the funds. Otherwise we are still connected with each other.
20/10/23, 10:43 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are still connected. Thank you for confirming, and I appreciate your acknowledgment of the contents. However, I did not fully understand your message. Did you mean that you plan to meet with your family at 1:00 PM to discuss financial planning or would you be connecting with us at the same time for a discussion? Could you please clarify if I have interpreted your message correctly?
20/10/23, 10:46 am - +263 77 228 2821: I just meant that I had responded assuming that we were going to convene today at 1 pm,
20/10/23, 10:47 am - +263 77 228 2821: Thank you for the follow up.
20/10/23, 10:48 am - +263 77 228 2821: It shows that you are concerned about Kuvimbanashe's scholarship success.
20/10/23, 10:58 am - Vilsha Edoofa: You are welcome, @263772282821, and thank you for your understanding. We indeed genuinely care about Kuvimbanashe's scholarship success, and I am here to support and guide you every step of the way.
20/10/23, 10:59 am - Vilsha Edoofa: With that said, since we were in the middle of our discussion regarding Kuvimbanashe's offer letter from Galgotias University, may I inquire if we can proceed with our discussion right now so that we aim to complete it today? This way, you will have all the necessary details, and you can focus on completing your child's university admission formalities in a timely manner.
20/10/23, 11:06 am - +263 77 228 2821: At the moment am busy at work. Can we do it at 1 pm
20/10/23, 11:11 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I have taken note of the timings you shared, @263772282821. However, I am afraid that I will not be available at the same time, as I have prior commitments from 11:00 am to 7:00 pm. Therefore, I will be available to connect with you after 7:00 pm. Could you please confirm if you'll be available to connect with us at 7:30 pm so that I can adjust my schedule and connect with you accordingly?
20/10/23, 11:11 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I hope you are aware that in consideration of the time difference between India and Zimbabwe, our operational hours are typically scheduled from 08:00 am to 04:00 pm CAT. However, we recognize that parents sometimes have work commitments or they are unavailable to connect due to network challenges during the day.

Therefore, we occasionally extend our availability and schedule operational hours in the evening to assist parents promptly. With that said, I have been available for the parents from 08:00 am to 12:00 am every day this week and hence I am sure you understand that this might not be feasible for me on a daily basis.
20/10/23, 11:12 am - Vilsha Edoofa: But considering the importance of our discussion and the offer letter you have, for today, I can certainly accommodate and connect with your family in the evening at 7:30 PM. <This message was edited>
20/10/23, 11:13 am - Vilsha Edoofa: But @263772282821 considering the time difference, it will be quite late, around 11:00 PM here in India. Therefore, we can only stretch our conversation for an hour or two. Since we are scheduling this discussion specifically for you and your family, could you please confirm if the network will be stable and if you will be actively available?
20/10/23, 11:18 am - +263 77 228 2821: At this juncture I am not sure if there is much to discuss as you have given us what your position at that end.... It's now up to the family to see if this is feasible. In that case.... Will it not be okay if we can reconnect again on Monday the 23rd. If it's okay with you.
20/10/23, 11:24 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I can understand you @263772282821 and it is great to know that you wish to have a discussion with your family regarding the finances. However, ma'am, we couldn't finish our discussion yesterday, and there are still crucial details related to the offer letter that is important for you to understand. Once we complete our discussion, it would be then wise for you to take your time, sit with your family, and have a conversation so that you can make well-informed decisions.

Without these details, your discussion may not be as effective. I hope you agree and can see the importance of addressing these concerns?
20/10/23, 11:46 am - +263 77 228 2821: Okay. Noted.
20/10/23, 11:54 am - +263 77 228 2821: We can go ahead.
20/10/23, 7:31 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation. With regards to our last conversation, now that we are clear with the payment plan, I would also like to move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
20/10/23, 7:31 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
20/10/23, 7:33 pm - +263 77 228 2821: We reside in Harare
20/10/23, 7:33 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
20/10/23, 7:33 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
20/10/23, 7:33 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
20/10/23, 7:34 pm - +263 77 228 2821: That would be fine.
20/10/23, 7:36 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
20/10/23, 7:36 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 11% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
20/10/23, 7:37 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Mr Charles Jerera's details we already have.
20/10/23, 7:38 pm - +263 77 228 2821: If we are to use the cash method what proof of payment are we given for the records.
20/10/23, 7:40 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Oh I had missed that. It's there at the top.
20/10/23, 7:44 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, @263772282821. If making the payment is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
20/10/23, 7:52 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Thank you. My phone is running low on battery... I have not had a chance to charge it.
20/10/23, 7:54 pm - +263 77 228 2821: May shut down any minute. I hope we have discussed the important points for today.
20/10/23, 8:26 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I understand @263772282821, we need a couple of more minutes to conclude our discussion and I hope you will be able to connect with us till then. Since we have been able to establish your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
20/10/23, 8:26 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
20/10/23, 8:26 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
20/10/23, 8:26 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
21/10/23, 7:24 am - +263 77 228 2821: Good morning. Sorry to come back on a weekend. You can still come back on Monday. Want to ask on that amount of the annual fee of $2800. Last time we spoke about 900 per semester to make it $1800. So am confused now.....
21/10/23, 7:38 am - +263 77 228 2821: I understand. I hope you will explain further on how this is done. Thank you. Enjoy your weekend.
26/10/23, 8:59 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening to the Parents and Kuvimbanashe,

I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I have gone through the message you shared and I would like to express my sincere apologies for the recent delay in our communications. Over the past few days, India has been celebrating a festive season, including significant cultural events such as Durga Puja and Dussehra. These occasions are marked by vibrant processions, traditional rituals, and joyful gatherings.
26/10/23, 9:02 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Due to these festivities, our communications were briefly interrupted. Now that we are back in regular operation, I would like to re-establish our discussions. I understand that our time zone differences have presented challenges in coordinating our conversations and making progress.
26/10/23, 9:02 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In consideration of this, I believe it would be beneficial to *schedule a discussion for tomorrow morning at 08:00 am*. By selecting a specific time, you can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us. This discussion will provide an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and offering guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.
26/10/23, 9:02 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: For me to schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the scheduled time. Alternatively, if the proposed time is not suitable for you, kindly share your availability within the window from 08:00 am to 11:00 am, so we can arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.
27/10/23, 12:26 pm - +263 77 228 2821: That would be very kind of you to give me a recap.
03/11/23, 1:14 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Kuvimbanashe,

I would like to extend my appreciation for your patience. I was occupied in a series of meetings with the university officials as we were concluding the admissions for the month of October. Unfortunately, this kept me from being available to connect with you.
03/11/23, 1:18 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I trust that you and your family are in good health, I was able to review your previous message and to help you understand how one's scholarship has been evaluated. Let me help you with a better view -

As you are aware you are yet to get your A Level results, the evaluation of your application has been based on your previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, you are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
03/11/23, 1:18 am - Vilsha Edoofa: To pursue your Bachelor's degree and maintain your scholarship, you need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that you a student should not be qualified for a 50% scholarship. <This message was edited>
03/11/23, 1:19 am - Vilsha Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that if you reserve your scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, your scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that you continue your scholarship opportunity despite your low academic performance in high school.
03/11/23, 1:19 am - Vilsha Edoofa: In case you end up achieving a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate your application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of your scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives you an edge?
03/11/23, 5:32 am - +263 77 228 2821: Noted with thanks. Good morning.
03/11/23, 5:33 am - +263 77 228 2821: I have been able to get in touch with Mr Rajan. We will be able to make part of our registration fee tomorrow Saturday.
04/11/23, 9:35 am - +263 77 228 2821: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 7:43 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kuvimbanashe

I hope you are doing well and we find you in the best of spirits. Thank you for sharing the payment receipt for your first part of the university's remaining registration fee. It has been duly noted with us and we have shared it with the accounts team as well for payment confirmation. 

Once the payment is confirmed by the accounts team and the amount has been reflected in India, we will notify you and the university officials accordingly.
06/11/23, 9:14 am - +263 77 228 2821: Thank you
14/11/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Kuvimbanashe,

I trust that you and your family are doing well today. It is nice to connect with you again, I am Mr. Shivjeet, your admission officer at Edoofa. I am pleased to inform you that the payment for the first part of the university registration fee has been confirmed by the accounts team, and we have also updated the university officials accordingly. <This message was edited>
14/11/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To assist you further and provide clarity on the breakdown of your university registration fee, we have requested the accounts team to provide a summary. We have made every effort to obtain this information, and we are now ready to share it with you. Please find the details below, and kindly review them. If you come across any discrepancies or have any questions, do not hesitate to reach out. However, if everything appears to be in order, please confirm that you have received and acknowledged the provided information.
14/11/23, 8:52 pm - +263 77 228 2821: We are happy to hear that.
14/11/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Name of Student:* Kuvimbanashe Angel Nhende
*University Name:* Galgotias University

*Registration Fee Due:* $750
*Endowment Grant:* $150
*Fee to be paid by the student/parent:* $750 - $150 = $600

*Payment Mode Used:* Cash Payment to Mr. Rajan
*International Transfer Charges:* $42 (07% of the amount to be paid by the student/parent)

*Total amount to be deposited including Charges:* $600 + $42 = $642

*Amount paid for the due registration fee:* $201 (Paid on 4th November 2023)

*Balance Amount Due:* $642 - $201 = $441

As per the payment plan shared by the university, the remaining balance of $441 is to be paid on or before the due date of 30th November 2023. It's worth noting that the earlier you make this payment, the sooner you'll be able to complete your university admission process.
19/11/23, 2:43 pm - +263 77 238 0731: Greetings. According to our records, we paid $14 of the payment charges. The $201 is net of charges making our balance due on registration to be $427 not $441. Kindly check and confirm.
20/11/23, 6:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Kuvimbanashe!

That is absolutely correct, please excuse me for the error in the calculation.
20/11/23, 6:58 pm - +263 77 238 0731: Thank you
27/11/23, 3:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Kuvimbanashe!

I hope you're doing well and shaking off those Monday blues as we step into a fresh new week. I would like to give you a gentle reminder that the day after tomorrow marks the deadline for the second part of your university registration fees. With that in mind, could you please update me on your current preparations regarding the payment for the second part of the registration fees?

This information will be helpful for me to update the university officials. Once provided, they'll anticipate the arrival of your next payment accordingly.
27/11/23, 3:50 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Good afternoon. We are looking into it.
27/11/23, 6:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are facing any challenges?
27/11/23, 6:35 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Yes, the money is not yet enough... Trying to see if we can raise the balance by the 30th or 1st of December.
27/11/23, 9:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online today with the session I was not available further to attend to your concern. Ans I am happy to assist you tomorrow. As my available hours are coming to an end it was a long day for me. Let's reconnect tomorrow from 1:00 PM onwards and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
28/11/23, 4:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Kuvimbanashe. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

Thank you for keeping me updated on your progress regarding the second part of the registration fees.

I understand the challenges you're currently facing with the balance. Your effort to arrange for the remaining amount by the 30th or 1st of December is duly noted. Please be assured that we are here to assist you through this process.

Hence, I wanted to reach out to you and understand the amount you've managed to set aside for your admission fee by the upcoming date of 30th of November after this the university would be closing the round of appliction for this month. This detailed information will empower us to tailor our assistance in the most effective and personalized manner possible with the university officials and they would agree on the same.
28/11/23, 4:53 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Good day. Will try to raise the 427 by the 1st of December. Right now I have got 200 ready.
28/11/23, 5:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your prompt update. I genuinely appreciate your efforts to arrange the funds. Your commitment to meeting the remaining balance by the 1st of December is noted and will be communicated to the university officials. I also want to convey that it's completely acceptable if you are able to provide $200 this month and the rest in the next month. This arrangement will help the university understand your current situation.
28/11/23, 5:02 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Thank you very much for that. Will definitely try to boost it to at least  300 or 350
28/11/23, 9:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. In that case I shall convey the university officials about this update tomorrow that that shall be recieving at least $300 by the end o this month which is 30th of November.
30/11/23, 12:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Kuvimbanashe. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

I wanted to reach out with regard to our previous conversation as you were to make a deposit of the 2nd part of Kuvimbanashe's registration fee today so I would like to know how is your preparation going and if you have any updates to share with us? <This message was edited>
30/11/23, 1:12 pm - +263 77 228 2821: Good afternoon. We have managed to clear the balance of 427 this afternoon. We will share the proof of payment shortly.
30/11/23, 1:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. I shall wait for the receipt eagerly.
30/11/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 238 0731: <Media omitted>

14/12/23, 7:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kuvimbanashe,

I trust that you and your family are doing well today. I am Ms. Ashi, the Admission Officer at Edoofa. I am pleased to connect with you today to share some positive updates with you.

Firstly, I am delighted to inform you that the payment you have made for the university registration fee has been confirmed by the accounts team, and we have also updated the university officials accordingly in order to ensure a seamless transition in your application process. <This message was edited>
14/12/23, 7:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In light of your admission process, I would like to share some exciting news with you regarding your admission process with the university. One of our partnered universities, Lovely Professional University (LPU), which is among the top 100 universities in India, has been considering your application for the scholarship opportunity. They have mentioned that they would be able to give us an update by the month of January, considering the high volume of applications they have received in the past two months (more than 2000 applications).
14/12/23, 7:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In addition to this, the academic board also mentioned that there are a few more universities willing to put your application in consideration for scholarship opportunities in the month of January. Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter. This approach allows you to have multiple scholarship options, giving you the flexibility to decide on the university for your education in India and then carry out your visa application process the right way.
14/12/23, 7:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this update, I also want to inform you that since we are waiting for updates from the universities, we will be holding our conversation until 20th January and will reconnect around the same time. Until then, we wanted to share these updates with you so that you are well-informed about the process and know what lies ahead. We are thrilled to be a part of this new chapter in your academic journey.
14/12/23, 7:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, now that you are done with your admission process, you are encouraged to channel your energy and focus on your Earn While You Learn (EWYL) journey so that you can maximize the benefits from it. May this period be filled with meaningful learning, personal growth, and amazing opportunities. 

If you are not connected with your EWYL Mentor or if you have any queries/concerns related to your admission journey, please feel free to reach out to us and we will do our best to assist you!
