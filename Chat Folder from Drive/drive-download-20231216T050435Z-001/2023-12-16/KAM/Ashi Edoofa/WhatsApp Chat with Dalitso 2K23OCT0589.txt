If you have watched the videos, please share your understanding and insights with us.
19/10/23, 1:20 pm - +260 97 7577218: Good afternoon,we did watch the videos and from our understanding the first video talks about the well fare of the students and how happy they are about the edoofa program and how they'll need to follow instructions also the identification  of student behavior,their teachability and those with high potential and the students must be open minded and follow instructions.
19/10/23, 1:28 pm - +260 97 7577218: The second video explains how students have been dubbed by scammers and how higher education is too expensive and how Edoofa has come up with strategies by giving scholarships and scholarship credits to students to make it easy for parents to support their child in higher education. It shows the pathway for students to follow step by step to the next level of success.
19/10/23, 1:29 pm - +260 97 7577218: This message was deleted
19/10/23, 1:31 pm - +260 97 7577218: The third video talks about priorities of certain universities and why Edoofa has chosen the top 250 universities from the 30,000 and how students are managing to come up with flying colors.
19/10/23, 1:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @260977577218 , that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
19/10/23, 1:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
19/10/23, 1:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
19/10/23, 1:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
19/10/23, 1:36 pm - +260 97 7577218: The fourth video explains about the new action step which is the Statement Of Purpose (SOP) which gives a unique opportunity to convince the admission board and other schools why they are worthy of the scholarship in their school.
19/10/23, 1:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
19/10/23, 1:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
19/10/23, 1:44 pm - +260 97 7577218: Yes we do agree and it is exactly what has been explained in the videos,however, we wanted to find out when the $500-$750 is supposed to be paid since we are yet to clear the remaining $150 by 16 November?
19/10/23, 1:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I appreciate your proactive approach @260977577218. It's important to emphasize that the $500-$750 payment is not an immediate requirement. The process unfolds in a step-by-step manner to ensure that everything aligns smoothly for you.
19/10/23, 1:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: First and foremost, you will receive an offer letters from the universities. Once you've received these offer letters and had the opportunity to carefully review and select the university that best suits your goals and aspirations, you'll be prompted to make the payment for your registration. This step comes after you've had a chance to make an informed decision about your academic journey.
19/10/23, 2:07 pm - +260 97 7577218: Thank you for the prompt response, what if the universities send their acceptance letter before next year,is there possibility of making payments before August-September cause we are looking at the time frame of these payments may be very close to each other that may end up disadvantaging us.please shed more light.
19/10/23, 2:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @260977577218, Yes the University will share your letter before next year but as your admission is for the session 2024-2025. You will arrive in India in the next year. I hope I am clear.

23/10/23, 2:21 pm - +260 771023019: Nutrition plays a pivotal role in maintaining overall health and well-being. As our understanding of nutrition evolves, it becomes increasingly important to delve into specific areas of research that have significant implications for human health. While there are numerous avenues for investigation within the field of nutrition, there are a few areas that particularly concern me and deserve further inquiry. This essay aims to discuss three key areas of nutrition that require more research to enhance our understanding and improve public health outcomes.

1. Nutritional Effects on Mental Health:
One area of nutrition research that greatly piques my interest is the relationship between diet and mental health. Mounting evidence suggests that the food we consume profoundly impacts our cognitive function, emotional well-being, and the development of mental disorders. Exploring this complex interplay between nutrition and mental health could help identify dietary patterns and specific nutrients that may prevent or alleviate conditions such as depression, anxiety, and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. Pinpointing the role of nutrition in mental health could provide a holistic and less invasive approach to mental healthcare, potentially reducing the reliance on pharmaceutical interventions.

2. Impact of Ultra-Processed Foods:
In recent decades, there has been a significant rise in the consumption of ultra-processed foods, which are typically high in added sugars, unhealthy fats, and artificial additives. These products have been associated with numerous adverse health outcomes, including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms through which ultra-processed foods exert their detrimental effects remain poorly understood. Further research is crucial to elucidate the specific components and processing techniques responsible for their negative impact, leading to improved food labeling, stricter regulations, and the development of healthier alternatives to these popular food choices.

3. Nutritional Interventions for Aging Populations:
With a rapidly aging global population, it is imperative to understand how nutrition can positively influence the process of aging and enhance quality of life in older adults. Age-related conditions such as sarcopenia, osteoporosis, and cognitive decline can be influenced by dietary patterns, nutrient deficiencies, or excesses. Research focused on evaluating dietary interventions, optimal nutrient requirements, and personalized nutritional approaches for elderly individuals could significantly contribute to promoting healthy aging and reducing the burden of chronic diseases in this population.

Conclusion:
Nutrition is a multifaceted field that encompasses numerous areas of interest and concern. Researching specific dimensions within nutrition science can bring about significant advancements in public health, preventive medicine, and individual well-being. The three areas I wish to explore further - the impact of nutrition on mental health, the effects of ultra-processed foods, and nutritional interventions for aging populations - possess immense potential in shaping future dietary guidelines and personalized nutritional approaches. By deepening our understanding of these areas, we can pave the way for evidence-based strategies to improve health outcomes and enhance the quality of life for countless individuals.
23/10/23, 2:22 pm - +260 771023019: I. Iron Deficiency Anemia:
Iron deficiency anemia is one of the most prevalent nutritional diseases affecting children worldwide. It occurs when children do not consume enough iron-rich foods or have difficulties absorbing iron. Common causes include a diet lacking in iron-rich foods such as dark leafy greens, red meat, or iron-fortified cereals. Additionally, poor iron absorption can be the result of intestinal infections or excessive consumption of foods containing compounds that hinder iron absorption, such as calcium-rich beverages.

Correction:
To combat iron deficiency anemia, specific measures can be taken. First, parents should ensure their children have a diet that includes iron-rich foods like lentils, eggs, lean meats, and fortified cereals. Iron-absorption can be enhanced by pairing iron-rich foods with vitamin C sources like citrus fruits. Moreover, avoiding excessive consumption of iron absorption inhibitors, such as tea or certain calcium-rich beverages, can be beneficial. In severe cases, iron supplements may be prescribed under medical supervision.

II. Vitamin D Deficiency Rickets:
Vitamin D deficiency rickets is a nutritional disease affecting bone development in children. It occurs due to inadequate exposure to sunlight, low dietary intake of vitamin D, or difficulties in absorbing this nutrient. Children who have limited sun exposure, use excessive sunscreen, or follow strict vegetarian diets are particularly susceptible.

Correction:
Addressing vitamin D deficiency rickets can be achieved through increasing sun exposure, although ensuring adequate sun protection from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. is critical. Supplementation of vitamin D may be recommended by healthcare professionals, especially for infants or children with limited sun exposure. Encouraging the consumption of vitamin D-rich foods, like fatty fish, eggs, and fortified dairy products, is also crucial to overcome the deficiency.
23/10/23, 2:22 pm - +260 771023019: Micro and macro nutrients are essential components of a balanced diet, each playing a unique role in maintaining optimal health and well-being.

Macro nutrients, as the name implies, are required in larger quantities by the body. They include carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Carbohydrates serve as the main source of energy for the body and are found in grains, fruits, vegetables, and dairy products. Proteins are responsible for building and repairing tissues, and can be found in meat, fish, eggs, legumes, and nuts. Fats play a vital role in hormone production, insulation, and protecting vital organs, and are present in oils, butter, avocados, and nuts. Consuming adequate amounts of macro nutrients is essential for energy production, muscle growth and repair, and overall bodily functions.

On the other hand, micro nutrients are needed in smaller quantities but are equally important. They include vitamins and minerals. Vitamins are organic compounds that play a crucial role in metabolic processes, immune function, and overall health. Examples of vitamins include vitamin A, C, D, E, K, and the B-complex vitamins, which can be obtained from various food sources like fruits, vegetables, dairy products, and meats. Minerals, on the other hand, are inorganic substances required for various bodily functions such as bone health, nerve transmission, and enzyme activities. Examples of minerals include calcium, iron, zinc, magnesium, and potassium, which can be found in foods like dairy products, leafy greens, nuts, and lean meats.

Both micro and macro nutrients are vital for maintaining optimal health. Macro nutrients provide the body with energy, promote growth, and support various bodily functions, while micro nutrients are necessary for cellular function, immunity, and overall health. Consuming a varied and balanced diet that includes an adequate amount of both micro and macro nutrients is essential for optimal health and well-being.
23/10/23, 2:23 pm - +260 771023019: Under-nutrition, malnutrition, and overnutrition are prevalent conditions that burden the healthcare system and have a significant impact on public health. Under-nutrition refers to the inadequate intake of essential nutrients necessary for the proper functioning of the human body. Malnutrition, on the other hand, encompasses both under-nutrition and overnutrition, where there is an imbalance between the intake of nutrients and the body's needs. Overnutrition specifically involves excessive consumption of certain nutrients, leading to health problems like obesity and associated conditions.

The burden on the healthcare system due to these conditions is immense. Under-nutrition can result in stunted growth, weakened immune systems, and developmental delays, especially in children. This not only increases the risk of diseases but also creates long-term consequences such as reduced productivity and increased healthcare costs. Malnutrition, including overnutrition, contributes to various non-communicable diseases like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and certain types of cancers. These conditions require constant medical attention, causing a strain on healthcare resources and finances.

To address this situation, it is crucial to implement a multi-faceted approach at the grass-root level. Firstly, awareness campaigns should be conducted to educate communities about the importance of balanced nutrition and its impact on health. Information dissemination through school programs, public health campaigns, and community outreach should emphasize the significance of a diverse diet, including fruits, vegetables, proteins, and limited amounts of fats and sugars.

Secondly, accessibility to nutritious food must be enhanced. This can be achieved through the promotion of sustainable farming practices, supporting local markets and food cooperatives, and implementing policies that ensure the availability and affordability of nutritious foods. In particular, efforts should be made to provide nutritious meals to vulnerable groups, such as pregnant women, lactating mothers, and young children, through government-supported programs.

Furthermore, education on proper food storage, preparation, and cooking techniques should be provided to individuals and families. Practical knowledge about nutrition can equip individuals to make informed choices and utilize available resources optimally. This can be achieved through community workshops, cooking classes, and nutrition counseling services.

Lastly, collaborations among stakeholders are essential to address this issue comprehensively. Governments, healthcare providers, non-governmental organizations, and community leaders must work together to develop and implement policies that prioritize nutrition and allocate adequate resources to tackle malnutrition effectively. This includes the implementation of food fortification programs, vitamin supplementation strategies, and monitoring systems to track progress.

In conclusion, under-nutrition, malnutrition, and overnutrition pose a considerable burden on the healthcare system. To optimize this situation, efforts should be focused on increasing awareness, promoting accessibility to nutritious food, educating on proper nutrition practices, and fostering collaborations at the grass-root level. By adopting a holistic approach, it is possible to improve public health outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and ensure a healthier future for communities.

25/10/23, 9:12 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Dalitso, Wishing you all a wonderful day!

With regards to our conversation yesterday, I noticed that you left the session in between, and I want to make sure everything is in order for today's session. Also, I would like to know if you are available for the session now?
25/10/23, 9:59 am - +260 97 7155187: Good morning
25/10/23, 10:17 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning @260977155187, May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
25/10/23, 10:18 am - +260 97 7155187: Give me 20 minutes
25/10/23, 10:23 am - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @260977155187
25/10/23, 12:01 pm - +260 97 7155187: Failed to move away from work I will communicate when ready
25/10/23, 1:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @260977155187 Please let us know when you will be able to resume our session.
25/10/23, 4:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Dalitso, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
25/10/23, 4:13 pm - +260 97 7155187: Wow so benefiting!
25/10/23, 4:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
25/10/23, 4:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
25/10/23, 4:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
25/10/23, 4:19 pm - +260 97 7155187: It's very clear thanks
25/10/23, 4:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. *Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

 I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
25/10/23, 4:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
25/10/23, 4:24 pm - +260 97 7155187: Yes it does thank you!
25/10/23, 4:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
25/10/23, 4:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
25/10/23, 4:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 30, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 30, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
25/10/23, 4:29 pm - +260 97 7155187: Not as at now thanks
25/10/23, 4:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
25/10/23, 4:32 pm - +260 97 7155187: Maybe enlighten us please
25/10/23, 4:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
25/10/23, 4:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
25/10/23, 4:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
25/10/23, 4:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
25/10/23, 4:38 pm - +260 97 7155187: Thank you 
So are the A-levels supposed to be written here in Zambia before finally reaching India and if yes then when are they supposed to be written?
25/10/23, 6:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @260977155187. Let me help you in understanding, A levels are 12th grad results.
25/10/23, 6:26 pm - +260 771023019: Alright thank you !
25/10/23, 6:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @260771023019 Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
25/10/23, 6:28 pm - +260 771023019: Yes
25/10/23, 6:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
25/10/23, 6:30 pm - +260 771023019: That is correct
25/10/23, 6:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
25/10/23, 6:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
25/10/23, 6:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, Dalitso will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his exams, and his scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
25/10/23, 6:33 pm - +260 771023019: Yes
25/10/23, 6:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
25/10/23, 6:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?'
25/10/23, 6:44 pm - +260 771023019: Not very clear please are you saying I won’t be able to pursue my bachelors degree based on my results or it’s just an example? 
More clarity please
25/10/23, 6:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It's an example dear.
25/10/23, 6:45 pm - +260 771023019: Oh alright thanks!😁
25/10/23, 6:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome, Now, let us move forward to the last point,
25/10/23, 6:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
25/10/23, 6:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
25/10/23, 6:47 pm - +260 771023019: No questions as at now please
25/10/23, 6:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
25/10/23, 6:50 pm - +260 771023019: Am truly excited and hope to be among the lucky 63
25/10/23, 6:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @260771023019 Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
15/12/23, 2:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
15/12/23, 3:00 pm - +260 771023019: Alright we can begin 
Though there’s an error on the country it’s Zambia not Zimbabwe
15/12/23, 3:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about the error, I have share the same with the team and will give you the update once we received their response.
15/12/23, 3:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.

The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/12/23, 3:13 pm - +260 771023019: Yes we can please
15/12/23, 3:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @260771023019 . Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/12/23, 3:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/12/23, 3:20 pm - +260 771023019: 1. 1800 USD
2. 3 years ( 6 semesters)
3. 300 USD
4. $ 750
15/12/23, 3:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response @260771023019, Please allow me to correct you here as your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship is $900. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/12/23, 3:24 pm - +260 771023019: Yes it does
15/12/23, 3:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
15/12/23, 3:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/12/23, 3:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/12/23, 3:31 pm - +260 771023019: I didn’t quite get the last point please
15/12/23, 3:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me explain to you here that in off-campus accommodation. There are two types of options for you, one is with self cooking facility which will be around $1200 per annum and you will be able to seek guidance from the university officials. 

Other option includes the cost of food and basic living expenses which will be around $800 per annum, this is one of the preferred option by Edoofians as this will help you in exploring more. I hope you understand?
15/12/23, 3:39 pm - +260 771023019: Well understood
15/12/23, 3:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
15/12/23, 3:40 pm - +260 771023019: Yes it’s clear
15/12/23, 3:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
15/12/23, 3:49 pm - +260 771023019: That’s very clear
15/12/23, 3:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
15/12/23, 3:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
15/12/23, 3:55 pm - +260 771023019: So the entire $750 should be in full before the 28th??
15/12/23, 4:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to your query, I want to share that the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/12/23, 4:01 pm - +260 771023019: Yes please
15/12/23, 4:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two instalments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of January 28th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/12/23, 4:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before *December 28th, 2023*

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/12/23, 4:13 pm - +260 771023019: Yes we are
15/12/23, 4:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/12/23, 4:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/12/23, 4:24 pm - +260 771023019: I stay in *Zambia* that’s the same mistake that has been made on my offer letter please!!
15/12/23, 4:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @260771023019  In that case you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Penmal for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
15/12/23, 4:41 pm - +260 771023019: Yes please
15/12/23, 4:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Penmal is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

15/12/23, 5:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @~Dee❤️!. Moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
15/12/23, 5:07 pm - +260 771023019: Isn’t the annum tuition fee $900
15/12/23, 5:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @260771023019 Please go through this fees break up dear, You will be able to understand that your annum tuition fee is $1800
15/12/23, 5:17 pm - +260 771023019: Oh sorry for that 🤦🏾‍♂️
It’s well understood
15/12/23, 5:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: No problem dear, I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
15/12/23, 5:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
15/12/23, 5:25 pm - +260 771023019: Yes I have
15/12/23, 5:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a student. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by your parents/guardians.

This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
15/12/23, 5:31 pm - +260 771023019: Yes it does
15/12/23, 5:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
15/12/23, 5:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
15/12/23, 5:39 pm - +260 771023019: No queries please
15/12/23, 5:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @260771023019, Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
