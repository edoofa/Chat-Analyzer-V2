09/09/23, 9:49 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning, Parents and Patience,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As we had promised that after August 2023, we would proceed with your admission process, I am excited to inform you that we are ready for the commencement of the university application process for your higher studies for the intake of 2024. However, before starting, I would like to know how are you and your family doing and how have you utilized your past few months to plan for Patience's higher education?

It's good to be back on this platform. 

Kindly update us on  the latest status concerning patience Habwiinga 's admission to a University.
04/12/23, 8:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Patience.

I hope you are doing well, it has been a long time since we connected, and before we start may I know how are you and your family doing today?
04/12/23, 8:22 pm - +260 97 4960102: We are doing alright thank you for asking.
How are you
04/12/23, 8:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great and I am glad to hear that you are doing well. I would like to understand how you left the group since we have been wanting to connect with you here since september?
04/12/23, 8:39 pm - +260 96 7808874: My Airtel line which was on WhatsApp was hacked, while patience,s phone was stolen after a break in the house where it was kept while she was in school.
04/12/23, 8:40 pm - +260 96 7808874: You must have noticed strange messages at the time my WhatsApp was hacked.
04/12/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, I understand that completely and I am happy to connect with you again today. Let us start with our discussion from tomorrow, before that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. Grade 12 Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (Grade 12).*

*2. Grade 10 Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)* <This message was edited>
04/12/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For the letter of recommendation, we have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process. Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

*Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

*Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, your subject combination for A Level exams, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

*Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

*Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.

This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. I hope you are clear with this?
05/12/23, 10:12 am - +260 96 7808874: Good morning Kirti

Kindly note that patience just completed her grade 12 exams whose results will only be out in January or February 2024. 

For number 2 and 3 I think I did send her grade 9 results into grade 10 and latest results in term one of grade 12 2023 in our last contact before we postponed to resume in September. For  identity proof I did send her under five card as she is still under age to obtain the national ID until after 11.02.2024 when she will reach the required age to obtain it.

The letter of recommendation we have asked her school administration to send it to us. We will be able to share  here as soon as we receive it and also resend her grade 9 results and Under five card for identity proof.

Thank you. <This message was edited>
05/12/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Patience.

I hope you are doing well. Yes please I am aware of the fact that she just finished her grade 12 exams, and hence we kept an option for the Letter of recommendation and that is alright please you can share the letter of recommendation as soon as the school shares it with you, however, please note that the format of the letter should be the same as I shared above yesterday.
05/12/23, 2:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As for the ID, I understand, in that case, you as a parent can also share your ID.
05/12/23, 2:31 pm - +260 96 7808874: Good afternoon thank you. We are doing well hope you are. We have taken note and will surely do share as soon as they share with us.
05/12/23, 2:33 pm - +260 96 7808874: Alright I will do share mine as well.
05/12/23, 2:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. Yes, please in the meantime let us move ahead with our discussion, so may I know if you are ready to start?
05/12/23, 2:34 pm - +260 96 7808874: Yes we are.
05/12/23, 2:35 pm - +260 96 7808874: Patience will pick it up I will be following the discussion.

I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course she have selected for her higher education is BCom and it's my understanding that she is planning to arrive in India in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?

05/12/23, 2:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 2:49 pm - +260 96 7808874: I do remember myself but patience needs to understand herself fully may be you can briefly take her through the stages.
05/12/23, 3:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is completely alright, I'll be more than happy to help Patience explain the steps briefly. The first step was the message from the founders where they shared the message and emphasized the importance of qualities like open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions in the vision of Edoofa, which is to help Edoofians succeed in their careers and become independent and responsible individuals and how we have carefully selected schools and universities based on specific criteria and also highlighted how we prioritize our students and focus on finding qualified educational institutions rather than profit-driven ones. Additionally, the Statement of Purpose (SOP) was explained as a document for students to express their skills, strengths, achievements, vision, and reasons for seeking admission.
05/12/23, 3:18 pm - +260 97 4960102: Noted thank you.
05/12/23, 3:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, may I know if you have any questions so far?

It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
05/12/23, 3:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch.

05/12/23, 6:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
05/12/23, 6:44 pm - +260 97 4960102: That is very wonderful to hear.
05/12/23, 6:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
05/12/23, 6:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
05/12/23, 6:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
05/12/23, 6:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
05/12/23, 6:54 pm - +260 97 4960102: I have reviewed the benefits.
05/12/23, 6:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
05/12/23, 6:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level, grade 10 and grade 12 results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
05/12/23, 6:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means Patience, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
05/12/23, 7:03 pm - +260 97 4960102: Wow this is very inspiring and very well understood thank you.
05/12/23, 7:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
05/12/23, 7:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
05/12/23, 7:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/12/23, 7:09 pm - +260 97 4960102: Yes it does
05/12/23, 7:10 pm - +260 97 4960102: This is very wonderful as it is helping financely
05/12/23, 7:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $650.
05/12/23, 7:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $650. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/12/23, 7:17 pm - +260 97 4960102: Noted thank you
05/12/23, 7:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
05/12/23, 7:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
05/12/23, 7:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $650, you'll need to make a payment of $325 on or before December 25, 2023. The remaining $325 should be paid by January 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
05/12/23, 7:20 pm - +260 97 4960102: I am following
05/12/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
05/12/23, 7:53 pm - +260 97 4960102: Yes I have
05/12/23, 7:55 pm - +260 97 4960102: May please provide with more information
05/12/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level/ garde 12 results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
05/12/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two CP grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their Grade 12.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
05/12/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
05/12/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
05/12/23, 8:05 pm - +260 97 4960102: Yes I have understood now
05/12/23, 8:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 CP grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a student fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 cp Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
05/12/23, 8:12 pm - +260 97 4960102: Yes
05/12/23, 8:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level/ grade 12 (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
05/12/23, 8:15 pm - +260 97 4960102: Yes that's right
05/12/23, 8:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level/ Grdae 12

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level/ garde 12 exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
05/12/23, 8:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
05/12/23, 8:18 pm - +260 97 4960102: Yes I am
05/12/23, 8:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level/ grade 12 results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself. <This message was edited>
05/12/23, 8:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
05/12/23, 8:55 pm - +260 97 4960102: Yes I am clear
05/12/23, 9:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
05/12/23, 9:09 pm - +260 97 4960102: Noted.
05/12/23, 9:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
05/12/23, 9:21 pm - +260 97 4960102: No I do not
05/12/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your guardian,  I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
05/12/23, 9:25 pm - +260 97 4960102: Yes I am
05/12/23, 9:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to know that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
05/12/23, 9:29 pm - +260 97 4960102: Thank you very much. I will pass your regards to the family.
And thank you for your time
05/12/23, 9:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. It was a pleasure connecting with you.
14/12/23, 10:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
14/12/23, 10:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Patience,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *MVN University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
14/12/23, 10:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly.

14/12/23, 10:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 10:57 pm - +260 96 7808874: Thank you. This is exciting news to receive.
14/12/23, 11:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed, I am happy to hear that you are excited and have acknowledged the message, looking forward to connecting with you tomorrow at 06:00 pm CAT. Have a blessed night ahead.
14/12/23, 11:12 pm - +260 96 7808874: Same to you.
15/12/23, 6:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Patience,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
15/12/23, 6:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
15/12/23, 6:12 pm - +260 97 4960102: Good evening thank you.
We are ready for the discussion
15/12/23, 6:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
15/12/23, 6:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/12/23, 6:18 pm - +260 97 4960102: Yes it does.
15/12/23, 6:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/12/23, 6:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
15/12/23, 6:31 pm - +260 97 4960102: 1. $0
2.$0
3. $1250
4. $125
5. $1000
15/12/23, 6:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 100% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout the course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
15/12/23, 6:37 pm - +260 97 4960102: Yes it is
15/12/23, 6:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $0
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
15/12/23, 6:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1250.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1250 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1500.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1250. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
15/12/23, 6:41 pm - +260 97 4960102: Yes it does thank you.
15/12/23, 6:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
15/12/23, 6:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make your education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
15/12/23, 6:44 pm - +260 97 4960102: I have gone through the message please.
15/12/23, 6:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1500, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
15/12/23, 6:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
15/12/23, 6:49 pm - +260 97 4960102: Yes it is
15/12/23, 6:57 pm - +260 97 4960102: Understood
15/12/23, 7:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
15/12/23, 7:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his/her annual fee, which is $1250. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1250 - $1000 = $250, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
15/12/23, 7:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
15/12/23, 7:07 pm - +260 97 4960102: Yes it does
15/12/23, 7:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
15/12/23, 7:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1500 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $900 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
15/12/23, 7:13 pm - +260 97 4960102: It is clear thank you.
15/12/23, 7:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that your financial preparations are in place. I hope you recall that the per annum cost of education and the registration fee figures you mentioned were supposed to face a range of $1200 to $1500 for the annual cost of education and a registration fee between $500 and $750.
15/12/23, 7:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, based on the discussions we had with your career counselor and their assessment of your application, they encouraged us to secure a higher quantum of scholarship for you. This is the reason the per annum cost of education is only $1250, which is significantly less than the general cost of education fee range ($1200 to $1500).
15/12/23, 7:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: When you look at this opportunity, with a higher quantum of scholarship, the registration fee may also appear a bit higher. Rest assured, this does not increase your financial burden, as it is an integral part of your first year of education cost and will be utilized for the same purpose. I hope this makes sense?
15/12/23, 7:17 pm - +260 97 4960102: It does
15/12/23, 7:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In continuation of our discussion, I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for Patience is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that you will find a more affordable and high-quality education. 

Certainly, there are other universities that may assess your scholarship qualifications, and with those, the cost of education may fall within the specified range I mentioned earlier.
15/12/23, 7:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $900 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?
15/12/23, 7:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's essential to consider the big picture and the overall financial benefits that come with the scholarship offer you have received. Do you not agree with this?
15/12/23, 7:21 pm - +260 97 4960102: Yes I do
15/12/23, 7:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to see we share the same perspective. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1,500. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you arrive in India will be $1,500 - $1,000 = $500 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival in India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
15/12/23, 7:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
15/12/23, 7:25 pm - +260 97 4960102: I am clear .
15/12/23, 7:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as December 29th, 2023*.
15/12/23, 7:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/12/23, 7:31 pm - +260 97 4960102: Yes please
15/12/23, 7:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $900 of the registration fee. This $900 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $450 before the first deadline date of *December 29th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $450 before the second deadline date of *January 29th 2024, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/12/23, 7:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $900 within 15 working days, before December 29th, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/12/23, 7:46 pm - +260 97 4960102: Yes we are
15/12/23, 7:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, coming to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zambia, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account
15/12/23, 7:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, most of the students from Zambia prefer to process the payment through our associate Mr. Hammond (Penmal Connect) since it is more convenient and the transfer charges are only 5% of the amount you want to send. 

May I know if you would be able to use the same mode to process the payment of your registration fee as well?
15/12/23, 8:28 pm - +260 96 7808874: Yes we will use the same.
15/12/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, kindly do the same. If you and your parents wish to use the same mode of payment as before, you can do that as well. Let me reshare the account details with you once -
15/12/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Account Name* - Penmal Connect Limited
*Account Number* - 0222030000591
*Name of Bank* - Indo Zambia Bank
