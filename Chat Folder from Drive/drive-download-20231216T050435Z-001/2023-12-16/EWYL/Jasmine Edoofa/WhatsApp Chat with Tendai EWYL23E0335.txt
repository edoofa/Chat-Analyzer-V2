31/07/23, 2:41 pm - +263 77 689 7876: I need to reach out to local schools in my region . First l need to create a list of all higher secondary school, starting with my school and connect with the principal to introduce them to the program. This could be through a phone call or WhatsApp and share why l joined Edoofa and how l have planned my future and share details of the program. I then ask if they are interested in setting up a meeting with the Edoofa program director to explore potential collaboration. I will share contact details with my mentor , which is you
31/07/23, 2:49 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Waiting for this message
31/07/23, 2:49 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Waiting for this message
31/07/23, 3:28 pm - +263 77 689 7876: I understood
31/07/23, 3:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: After the school authorities respond to your message and you set up our meeting with them, you can ask them to fill up the form that will be shared by me in a while. Once you get that information, you can send me the school details via this form.
01/08/23, 1:41 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
01/08/23, 1:43 pm - +263 77 689 7876: 1. St Columbus High. It is already connected with Edoofa
01/08/23, 1:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good, What about Point 2 and 3
01/08/23, 1:46 pm - +263 77 689 7876: 2. Greetings Mr/Mrs ........, l am Tendai Masuku a fellow edoofian and l would like to share with you details about the Edoofa Scholarship program. If you are interested when lm done ,l will connect you with the Edoofa team and my mentor. I look forward to your response and an amazing fruitfull discussion with you . Stay blessed
01/08/23, 1:46 pm - +263 77 689 7876: 3. Manicaland
01/08/23, 1:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
01/08/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 689 7876: Yes I agree with you
01/08/23, 1:55 pm - +263 77 689 7876: Yes
01/08/23, 2:00 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.

Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
01/08/23, 2:04 pm - +263 77 689 7876: Okay
01/08/23, 2:09 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
01/08/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 689 7876: Yes lm ready
01/08/23, 2:14 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_

Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 10:28 am - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, there will be *you will get your Wednesday Lesson today*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
