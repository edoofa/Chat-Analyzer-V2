Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for now. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.
In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄

08/08/23, 3:00 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
08/08/23, 3:04 pm - +263 78 574 3922: Yes I do
08/08/23, 3:05 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
08/08/23, 3:07 pm - +263 78 574 3922: Can I also give you the contact  of my school  deputy  headmaster
08/08/23, 3:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: No dear. You can keep the number to yourself for now and once I will be done explaining you the project then you can share the form with me.
08/08/23, 3:09 pm - +263 78 574 3922: Understood
08/08/23, 3:10 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
08/08/23, 3:11 pm - +263 78 574 3922: Yes iam ready
08/08/23, 3:15 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_
08/08/23, 3:15 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Dear Mr./Mrs. [School Head's Name],
I hope you are in good health and high spirits.
I am writing to you as a proud beneficiary of the esteemed _Edoofa Scholarship Program_ and I feel privileged to have the opportunity to connect with you today.

I am thrilled to share with you that I have been selected to pursue my higher education in India through the Edoofa Scholarship Program. This incredible opportunity allows me to fulfill my dream of receiving a quality education at an affordable price. Not only will I gain knowledge in my chosen field of study, but I will also acquire valuable skills that will set me apart in today's competitive world and increase my employability.
*I firmly believe that students at your esteemed institution should also have access to such life-changing opportunities. Together, we can empower our students to realize their dreams and equip them with the tools needed for a successful and fulfilling future*
May I know at what time you will be available to connect via Whatsapp?
08/08/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 574 3922: Okay
08/08/23, 3:19 pm - +263 78 574 3922: I have send the message
08/08/23, 3:24 pm - +263 78 574 3922: He said we can connect with him anytime via WhatsApp
08/08/23, 3:29 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: That is great, Now it is time to wrap up. *I will see you tomorrow at 1:30 pm.* So Kindly be on time.

3. How did you get to know about the school and what did you discuss with the contact person?
 I interviewed  the  Mr Gava the school deputy headmaster. I discussed  about my future with EDOOFA , its benefits to the school at large for example the teachers as well as the students. We also discussed about how to apply for the program and also the steps to be taken in relation to the program

10/08/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 574 3922: Thank you very much
10/08/23, 2:04 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
10/08/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 574 3922: Okay
10/08/23, 2:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:

1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 10:18 am - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, there will be *you will get your Wednesday Lesson today*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.

14/12/23, 9:26 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, there is an update that I would like to share with you-

Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for now. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.
In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄

15/12/23, 8:30 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now we’re ready to move to the next project! This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Elizabeth!

Yoi mentioned that project 2 of community building involes building a common ernvironment in which people will be working together towards a common goal . It also involves strengthening one's networking skills through social media platforms such as instagram, facebook and linkedin. Most important one must connect with students who had finished their secondary year or those who are in their final secondary years.
After all this one will be receiving scholarship credita if he/ she had managed to connect with several students   , motivates them and ensures that they pay their enrollment fees
