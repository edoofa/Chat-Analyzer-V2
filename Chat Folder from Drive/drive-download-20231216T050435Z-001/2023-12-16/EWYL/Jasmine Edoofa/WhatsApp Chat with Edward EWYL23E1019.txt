15/12/23, 1:53 pm - +263 71 303 5080: 2.Rights and duties are two important concepts that often go hand in hand. Let's start by understanding each of them individually:

1. Rights: Rights are inherent entitlements or privileges that individuals possess by virtue of their existence as human beings, citizens, or members of a particular society. They represent the freedoms and protections that individuals possess, primarily to ensure their well-being, dignity, and autonomy. These rights are often enshrined in laws, constitutions, or international treaties. Examples of rights include the right to life, liberty, and security, freedom of speech, religion, and association, right to a fair trial, and the right to education, among others.

2. Duties: Duties, on the other hand, refer to the responsibilities and obligations individuals have towards society, the government, or their fellow citizens. These duties are often derived from rights and are necessary to maintain social order, harmony, and the functioning of a civil society. Duties can be legally binding or morally expected. They are typically outlined in laws, regulations, or social norms and may include obligations to pay taxes, serve on a jury, adhere to laws, respect the rights of others, and fulfill contractual agreements, among others.

Now, let's discuss the difference between human rights and civil rights:
