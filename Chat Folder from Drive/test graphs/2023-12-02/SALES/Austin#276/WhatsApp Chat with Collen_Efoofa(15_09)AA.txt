15/09/23, 9:49 am - Arshita: Greetings Mr. Anthony, Mrs. Lotalice and Mrs. Maheire! 

I am Ms Arshita, Career Counselor at Edoofa and with us, we have Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions at Edoofa

We have received the application of Collen for the Edoofa scholarship program and I will be taking you all forward through the counselling session to discuss and evaluate your application. Let me know once you are available!
15/09/23, 9:49 am - Arshita: Collen, It is good to see that you have taken the time to learn about the program and fill out the application form to apply. Can you please tell me: 

1)  *What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?*

2) *What are your understandings of the program as per your discussions with Caroline?*
15/09/23, 10:01 am - +263 71 672 9621: 1) From my research on your institution I was intrigued by the good results, up to date technology and facilities
2)With Caroline we didn't  discuss more .But all she said is that the program is there to assist learners to achieve their goals.
15/09/23, 10:02 am - Arshita: Good to know about your understanding of the program.
15/09/23, 10:02 am - Arshita: Let me elaborate you about the program
15/09/23, 10:02 am - Arshita: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
15/09/23, 10:02 am - Arshita: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 
Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 


The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
15/09/23, 10:02 am - Arshita: *I hope you are looking forward to such an opportunity, aren't you?*
15/09/23, 10:06 am - +263 71 672 9621: Yes I am.
15/09/23, 10:07 am - Arshita: Good to hear that!
15/09/23, 10:07 am - Arshita: Now being your counsellor I  would like to give you the opportunity to express more about yourself. Please include your educational qualifications, career aspirations, the province that you live in, hobbies & interests, your family, which professions your parents/guardians are into and more in detail.
You can also add anything more that you would like to share.
15/09/23, 10:22 am - +263 71 672 9621: Firstly my full name is Collen Rugaramwando.I was born in Mashonaland West Province (Magunje in Hurungwe District) ,Zimbabwe. My father Clemence Rugaramwando died when I was 5 years old leaving me and my 3 little sisters.Life was a bit tough from this time upto now as my mother was jobless.Father left us with nothing even a cent..Then my aunt took me to a small town where I studed from form one upto form 4.
Grade 7 results:10 units 
Form 4: 8 subjecte ,2As,5Bs and one D.Since I was born I wanted to be a lawyer but with time as I know the real job of a lawyer I quit and started concentrating on Engineering.When I passed form 4 I was given a chance to proceed to A level in Midlands Province (Gweru),Zimbabwe . I'm a soccer player number 11.Last year we qualified to the national as one of the best teams in our country.
15/09/23, 3:26 pm - Arshita: So after going through the facts that make Edoofa different,
Let me know which point out of the 4 you like the most.
15/09/23, 3:31 pm - +263 71 672 9621: 4 because everything is provided
15/09/23, 3:33 pm - Arshita: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education and guidance.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

15/09/23, 3:37 pm - +263 71 672 9621: Yes I see it's a good program so to earn more you should do many projects
15/09/23, 3:38 pm - Arshita: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
However, may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
15/09/23, 3:39 pm - +263 71 672 9621: The whole family is in part of this program
15/09/23, 3:39 pm - Arshita: That's completely understandable,

So I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.
So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
15/09/23, 3:41 pm - +263 71 672 9621: Happiness will be in there minds as it is there best wish
15/09/23, 3:42 pm - Arshita: Good to hear that!
15/09/23, 3:42 pm - Arshita: studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
15/09/23, 3:42 pm - Arshita: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be

*1) Application Form*

*2) Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

*3) Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
15/09/23, 3:46 pm - +263 71 672 9621: Happiness will be in their minds as it is their best wish.All they want is to see me succeeding
15/09/23, 3:47 pm - Arshita: Have you gone through it
15/09/23, 3:49 pm - +263 71 672 9621: Yes it's true so what I'm supposed to do from know
15/09/23, 3:50 pm - Arshita: Our admissions team will assist you in this.
15/09/23, 3:50 pm - Arshita: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it. 
Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be* somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not*
15/09/23, 3:50 pm - Arshita: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
15/09/23, 3:51 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
15/09/23, 3:51 pm - Arshita: *So shall I sum up, why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
15/09/23, 3:52 pm - +263 71 672 9621: I think the information you provided on the above is quite correct
15/09/23, 3:52 pm - Arshita: Yes, Collen
15/09/23, 3:55 pm - Arshita: Have you gone through it?
15/09/23, 3:56 pm - +263 71 672 9621: Yes ma'am
15/09/23, 3:56 pm - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
15/09/23, 3:56 pm - Arshita: However Collen, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
15/09/23, 3:56 pm - +263 71 672 9621: So what next if I pay the Enrollment fee
15/09/23, 3:57 pm - Arshita: Have you gone through it?
15/09/23, 3:59 pm - +263 71 672 9621: Yes so who will be helping me with the process to find a scholarship
15/09/23, 4:00 pm - Arshita: Our admissions team will assist you in college selection.
15/09/23, 4:00 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
15/09/23, 4:00 pm - +263 71 672 9621: OK ma'am
15/09/23, 4:01 pm - Arshita: Please go through it and answer
15/09/23, 4:02 pm - +263 71 672 9621: I think up to stage 2
15/09/23, 4:02 pm - Arshita: Well Collen
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1:Connect with a counsellor- As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
15/09/23, 4:03 pm - +263 71 672 9621: Yes you can continue ma'am
15/09/23, 4:04 pm - Arshita: *Step 5* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
15/09/23, 4:04 pm - Arshita: This registration fee($500-$750) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
15/09/23, 4:04 pm - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
15/09/23, 4:04 pm - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
15/09/23, 4:06 pm - +263 71 672 9621: Yes ma'am I understand
15/09/23, 4:10 pm - Arshita: Alright , we have come to the end of your counselling session, now before I guide you for Step 2 which is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
*1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*
*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*
15/09/23, 4:10 pm - Arshita: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experience

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
18/09/23, 2:00 pm - +263 71 672 9621: 1.  Quantity Survey 

2. India 

3. $4000-$5000

4.$2000-$3000

5. $500-$750 in 7 days

6. Earn while you learn is a program that was put to help students to finance their school fees themselves instead on relying too much on their parents .Students are provided by work opportunities while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help them in reducing their fees.It is also there to help students to learn and boost their work experiences.

7.Yes sir it's clear
18/09/23, 2:46 pm - +263 77 460 8697: As the family we are on board. We just have to work on raising the pre-requisite fees in time. We are currently working it. I am not quite sure about when the intakes for the Universities happen. Do they have March and August intakes ?
18/09/23, 4:09 pm - Austin#276: Collen, while going through your profile, I noted that you were inclined to law initially, so what were the factors that influenced to quit from this domain?
18/09/23, 4:12 pm - Austin#276: Good to hear from you, Mr. Anthony, 
How are you doing?

Please note that the intake of Collen is in August 2024 but his enrollment will happen now if he qualifies for the Edoofa program. If we begin his eligibility check stage today, it would be of 1-2 days after which the results will be out. So, if Collen qualifies the due date for enrollment will towards the last week of September. Are you comfortable with this timeframe?
18/09/23, 4:14 pm - Austin#276: Moreover, after the enrollment, he will have the opportunity to begin with the Earn While You Learn Program while being in Zimbabwe itself thereby reducing the costs and gaining practical experiences under the guidance of our mentorship team
18/09/23, 4:41 pm - +263 71 672 9621: As for me lawyers are not good people because the facts that are given during the court time are mostly lies.I am a God fearing young man so everything that deal with disobedience I don't tolerate
18/09/23, 4:55 pm - Austin#276: I can understand, Collen. At the same time, don't you think venturing to this field can help you make a difference by standing for the rights and being a helping hand for the disadvantaged?
18/09/23, 5:01 pm - +263 71 672 9621: Law sometimes doesn't work like that sometimes you will be helping a victim going against other people's rights destroying other people's lives with lies.All I want is clean money without other people's tears.Imagine defending a rapist the person that was cought red handed but that person will win in the court because of lies.
18/09/23, 5:06 pm - Austin#276: I understand, Collen and I appreciate your willingness to stand up for the truth at the same, you can be decisive about the type of cases you attend to!

But before further discussions, do you still wish a career in law or you would like to opt for quantity surveying itself?
18/09/23, 5:08 pm - +263 71 672 9621: Quantity Survey itself.

18/09/23, 5:37 pm - Austin#276: This is well noted, is there anything you would like to ask me as of now regarding the program or further proceedings?
18/09/23, 5:43 pm - +263 77 460 8697: Everything seems clear for now, I will follow your lead.

I hope you are doing well
21/09/23, 8:39 pm - +263 77 460 8697: Collen was interested in either Architecture or Quantity Surveying but I notice he has been given the B.A Geography option. He tells me this was discussed and  he was assired that   B.A Geography would lead to him attaining a degree in Surveying, please can you confirm this to be true.
21/09/23, 8:39 pm - Austin#276: @263716729621, Since you have asked for another contact of our beneficiary, let me share a contact from your province itself. 

*Mr Herbert Njini, the former Headmaster of Flecther High School, Gweru and is currently a Lecturer at Midlands State University. Fletcher High is one of our associate schools in Zimbabwe with many Edoofians. Mr Njini's daughter qualified and enrolled in the Edoofa program last week.*
21/09/23, 8:40 pm - Austin#276: Mr STEPHEN NJINI.vcf (file attached)
21/09/23, 8:41 pm - Austin#276: You can connect and meet him in person as students have arrived here in India while he was the Headmaster of Fletcher
21/09/23, 8:48 pm - Austin#276: Please note that in order to study Civil Engineering or Architecture in India, a student needs to have Physics and Mathematics mandatorily in A level due to which Collen wasn't directly eligible for these courses after which the interest in Quantity Surveying was taken into consideration.

Here are a few ways in which quantity surveying and geography intersect:

Location Analysis: Geography plays a crucial role in location analysis for construction projects. Quantity surveyors need to consider factors like geographical location, topography, climate, and local regulations when estimating costs and planning projects. Geographic information systems (GIS) are often used to analyze spatial data relevant to construction.

Environmental Impact Assessment: Geography is important when assessing the environmental impact of construction projects. Quantity surveyors may work with environmental consultants and geographic data to understand the potential effects of construction on the natural environment.

Land Use Planning: Geographical knowledge is essential for understanding land use patterns and zoning regulations, which can influence the feasibility and cost of construction projects. Quantity surveyors may need to navigate complex land use regulations in their work.

Infrastructure Development: Geography influences the design and construction of infrastructure projects such as roads, bridges, and utilities. Quantity surveyors working on infrastructure projects must consider geographic factors like terrain, water bodies, and population distribution.

Market Analysis: Quantity surveyors may analyze geographic regions to assess market conditions for real estate development. Understanding the geography of an area can help in predicting demand and pricing for properties.

Transportation and Logistics: Geographic considerations are crucial when estimating costs for transportation and logistics in construction. The distance between suppliers, construction sites, and end-users can impact project costs.

International Projects: In international construction projects, understanding geography and cultural differences is essential. Quantity surveyors working on global projects must consider geographic factors when adapting cost estimates and project plans to different regions.

The connection between the two fields arises when geography informs the context in which construction projects take place. Quantity surveyors often collaborate with professionals in various disciplines, including geography, to ensure that construction projects are both economically viable and environmentally responsible in their geographic context.
21/09/23, 8:57 pm - Austin#276: At Edoofa, we ensure our students are guided with the best possible opportunities for which they are eligible for. Therefore, we have been weighing the options for Collen and he is also eligible for *Bachelor of Planning(BPlan) as well as Bachelor Design programs*

21/09/23, 9:28 pm - +263 77 460 8697: Ok we note the other  options that you've just posted. So I was saying to Collen maybe what we should have done was to seek advice and guidance from you as far as the Degree programs are concerned of course taking into account his A Level combination of subjects. With his Maths, Technical Graphics and Geography what are his options? Please bear with me , I am trying to figure out the best path for him to take with your help of course , now that he can't do  Architecture or Quantity Surveying  which were his first preferred programs.
21/09/23, 9:40 pm - Austin#276: I do understand, Mr. Anthony!
