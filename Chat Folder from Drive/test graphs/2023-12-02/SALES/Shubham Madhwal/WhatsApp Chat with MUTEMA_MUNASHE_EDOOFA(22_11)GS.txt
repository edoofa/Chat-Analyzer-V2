24/11/23, 11:35 am - +263 77 459 4818: I have leant that edoofa is an institution that gives everyone the opportunity opportunity to study any course of choice using the former school or present results. 
Also it provides an opportunity to work in India after completing the study
24/11/23, 11:44 am - +263 77 459 4818: I am also looking forward for a positive a consideration of my application.
24/11/23, 12:13 pm - Sagar: I see you are well informed, Munashe.
24/11/23, 12:13 pm - Sagar: Now let me brief you about the program.
24/11/23, 12:13 pm - Sagar: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
24/11/23, 12:13 pm - Sagar: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
24/11/23, 12:14 pm - Sagar: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
24/11/23, 12:14 pm - Sagar: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
24/11/23, 2:44 pm - +263 77 459 4818: Yes it is, and I'm looking forward to a great opportunity to study and turn it into reality with help from the institution
24/11/23, 2:47 pm - Sagar: Okay so Munashe, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
24/11/23, 2:47 pm - Sagar: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
24/11/23, 2:47 pm - Sagar: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
24/11/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 459 4818: It is my wish to also reach there and I will try my best to make it possible
24/11/23, 2:54 pm - +263 77 459 4818: Due to some reasons that are beyond my control I can't say I have what it takes to meet the metrics but will try my best
24/11/23, 2:57 pm - Sagar: Duly noted.
24/11/23, 2:57 pm - Sagar: Alright so Munashe, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*

Both of my parents were responsible for paying my fees. My mother is doing social work in the United Kingdom and my father is a civil servant who works in the government of Zimbabwe

25/11/23, 12:25 pm - +263 77 459 4818: Good morning sir.

28/11/23, 8:40 am - Sagar: Good Morning, Everyone!

*"Believe you can and you're halfway there."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
28/11/23, 8:55 am - +263 77 459 4818: Good morning Mr Gurvinder. How are you. We are following...
28/11/23, 8:57 am - +263 77 459 4818: Thank you sir for giving an update
28/11/23, 8:59 am - Sagar: Alright, let us continue the session.
28/11/23, 9:03 am - Sagar: Can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
28/11/23, 9:17 am - +263 77 459 4818: India is fast becoming an economic giant. Therefore, studying at a prestigious institution like edoofa can make someone an opinion leader. Also there are high chances of getting better employment opportunities anywhere in the world after after studying at such an institution like yours.
28/11/23, 9:21 am - Sagar: Noted.
28/11/23, 9:22 am - Sagar: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
28/11/23, 9:33 am - +263 77 459 4818: Yes. I am still wondering hw India managed to take out of poverty more than half of its population in the last decade. Zimbabwe is still struggling with economic sanctions imposed on the country by the USA and and the European Union block.
28/11/23, 9:40 am - Sagar: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
28/11/23, 9:40 am - Sagar: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

1. *Robust Education System:* India has 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges offering diverse educational paths.

2. *Renowned Institutions:* Top-rated Indian universities cover a wide array of fields from engineering to journalism.

3. *Quality Education and Research:* India emphasizes practical skills and hands-on research, pushing your learning boundaries.

7. *Affordability and Scholarships:* India offers quality education at a lower cost and provides scholarships to support you.

28/11/23, 10:19 am - Sagar: So now Munashe, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
28/11/23, 10:23 am - +263 77 459 4818: OK. Thank you Sir for giving me the opportunity to talk to you. I would like to know the background of the  Edoofa Scholarship programmes.
28/11/23, 10:27 am - Sagar: Munashe, the Edoofa program was started to give students like you *AFFORDABLE, ACCESSIBLE, EMPLOYABLE* education so that you too can succeed in life and be the leader the world wants.
28/11/23, 10:27 am - Sagar: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
28/11/23, 10:54 am - +263 77 459 4818: We are not aware of the costs
28/11/23, 11:01 am - Sagar: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
28/11/23, 11:01 am - Sagar: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
28/11/23, 11:01 am - Sagar: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
28/11/23, 11:02 am - Sagar: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 11:02 am - Sagar: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
28/11/23, 11:09 am - +263 77 459 4818: Thank you for the information. I am am convinced that Edoofa program are much affordable as compared to other international universities.
28/11/23, 11:12 am - Sagar: In simple words Munashe what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
28/11/23, 11:13 am - +263 77 459 4818: I will love the Earn while you learn program since it can reduce costs. It also helps me to acquire skills which are required by the ever changing job market environment.
28/11/23, 11:14 am - Sagar: That is great.
28/11/23, 11:14 am - Sagar: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
28/11/23, 11:16 am - +263 77 459 4818: Sure. I think that way will make me contribute to my own school fee. Also it helps me to become a responsible person.
28/11/23, 12:01 pm - Sagar: Munashe, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

28/11/23, 12:14 pm - Sagar: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
28/11/23, 12:14 pm - Sagar: *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
28/11/23, 1:32 pm - +263 77 459 4818: I have no doubt that, Edoofian pogroms can turn my dream into reality. I am hopeful of getting positive consideration.
28/11/23, 1:33 pm - +263 77 459 4818: Together we can make a difference in our communities.
28/11/23, 1:34 pm - Sagar: Yes, that is all we want, to provide accessibility to affordable education to students, that will make them employable.
28/11/23, 1:34 pm - Sagar: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

28/11/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 459 4818: The good news is that the evidence is plenty of students who managed to complete their studies through the Earn While You Learn Program. EWYLP can guarantee the successfully accomplishment of my scholarship. Edoofa is my hope.
28/11/23, 2:02 pm - Sagar: In our quest to provide an education that is affordable, accessible and employable, our Founders have been to African Nations multiple times. Recently during their stay in Zimbabwe in June 2023, they gained valuable insights. Inflation has been a real challenge for Zimbabwean families from the last 20 years.

Until a few years ago, cost of tertiary education in Zimbabwe was affordable for majority of families, however with the recent collapse of the Zimbabwean Dollar, a lot of parents shared their experiences, emphasized the financial challenges of pursuing higher education. In today’s time *Tertiary education expenses in Zimbabwe can amount to approximately $2500-$3500 annually. This surely varies from course to course.*

While the cost of education rose by 25% and is within the range of $1200-$1500 per year, the cost of living is notably high. *Even a basic meal of Sadza and curry can cost a student $1 per serving. This means around $1100 is allocated solely for food, with additional essential costs such as internet which costs around $25-$35 a month, accommodation, and transportation pushing the total to $2000-$2500 per year.
28/11/23, 2:02 pm - +263 77 459 4818: I am really looking forward to be part of that prestigious institution.
28/11/23, 2:03 pm - Sagar: Munashe, by now, I hope you have understood that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is not merely a platform for students to gain admission to an internationally recognized university. It offers much more. Among various differentiators, the value provided by Edoofa to a particular student surpasses that offered by any admission agent or consultant.
28/11/23, 2:08 pm - Sagar: Are we still connected?
28/11/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 459 4818: You are very right Mr Gurvinder. Edoofa is not just scholarship program but a platform to become leaders in our own right.
28/11/23, 2:20 pm - Sagar: Alright Munashe, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
28/11/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 459 4818: Correct. My parents were very supportive throughout my primary and secondary education. They are always there for me. To be honest I have very wonderful parents who are also into academics.
28/11/23, 2:23 pm - Sagar: That is great, Munashe.
28/11/23, 2:23 pm - Sagar: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
28/11/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 459 4818: They are also here on this platform. Last time you were talking to my mother. I can safely conclude that we are together in this journey
28/11/23, 2:24 pm - Sagar: That is very good.
28/11/23, 2:24 pm - Sagar: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
28/11/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 459 4818: Yes. I am ready Sir.
28/11/23, 2:26 pm - Sagar: Munashe as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
28/11/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 459 4818: It wl be between the range of $1500 -$ 2250
28/11/23, 2:30 pm - Sagar: Exactly Munashe, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
28/11/23, 2:31 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 459 4818: That is wonderful
28/11/23, 2:32 pm - Sagar: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
28/11/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 459 4818: I am following.
28/11/23, 2:34 pm - Sagar: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
28/11/23, 2:34 pm - Sagar: Munashe basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
28/11/23, 2:35 pm - Sagar: However Munashe, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
28/11/23, 2:37 pm - Sagar: I would like to correct myself.
28/11/23, 2:37 pm - Sagar: Since you have not given A-level exams.
28/11/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 459 4818: I understand.
28/11/23, 2:38 pm - Sagar: You will follow this plan:
28/11/23, 2:38 pm - Sagar: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
28/11/23, 2:38 pm - Sagar: However Munashe, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
28/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 459 4818: Yes. Like I indicated earlier on
28/11/23, 2:39 pm - Sagar: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
28/11/23, 2:41 pm - +263 77 459 4818: No I wl be glad to know all the stages in the cycle
28/11/23, 2:42 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 2:42 pm - Sagar: Alright Munashe, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in your country itself.
28/11/23, 2:42 pm - Sagar: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
28/11/23, 2:47 pm - +263 77 459 4818: I get it. Thank you very much
28/11/23, 2:48 pm - Sagar: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
28/11/23, 2:48 pm - Sagar: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
28/11/23, 2:48 pm - Sagar: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
28/11/23, 2:48 pm - Sagar: So now would you like to ask anything?
28/11/23, 2:50 pm - +263 77 459 4818: I am satisfied with the explanation. It's very clear.
28/11/23, 2:53 pm - Sagar: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
28/11/23, 2:53 pm - Sagar: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
28/11/23, 2:53 pm - Sagar: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

4.If found eligible for the program you will be paying fees ranging from $2000-$3000
5. The enrollment fee for the  Edoofa program is $350 ,it is payable in two phases $200 dollars within 7 days and the remaining $150,within 30 days. 
6.In my understanding,  the Earn While You Learn is an Edoofa  employability  Initiative program in which students are assigned  real time live online projects during which they gain experience  earning scholarship credits based on their performance. During this program, they will not be paid cash  but they will be compensated in form of scholarship credits that will be redeemed to  part of fees for the next semester. The program also help students to acquire skills like Research Content Writing, Digital  Marketing, Creative Content  Creation, Social  Media  Engagement  and Media Literacy to mention a few. EWYL programme is recognised as  the backbone of the Edoofa  program and it differentiate it from other  programs. That is  how I understand the program. 
7.On the issue of the registration fee paid when receiving an offer letter from the University in India,this will be the last stage of selection and scholarship seat reservation  , I appreciate the explanation given that  this fee will be regarded as part of  the  first year fees.  There is no question about that  everything is clear.

01/12/23, 1:16 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great so Munashe, After understanding your interests and motivation
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:
*This would be contingent on Munashe appears and clears for A-level next year*

*Bachelor of Journalism and Mass Communications (B.J.M.C)*
01/12/23, 1:49 pm - +263 78 307 6096: Indeed it is a good course and I'm also sure that it will cater for my likings . However due to the situation at hand I was no longer intending to go for A level .This is why I chose to pursue this scholarship opportunity so that I would be able to further my studies. My parents are no longer in a position to balance their schedules and securing me a place for A level.Also due to the residential permits of  the Uk that my parents hold  they will have to leave me alone in Zimbabwe  doing A level which is more difficult.Also as a result of the economy in Zimbabwe it might become more difficult for them to pay for my studies after A level if I intend to go for tertiary education.This is the reason why I chose Edoofa to assist me so that it becomes easier for both my parents and I .
