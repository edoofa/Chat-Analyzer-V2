30/09/23, 10:21 am - +263 71 534 7117: My name is Willard Tinashe Nyatsanza,am a boy aged 18 years old from Zimbabwe in the city of kings and queens Bulawayo.

I am a confident young man very composed in everything am assigned to,very passionate about everything i do and have the ability to be a team player and my number 1 strength is i am a very sociable person,i can socialise with whoever ,however therefore i have some weaknesses which are impatience and self criticism which I've struggled with but have managed to work on them,i believe am better now and am still working on my self to be better as an individual.I go to the gym every day as a boy who values his health and am a very good soccer player,have played for the first team in high school and have managed to play for a club in my city,these are just but a few of my hobbies.

I come from a very humble background  blessed with both my parents to be still alive,have 3 siblings,1 older than me and 2 younger.As we are 4 our parents are having a hard time to accommodate all our academic needs hence am applying for a scholarship to make it easier for them .

O level is my current educational level.I would like to study petroleum and energy/Mechanical engineering because it's always been my dream to study engineering and am hoping to fulfill it. 

My mom is unemployed,so is my dad he recently retired.My parents have been supporting my education with the help of some relatives.I have been at home because no one has been able to financially support my higher education hence am applying for this programme.
My O level fee per term was $300
30/09/23, 10:58 am - Tushti: Thank you for your introduction, Willard. It is a pleasure indeed to know more about you and your family

30/09/23, 11:20 am - Tushti: I see
30/09/23, 11:21 am - Tushti: So may I know what motivates you to study mining engineering?
30/09/23, 11:32 am - +263 71 534 7117: Am from Zimbabwe and we have a large variety of minerals and  Africa at large so i want to get into tge sector and be able to help produce more minerals and be able to improve tge African continent financially
30/09/23, 11:36 am - Tushti: I see
30/09/23, 11:36 am - Tushti: Mining engineering is a field of engineering that is concerned with the extraction and processing of minerals from the earth. It is a field that has been around for centuries and is currently experiencing a resurgence due to the increased demand for materials such as metals, minerals, and oil. However, due to the changing nature of the world’s economy, it is unclear whether mining engineering will remain a viable field of study and profession 10 years down the line. 

One of the primary reasons why mining engineering may not be successful 10 years down the line is the increasing shift towards renewable energy sources. With the world’s reliance on fossil fuels decreasing, there is less need for the materials that mining engineers specialize in extracting and processing. Furthermore, the increasing focus on environmental conservation has also contributed to this shift, as the extraction of minerals and materials can often have a negative impact on the environment. 

In addition, the advancement of technology in other engineering fields such as computer science and mechanical engineering may also lead to the decreased relevance of mining engineering. As technology improves, these other fields are becoming more efficient and effective in the development of new products and services. This increased efficiency and effectiveness can lead to a decrease in the demand for materials that are extracted and processed by mining engineers. 

Finally, the increasing cost of labor may also be a factor in the decreased relevance of mining engineering 10 years down the line. As the cost of labor increases, it becomes more difficult for mining companies to remain profitable. This can lead to mining companies cutting back on labor costs, which can reduce the demand for mining engineers and other professionals in the field. 

In conclusion, mining engineering may not be successful 10 years down the line due to the increasing shift towards renewable energy sources, the advancement of technology in other engineering fields, and the increasing cost of labor. As a result, mining engineers may need to look for other opportunities in order to remain relevant and successful in the future.
30/09/23, 11:38 am - Tushti: For these reasons, Willard, as your your counsellor, I do not recommend this course to you and suggest you study Mechanical engineering instead

30/09/23, 12:46 pm - +263 71 534 7117: Very interesting information i didn't know
30/09/23, 12:46 pm - Tushti: So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
30/09/23, 12:47 pm - +263 71 534 7117: No
30/09/23, 12:48 pm - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
30/09/23, 12:48 pm - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
30/09/23, 12:48 pm - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
30/09/23, 12:49 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
30/09/23, 12:49 pm - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
30/09/23, 12:49 pm - Tushti: In simple words Willard, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
30/09/23, 12:50 pm - +263 71 534 7117: Ok ok following
30/09/23, 12:52 pm - +263 71 534 7117: I will also do the earn while ypu learn programme if i get the scholarship
30/09/23, 12:57 pm - Tushti: Yes
30/09/23, 12:57 pm - Tushti: Willard, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
30/09/23, 12:57 pm - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
30/09/23, 12:57 pm - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

30/09/23, 12:58 pm - Tushti: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
30/09/23, 1:03 pm - +263 71 534 7117: Edoofa is very different indeed
30/09/23, 1:04 pm - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.
30/09/23, 1:05 pm - Tushti: Willard, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
30/09/23, 1:06 pm - +263 71 534 7117: Close $1800
30/09/23, 1:07 pm - Tushti: Exactly Willard, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
30/09/23, 1:07 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
30/09/23, 1:07 pm - Tushti: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
30/09/23, 1:07 pm - Tushti: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
30/09/23, 1:23 pm - Tushti: Do answer dear
30/09/23, 3:10 pm - +263 71 534 7117: I would like and have loved to pay the programme fee 
But am financially unstable at the moment
30/09/23, 3:37 pm - Tushti: I understand, Willard
30/09/23, 3:37 pm - Tushti: Let me share all the details with you and then you may decide whether you wish to proceed further with your application
30/09/23, 3:38 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
30/09/23, 3:38 pm - Tushti: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are required to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
30/09/23, 3:38 pm - Tushti: However Willard, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
30/09/23, 3:38 pm - Tushti: Are you able to understand?
30/09/23, 3:46 pm - Tushti: Do let me know, Willard!
30/09/23, 3:47 pm - +263 71 534 7117: Yessir
30/09/23, 3:48 pm - Tushti: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
30/09/23, 3:48 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
30/09/23, 3:48 pm - Tushti: Alright Willard, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
30/09/23, 3:48 pm - Tushti: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
30/09/23, 3:49 pm - Tushti: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
30/09/23, 3:49 pm - Tushti: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
30/09/23, 3:49 pm - Tushti: With this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, would you like to ask anything?
30/09/23, 3:54 pm - Tushti: Do answer, Willard
30/09/23, 3:56 pm - Tushti: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
30/09/23, 3:56 pm - Tushti: And, for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have. 

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *on Tuesday 3rd October Mr. Shubham* would also be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *I have also shared the Certificate of Incorporation of our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. Do share the same with your parents so that if they would like to confirm anything they could get it confirmed please.*
30/09/23, 3:56 pm - Tushti: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session.
