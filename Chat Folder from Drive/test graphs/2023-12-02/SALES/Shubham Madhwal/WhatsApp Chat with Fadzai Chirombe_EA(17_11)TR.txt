21/11/23, 11:48 am - +263 78 620 7739: Ok
21/11/23, 11:48 am - Tushti: *Diploma ECE* is a 2-year program which can be pursued if a student has cleared 10 with Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics as main subjects. It involves the study of design, analysis, and application of electronics and communication circuits.

21/11/23, 11:53 am - +263 78 620 7739: Ok thank you but l would like to do that l really feel l should do this
21/11/23, 12:01 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 80 to 100 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
21/11/23, 12:14 pm - +263 78 620 7739: One of my biggest career goals in the next 5 years is to dive as deep as possible into full-stack development but also to fill in a leadership position. Additionally, I want to improve my soft skills such as communication, presentation skills, and public speaking. There’s an imbalance between my technical knowledge and the way I organize and verbalize my thoughts. Getting good at interpersonal communication and organization could help me get a leadership position and expand my duties. l would also want to be the best student in Electrical and Electronics engineering because here in Zimbabwe we have a problem of electricity l would like to solve that problem with the knowledge l will be earning with the help of Edoofa
21/11/23, 12:16 pm - Tushti: That is really great Fadzai, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?

21/11/23, 12:27 pm - +263 78 620 7739: The high quality of education will always be my main reason as to why I want to study abroad.
21/11/23, 12:30 pm - +263 78 620 7739: There are many ways in which studying abroad is beneficial for your personal development. You can gain confidence, meet new people also new studying skills ..Like wat l said before here in Zimbabwe we shortage of electricity which results to poor education
21/11/23, 12:37 pm - Tushti: I completely understand
21/11/23, 12:37 pm - Tushti: So now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination

21/11/23, 12:44 pm - +263 78 620 7739: Higher education in India is well known for its affordability which is an extra benefit in addition to its high quality. It is possible to receive a great education at an affordable price
21/11/23, 12:44 pm - Tushti: Very well researched Fadzai. You see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

21/11/23, 12:49 pm - +263 78 620 7739: Thank you
21/11/23, 12:51 pm - Tushti: So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
21/11/23, 12:54 pm - +263 78 620 7739: Without the scholarship we won't afford
21/11/23, 12:55 pm - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
21/11/23, 12:55 pm - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
21/11/23, 12:55 pm - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
21/11/23, 12:56 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 12:56 pm - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
21/11/23, 12:56 pm - Tushti: In simple words Fadzai, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
21/11/23, 12:57 pm - +263 78 620 7739: Ok l understand
21/11/23, 12:58 pm - Tushti: So now if you have no further questions, shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
21/11/23, 12:59 pm - +263 78 620 7739: Yes u can
21/11/23, 1:00 pm - Tushti: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
21/11/23, 1:01 pm - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
21/11/23, 1:01 pm - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

21/11/23, 1:02 pm - Tushti: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

*I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?*
21/11/23, 1:06 pm - +263 78 620 7739: Interesting
21/11/23, 1:07 pm - Tushti: Do you feel the Program would benefit you?
21/11/23, 1:07 pm - +263 78 620 7739: Yes
21/11/23, 1:09 pm - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.
21/11/23, 1:09 pm - Tushti: Fadzai, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
21/11/23, 1:11 pm - +263 78 620 7739: Will end up spending more than $1500
21/11/23, 1:12 pm - Tushti: Exactly Fadzai, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
21/11/23, 1:12 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 1:12 pm - Tushti: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
21/11/23, 1:12 pm - Tushti: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
21/11/23, 1:12 pm - +263 78 620 7739: Can ask ...is there any chances they can not reply my application after paying application fee
21/11/23, 1:14 pm - Tushti: No, dear, that does not happen
21/11/23, 1:15 pm - +263 78 620 7739: Ok thank you
21/11/23, 1:15 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
21/11/23, 1:15 pm - Tushti: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are required to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
21/11/23, 1:15 pm - Tushti: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
21/11/23, 1:15 pm - Tushti: I hope you are able to understand?
21/11/23, 1:15 pm - +263 78 620 7739: Yes l am
21/11/23, 1:17 pm - Tushti: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
21/11/23, 1:17 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 1:17 pm - Tushti: Alright Fadzai, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
21/11/23, 1:17 pm - +263 78 620 7739: Ok
21/11/23, 1:17 pm - Tushti: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
21/11/23, 1:17 pm - Tushti: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
21/11/23, 1:18 pm - Tushti: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
21/11/23, 1:18 pm - Tushti: With this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, would you like to ask anything?
21/11/23, 1:20 pm - +263 78 620 7739: No
21/11/23, 1:21 pm - Tushti: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
21/11/23, 1:21 pm - Tushti: And, for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have. 

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *tomorrow at 12 pm  Mr. Shubham* would also be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application*
21/11/23, 1:22 pm - Tushti: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session. I look forward to seeing your smiling face on such a picture very soon!

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

My inspirational story
Somewhere in life, we sometimes fail and we sometimes get hurt but there’s always someone behind who would aspire us to out shine ourselves in doing enormous things. They are the reason why we stand up again and learn to mend our wounds. They are our inspiration in life, our motivator and our strength to reach success. It has always been a part of our life’s voyage to encounter different challenges in life. In every achievement, frustrations and happiness in my life, mother is always there at my side to guide and prop me up. I am so overwhelm and grateful for I have her as my mother. They are my inspiration in doing magnificent things of my life. Seeing her  suffering while working too hard under the heat of the sun just to give us a good future inspires me. Because of her efforts and warmth love, I am so inspired to study hard and more persevered in achieving all my dreams in life. Having a debt of gratitude to her, I want to pay all her hard works by giving her  a sufficient and marvelous life someday. I am willing to study hard not only for my self but also for my family . Without them i am nothing. My mother been playing Dad's role since the day my father died .I will forever love her and l will make sure one day will make her proud

29/11/23, 8:22 am - +263 78 620 7739: Yes
29/11/23, 8:54 am - Shubham Madhwal: So before we begin with the session are there any questions you would like toask?
29/11/23, 8:55 am - +31 6 85777524: Good morning Shubham

29/11/23, 10:21 am - +31 6 85777524: I am so sorry my transaction  can not
29/11/23, 10:22 am - Shubham Madhwal: So Can Fadzai, complete the formalites here in Zimbabwe?
29/11/23, 10:22 am - +31 6 85777524: Yes she can.
29/11/23, 10:34 am - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted, So shall I share with you the transaction method for the same?
29/11/23, 10:35 am - +31 6 85777524: I think that one to pay to your associate account in Zimbabwe
29/11/23, 11:15 am - Shubham Madhwal: Alright so, if you have gone through your Letter of Acceptance thoroughly, you must have seen, that there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

May I know which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
29/11/23, 11:19 am - +31 6 85777524: 2
29/11/23, 11:19 am - Shubham Madhwal: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $80 to $100 which becomes quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $80 to $100 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr Shorwi's Account.

So as you can see in the letter there is a Bank deposit in, Mr Shorwi Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School's account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe
29/11/23, 11:19 am - Shubham Madhwal: The fee payment can also be made through Hartzell High. School Ex-Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, *the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be 12.5% of the fees you are paying* the same details are as below:-
