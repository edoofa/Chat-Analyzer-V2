03/09/23, 3:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Parents and Senamiso,

As you prepare for your departure and get ready to board your flight from your home country, please take a moment to review the following messages. They contain important instructions for things you need to do before boarding your flight and tasks you'll need to complete upon your arrival in India.

*As per our records, your flight is scheduled to land in India on the 6th of Sep at 01:55 am at the Delhi Airport.*

Please read these instructions carefully and follow each one diligently. They are not only essential for your safety but also crucial to ensuring a smooth journey to India. We have full confidence that you understand the importance of these arrival instructions and will adhere to them accordingly.
03/09/23, 3:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Things to do before departure:*

1. Kindly ensure that all of your luggage is properly labeled with your name and securely locked to guarantee safety during travel.

2. Make sure you get a covid test done and have a negative RT/PCR report with you.

3. Keep at least $150 cash handy with you. The easiest, most reliable way to convert your dollars into Indian rupees and to get the best exchange rate is to do so at the airport. Additionally, make sure to double-check the conversion rate online before exchanging the money.

4. Keep your passport and Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) handy for identification.

5. Before boarding your flight, take a picture of yourself at the airport and share it in your respective admissions group. This will help the team identify you upon your arrival at the airport.

6. Ensure to keep these contact details on a piece of paper and keep it handy: 
 Mr. Rithvik - +91 7696398732
 Ms. Vilsha - +91 81787 23499
 Mr. Mukund- +91 93546 23922
03/09/23, 3:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Post Arrival Instructions*

1. As soon as your flight lands, kindly connect to the wifi. You would need at least one to one and a half hours to check out and collect your baggage. Inside the airport, you will have to buy an Indian sim card which would cost you around $5-$7. Activate the SIM and call the officials whose contact details you have.

2.  Since you are arriving late in the night, once you check out, do not leave the airport. The officials from the Edoofa team will be coming to the airport to receive you at 10:00 am and hence you would have to stay inside the airport for your safety in the morning at 10:00, you will have to check out. In the morning, you can meet the Edoofa officials at KFC, near gate number 6, pillar number 17. I am also sharing the picture of the KFC with you for your reference.

3. When you meet the Edoofa Official, provide them with your full name and ask them to confirm your admission group name. Trust them only if they can verify the code. Rest assured, there will be no instance where the Edoofa Officials fail to receive you. Wait for them at the designated meet-up point and disregard any other individuals claiming otherwise or offering transportation services.

*Your Admission Group Code is: Senamiso 2K22DEC0698*

4. Please do not exit the airport premises until you meet the Edoofa team members. Do not take a taxi or bus from the airport to the university unless instructed to do so by the Edoofa team in person. Taxi drivers may approach you, but ignore them and wait for the Edoofa Official's guidance.

5. For your journey from the airport to the university campus, you will be boarding the university bus. The bus ride takes approximately 5-6 hours to reach the university campus. The Edoofa officials will assist you in boarding the bus. Remember to adjust your watch to be 03 hours 30 Minutes ahead of your time, as that will be the local time in India.
03/09/23, 3:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please take your time to carefully review the above instructions, including the provided pictures of the designated waiting area at the airport. Additionally, make sure to go through the shared Travel Guidelines. Once you have read and understood everything, kindly send an acknowledgment here in the group.

I have a crucial update to share with all of you. As you may be aware, whenever one makes an International money transfer, there is an amount charged by the bank which is usually around 18%. Due to exchange in fluctuation, Ms. Eugene has received the less amount needed for your resrvation. 

In order to cover the difference, a payment of $35 is now required to successfully book your accommodation. For more details and instructions regarding this payment, please reach out to Ms. Eugene directly. She will provide you with all the necessary information.

06/09/23, 1:31 pm - +263 77 349 6426: Afternoon. Thank you very much
10/09/23, 10:49 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Senamiso

I hope this message finds you well. Recently, we had a conversation with the academic board and university officials at Galgotia University, and we received the fee breakdown for your first semester.
10/09/23, 10:50 am - +263 77 724 9633: good day
10/09/23, 10:51 am - +263 77 724 9633: may you share it with us
10/09/23, 10:51 am - Ashi Edoofa: Please take a moment to review the breakdown below and confirm that it is accurate. If you notice any discrepancies, kindly inform us as early as possible so that we can correct them with the university -

Name of Student: Senamiso L Ndlovu
Per semester tuition fee (after scholarship): $900
Per semester exam fee: $100
Total cost of education: $1,000 (tuition fee + exam fee)

It's worth noting that you've already made a registration fee payment of $750 through Edoofa, which has been allocated towards reserving your scholarship seat. Consequently, the remaining balance for your first semester's education is calculated as $1,000  - $750 = $250.
10/09/23, 10:53 am - Ashi Edoofa: In relation to the outstanding first-semester balance fee of $250, we'd like to remind you that this fee is should be settled during the first semester, ideally prior to your arrival in India.

Taking into consideration the payment you made for your registration fee and the amount of $200, which you contributed towards your first-semester fee, the current balance for this semester stands at $250 - $200 = $50.

If the provided fee breakdown is accurate, in that case, we would like to understand the plans you have in place to clear the balance for your first-semester fee. This will enable us to facilitate the payment process accordingly.
10/09/23, 10:56 am - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rithvik, the head of student welfare, will be available at the university to address any inquiries students may have. He will also provide information about the remaining fee balance and guide students through the process of fee deposits. I am sharing Mr. Rithvik number, the Head of the Division of Student Welfare, +91 7696398732 and Mr. Mukund number, an Associate in the same department,+91 93546 23922

Kindly confirm the payment method you intend to use for the $50 fee. 

If you have already brought your fee to India, please confirm here so that we can inform the team, and they will coordinate with you accordingly.

Alternatively, if you plan to deposit the fee from your home country, please inform us, and we will assist you with that process as well.

Please remember the significance of clearing your fee. Until your fee is settled, you won't be able to attend your academic classes. <This message was edited>

I have an important update to share with you that the university officials have successfully concluded the process for setting up bank accounts specifically tailored for our international students. This marks a crucial step towards ensuring a seamless and enriching experience during your tenure at our university.
01/12/23, 10:38 am - +91 93546 23922: In order to open a bank account, all the students are required to visit any nearby branch of the *Punjab and Sind Bank*. To commence this process, it is mandatory for all international students to make a brief visit to the International Relations Office by today, before 4:00 PM. We've discussed the same with the Officials of the International Relations Department at Galgotias University and taken the liberty to prepare Bonafide letters for you since it is a mandatory requirement in opening a bank account with Punjab and Sind Bank.

When you drop by, kindly ensure to bring along a copy of your FRRO Registration Form. This will enable the officials to efficiently compile the necessary paperwork required for you.
