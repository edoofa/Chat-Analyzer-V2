28/11/23, 6:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Clarisy,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
28/11/23, 6:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
28/11/23, 6:15 pm - +263 78 182 0835: it was indeed a happy moment for us as a family
28/11/23, 6:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
28/11/23, 6:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
28/11/23, 6:16 pm - +263 78 182 0835: i wanted to ask which city the university is in
28/11/23, 6:17 pm - +263 78 182 0835: okay thank you very much
28/11/23, 6:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please, do not worry we will be sharing the insights to the university as well at the end of our discussion.
28/11/23, 6:18 pm - +263 78 182 0835: okay
28/11/23, 6:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Gulzar Group of Institutions, rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
28/11/23, 6:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
28/11/23, 7:37 pm - +263 78 182 0835: 1.$1225
2.$1200
3.$750
28/11/23, 7:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly, you are absolutely correct. I would like to provide some additional details regarding your offer letter from the Gulzar Group of Institutes. As you can see, following the scholarship, your annual tuition fee amounts to $1225.

In the first year, it is compulsory for students to select on-campus hostel accommodation, primarily because the university needs to complete their Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) formalities. However, from the second year onwards, students have the flexibility to choose off-campus housing if they prefer, as they would have become more familiar with the area and likely formed connections with their classmates.
28/11/23, 7:44 pm - +263 78 182 0835: Yes i understand
28/11/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Gulzar Group of Institutes places a strong emphasis on student safety as a top priority. To ensure that students have an affordable and comfortable living experience in the hostels, the university has designed its accommodations with the well-being of the students in mind costing $1200. 

The hostel rooms are four-seaters and come equipped with air conditioning. Importantly, the cost of accommodation also covers the expenses for the food/mess service, which includes three meals a day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) for each student.
28/11/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, the university intentionally assigns roommates to students to foster a supportive and communal atmosphere, enabling students to rely on their peers for assistance and companionship. 

This approach enhances the overall living experience and contributes to a sense of security and camaraderie within the student community. I hope you have taken note of this and this clarifies the tuition fee and the accommodation facilities for you?
28/11/23, 7:48 pm - +263 78 182 0835: Yes everything is classified
28/11/23, 7:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In light of this, let us move forward with our discussion. As you are now familiar with your annual fee at Gulzar Group of Institutes, let me outline the various facilities and services covered by the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living/Accommodation Costs
3. Food Costs
4. Library Fee
5. 24-Hour Wifi Access
6. Maintenance Fee
7. Water Bill
8. Electricity Bill

These components collectively make up the comprehensive package that you will receive as part of his university fee, ensuring a well-rounded and hassle-free educational experience. I hope we are together so far and this resonates with you?
28/11/23, 7:56 pm - +263 78 182 0835: yes we are on the same page
28/11/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we have established the tuition fee at $1225 and the accommodation fee at $1200, making his total annual education cost $2425, let me guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. Through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
28/11/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
28/11/23, 7:59 pm - +263 78 182 0835: it is clear
28/11/23, 8:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earn scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
28/11/23, 8:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, he can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his annual fee, which is $2425. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2425 - $1000 = $1425, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
28/11/23, 8:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how [name] can effectively make his education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
28/11/23, 8:01 pm - +263 78 182 0835: yes it clarifies
28/11/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.

Having said that, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter.
28/11/23, 8:10 pm - +263 78 182 0835: okay
28/11/23, 8:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As previously mentioned, the registration fee of $750 is not an additional cost; instead, it's a part of your first-year tuition fee. Therefore, it will be adjusted against the total fee of $2425 for the first year. 

Consequently, the remaining fee that you will be required to pay after [name] arrives in India will be $2425 - $750 = $1675. This amount can be conveniently paid in two installments of $837 and $838, with a six-month gap between them.
28/11/23, 8:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The first installment can be paid either before your arrival in India or within three days of his arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.

I hope this information is clear and we both have a shared understanding of this arrangement?
28/11/23, 8:12 pm - +263 78 182 0835: it is clear
28/11/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 11th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
28/11/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
28/11/23, 8:25 pm - +263 78 182 0835: can it not be payed at a later date
28/11/23, 8:25 pm - +263 78 182 0835: yes please do
28/11/23, 8:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of December 11th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of January 11th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
28/11/23, 8:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before December 11th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
28/11/23, 10:22 pm - +263 78 182 0835: yes its clear
28/11/23, 10:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for being available today. As my available hours are coming to an end it was a long day for me. Let's reconnect tomorrow and continue this session at the same time which is 06:00 pm. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
28/11/23, 10:40 pm - +263 78 182 0835: goodnight
29/11/23, 6:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Clarisy.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation yesterday, since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
29/11/23, 6:52 pm - +263 78 182 0835: yes we are available
29/11/23, 6:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
29/11/23, 6:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
29/11/23, 7:01 pm - +263 78 182 0835: Yes am residing in Harare
29/11/23, 7:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
29/11/23, 7:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
29/11/23, 7:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
29/11/23, 7:20 pm - +263 78 182 0835: okay
29/11/23, 7:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: yes please. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
29/11/23, 7:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
29/11/23, 7:30 pm - +263 78 182 0835: yes do provide the details
29/11/23, 7:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
29/11/23, 7:41 pm - +263 78 182 0835: okay thank you
29/11/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
29/11/23, 8:49 pm - +263 78 182 0835: you can continue
29/11/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, let me share a few insights into the university with you -

29/11/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
29/11/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be tomorrow. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
29/11/23, 8:56 pm - +263 78 182 0835: I wanted to ask if it is possible for me to find another place to live outside of campus
29/11/23, 9:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please you can as it is mentioned above that In the first year, it is compulsory for students to select on-campus hostel accommodation, primarily because the university needs to complete their Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) formalities. However, from the second year onwards, students have the flexibility to choose off-campus housing if they prefer, as they would have become more familiar with the area and likely formed connections with their classmates.
29/11/23, 9:14 pm - +263 78 182 0835: will i be sharing the room i will be sleeping in with someone else
