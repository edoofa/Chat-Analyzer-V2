For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
14/08/23, 8:51 pm - +260 761470673: Yes
14/08/23, 8:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/08/23, 8:55 pm - +260 761470673: I have read.
14/08/23, 8:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
14/08/23, 8:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
14/08/23, 8:59 pm - +260 761470673: Yes please.
14/08/23, 9:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
14/08/23, 9:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
14/08/23, 9:04 pm - +260 761470673: Yes
14/08/23, 9:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
14/08/23, 9:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
14/08/23, 9:10 pm - +260 761470673: Yes
14/08/23, 9:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
14/08/23, 9:11 pm - +260 761470673: Yes please.
14/08/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
14/08/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
14/08/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall share the videos with you now.
14/08/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

14/08/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
14/08/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
14/08/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
14/08/23, 9:25 pm - +260 761470673: Now.
14/08/23, 9:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall wait for your response.
14/08/23, 9:28 pm - +260 761470673: No problem. So can I summarize them tomorrow with a fresh mind.
14/08/23, 10:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Since tomorrow is a National holiday here in India, we will not be able to connect with you tomorrow hence I was waiting for your response so that we could move on to the next step in the admission process.
14/08/23, 10:33 pm - +260 761470673: Alright, just a few minutes.
14/08/23, 10:52 pm - +260 761470673: Video 1; encourages Edoofians to follow instructions and be open minded. 
Video 2; edoofa's vision is to make a huge success. 
Video 3; reasons for approving the best universities, colleges and schools if they are fit enough for international students. 
Video 4; consists of the reasons for studying that particular course and why a student has chosen to study at a certain university
14/08/23, 10:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
14/08/23, 10:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
14/08/23, 10:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
14/08/23, 10:58 pm - +260 761470673: Thank you for that clarity.
14/08/23, 10:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
14/08/23, 11:00 pm - +260 761470673: Yes
14/08/23, 11:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Wednesday at 01.00 pm.
14/08/23, 11:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

16/08/23, 9:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
16/08/23, 9:12 pm - +260 761470673: Yes.
16/08/23, 9:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
16/08/23, 9:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
16/08/23, 9:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
16/08/23, 9:15 pm - +260 761470673: Yes, it not possible.
16/08/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
16/08/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
16/08/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
16/08/23, 9:19 pm - +260 761470673: Yes, he did.
16/08/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $1250-$1500 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
16/08/23, 9:32 pm - +260 761470673: Yes
16/08/23, 9:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
16/08/23, 9:40 pm - +260 761470673: <Media omitted>
16/08/23, 9:41 pm - +260 761470673: To $0
16/08/23, 9:41 pm - +260 761470673: From $500-$750.
16/08/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is completely true the registration fee will be adjusted towards your first year's fee, allow me to explain further.  As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
16/08/23, 9:45 pm - +260 761470673: Yes please.
16/08/23, 9:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
16/08/23, 9:49 pm - +260 761470673: $2050
16/08/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I did not understand you well here, could you please elaborate and help me understand your query better?
16/08/23, 9:55 pm - +260 761470673: Is this $2050 the money that is paid for admission process?
16/08/23, 10:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @260761470673, I think you have misunderstood the statement for the admission process you would are only required to pay the registration fee which is $750 after you get your offer letter from the University to reserve your seat with the university. So now let us assume that your total expense is $2800 (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) so now if you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months after you arrive in India which is in August 2024.

I hope we are clear here?
16/08/23, 10:05 pm - +260 761470673: Yes, now it is clear.
16/08/23, 10:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, now Hasting, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
16/08/23, 10:09 pm - +260 761470673: Alright, thank you.
16/08/23, 10:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, have a great night.
16/08/23, 10:11 pm - +260 761470673: Thank you and same to you.
16/08/23, 10:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome and thank you.

17/10/23, 2:56 pm - +260 761470673: Yes
17/10/23, 2:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Computer Science) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
17/10/23, 2:59 pm - +260 761470673: Yes, it is.
17/10/23, 3:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/10/23, 3:11 pm - +260 761470673: Yes.
17/10/23, 3:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
17/10/23, 3:21 pm - +260 761470673: Admission process is the stage where you are closely going to work on my scholarship application after sharing to the applicable university for my course.
17/10/23, 5:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @260761470673 as I will explain the points in brief you shall understand the benefits better. 

Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
17/10/23, 5:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
17/10/23, 5:02 pm - +260 761470673: Yes.
17/10/23, 5:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
17/10/23, 5:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
17/10/23, 5:05 pm - +260 761470673: Yes.
17/10/23, 5:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
17/10/23, 5:19 pm - +260 761470673: Okay.
17/10/23, 5:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
17/10/23, 5:22 pm - +260 761470673: No queries at the moment.
17/10/23, 5:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
17/10/23, 5:26 pm - +260 761470673: Yes. <This message was edited>
17/10/23, 5:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
17/10/23, 5:30 pm - +260 761470673: Alright thanks, you have a blessed day too.
17/10/23, 5:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, and I shall wait for your response for the letter of Recommendation.
17/10/23, 5:33 pm - +260 761470673: Ok
17/10/23, 9:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, with regard to our conversation earlier, may I know if you were able to get your letter of recommendation by now?
17/10/23, 9:33 pm - +260 761470673: I have the letter but it has got some errors and I told them about it and they gave an excuse of not being able to re-do it now because it is late and tomorrow will not be possible because it is a holiday. So am asking if you can postpone this stage to next week, please. I can prove to you that what I am saying is true.
17/10/23, 9:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand your situation, and it's essential to ensure that all the documents are accurate. Postponing this stage to next week to allow time for corrections is a reasonable request. However, please understand that we need to documents so that we can share your application with the universities, and one week will be a long time, please.
17/10/23, 9:36 pm - +260 761470673: Yes,please. Thank you for your understanding.
17/10/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @260761470673 may I know if you were able to go through the message thoroughly?
17/10/23, 9:50 pm - +260 761470673: Yes.
17/10/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, I hope you understand the importance of the document please, in the meantime you can share the letter that has been shared with you today, can I please anticipate that you will be able to update the letter by tomorrow?
17/10/23, 9:58 pm - +260 761470673: Tomorrow it's a public holiday and the teachers insisted that they will be able to re-do it on Sunday.
17/10/23, 10:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, in that case, could you please share the letter that you have received today?
17/10/23, 10:08 pm - +260 761470673: The one that has errors?
17/10/23, 10:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, may be I can have a conversation with the team, and help them understand and buy extension time through the current letter.
17/10/23, 10:12 pm - +260 761470673: <Media omitted>
17/10/23, 10:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the letter, I shall update you tomorrow once I have a discussion with the team.
17/10/23, 10:15 pm - +260 761470673: Okay.
17/10/23, 10:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Could you please share the simple picture without the corrections that you marked?
17/10/23, 10:16 pm - +260 761470673: <Media omitted>
17/10/23, 10:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the letter, I shall update you tomorrow.
17/10/23, 10:37 pm - +260 761470673: Thanks.
20/10/23, 10:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Hastings.

I hope you are doing well, after having a discussion, the team came to the conclusion that you would need a new letter of recommendation since this one does not mention the subjets that you have for your grade 12. You can share the letter by Monday 02:30 pm.
20/10/23, 11:34 pm - +260 761470673: Alright thanks.

15/11/23, 5:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Hasting,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
15/11/23, 5:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
15/11/23, 8:00 pm - +260 761470673: Am sorry, I didn't connect with you because I was traveling and my phone went off.
15/11/23, 8:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please I understand that you must be busy, may I know if you were able to go through the offer letter by now?
15/11/23, 10:01 pm - +260 761470673: Yes, but I didn't really finish it because I the same problem I had
15/11/23, 10:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please let us reconnect tomorrow since it is past our available hours for today we will be reconnecting with you tomorrow at 12:30 pm I hope you will be available to connect with us without any delays.
15/11/23, 10:03 pm - +260 761470673: Yes, sure.
16/11/23, 12:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Hasting.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now to move ahead with the discussion?
16/11/23, 1:18 pm - +260 761470673: Yes please
16/11/23, 1:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
16/11/23, 1:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
16/11/23, 1:20 pm - +260 761470673: Yes
16/11/23, 1:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
16/11/23, 1:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
16/11/23, 1:32 pm - +260 761470673: 1. 900 USD
2. 3 years (6 semester )
3. 300 USD
4. 750 USD
16/11/23, 1:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
16/11/23, 1:51 pm - +260 761470673: Yes
16/11/23, 1:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
16/11/23, 1:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
16/11/23, 1:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
16/11/23, 1:56 pm - +260 761470673: Why is off-campus accommodation cheaper than on-campus
16/11/23, 2:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand, off-campus accommodation is much cheaper and prefered by our students since the students have the freedom to cook for themselves and here they would be paying the rent directly to the landlords on monthly basis hence it is cheaper and all our students prefer off-campus accommodations.
16/11/23, 2:19 pm - +260 761470673: Alright thanks
16/11/23, 2:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
16/11/23, 2:22 pm - +260 761470673: Yes
16/11/23, 2:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
16/11/23, 2:24 pm - +260 761470673: It's clear
16/11/23, 2:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
16/11/23, 2:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
16/11/23, 2:26 pm - +260 761470673: Where are together.
16/11/23, 2:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
16/11/23, 2:29 pm - +260 761470673: Yes
16/11/23, 2:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
16/11/23, 2:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
16/11/23, 2:36 pm - +260 761470673: Yes,

 so even those universities that I have not received letters yet, 28th is their deadline as well?
16/11/23, 2:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @260761470673 no please, for now, your application has been accepted by Galgotia's university and this deadline is for the current offer letter please.
16/11/23, 2:58 pm - +260 761470673: Ok, so I can still wait for other letters, right?
16/11/23, 2:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
16/11/23, 2:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
16/11/23, 2:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
16/11/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
16/11/23, 3:02 pm - +260 761470673: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
16/11/23, 3:33 pm - +260 761470673: No
16/11/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
16/11/23, 3:36 pm - +260 761470673: Ooh ok
16/11/23, 3:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please so may I know if you are clear so far?
16/11/23, 3:37 pm - +260 761470673: Yes
16/11/23, 3:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
16/11/23, 3:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
16/11/23, 3:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, coming to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zambia, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
16/11/23, 3:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, most of the students from Zambia prefer to process the payment through our associate Mr. Hammond (Penmal Connect) since it is more convenient and the transfer charges are only 5% of the amount you want to send. 

May I know if you would be able to use the same mode to process the payment of your registration fee as well?
16/11/23, 3:46 pm - +260 761470673: Not,
Which university has the most Edoofians and why?
16/11/23, 5:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, kindly excuse me for the delay, It was our dinner break, please. Let me help you with your concern here. Edoofains are in all universities please, the students choose the universities according to their preference many students prefer Galgotia's university since it is affordable and has the finest education.
16/11/23, 6:33 pm - +260 761470673: Alright
16/11/23, 6:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please so may I know if you want me to share the details for Mr. Hmmond as well?
16/11/23, 6:48 pm - +260 761470673: Yes
16/11/23, 6:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, do the same. If you and your parents wish to use the same mode of payment as before, you can do that as well. Let me reshare the account details with you once -
16/11/23, 6:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Account Name* - Penmal Connect Limited
*Account Number* - 0222030000591
*Name of Bank* - Indo Zambia Bank
*Branch Name* - Jacaranda
*Sort Code* - 090122
*Swift Code* - INZAZMLX

Team, these are the updated details for payment from Zambia, please ensure you use these details from here on
16/11/23, 6:59 pm - +260 761470673: We will discuss about and we'll give a feedback
16/11/23, 7:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
16/11/23, 7:34 pm - +260 761470673: I get it
16/11/23, 7:34 pm - +260 761470673: Thanks
16/11/23, 7:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
16/11/23, 7:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
16/11/23, 7:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
16/11/23, 7:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
16/11/23, 7:46 pm - +260 761470673: Yes
16/11/23, 7:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
16/11/23, 7:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
16/11/23, 7:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?

17/11/23, 2:04 pm - +260 761470673: It's fantastic
17/11/23, 2:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I ma glad to hear that before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
17/11/23, 2:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
17/11/23, 2:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on Monday 20th November. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
17/11/23, 2:08 pm - +260 761470673: Yes, it really does and you a great weekend ma'am 😊.
17/11/23, 2:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you have a great weekend to you too.
17/11/23, 2:12 pm - +260 761470673: Thanks
17/11/23, 2:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.
20/11/23, 12:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Hasting!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Galgotias University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
21/11/23, 12:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Hasting,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I had anticipated receiving a response from you, but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply, although I did notice that you have read my previous message. May I kindly ask if we are still connected?
21/11/23, 5:00 pm - +260 761470673: Sorry I missed yesterday and today's session because I was held up for some family matters.
21/11/23, 6:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, I understand that you must be occupied. May I know if you are comfortable to proceed with the discussion now?
22/11/23, 12:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Hasting.

I hope you are doing well. I hope this message reaches you in good health. I have been looking forward to a response from you following my previous message. However, I understand that you might not have had the chance to reply yet. Could you please confirm if we are still in communication?
22/11/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that, however, @260966650712 could you please help me understand you breakdown of the total of $1950 please?
22/11/23, 9:09 pm - +260 96 6650712: 300$ Admission and procedure fee
900$ tuition fees 
750$ Registration fee
22/11/23, 9:18 pm - +260 96 6650712: <Media omitted>

22/11/23, 9:19 pm - +260 96 6650712: Then there are those payments 👆
22/11/23, 9:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
22/11/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The above cost is the annual break up, however, for the first year the registration fee of $750 will be adjusted towards your per annum cost of education which is $2800- $750= $2050.

This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
22/11/23, 9:24 pm - +260 96 6650712: Is this the amount that is supposed to be paid by those on scholarship?
22/11/23, 9:24 pm - +260 96 6650712: 100% scholarship?
22/11/23, 9:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: let me help you understand better @260966650712. Your application has already been shared with our multiple partner universities including the one for 100% scholarship, and once we receive a response from their side, we will let you know. 

As of now, the first letter that you have received is from Galgotias University and they have presented you with a 50% scholarship. I hope this clears you doubts?
23/11/23, 8:25 am - +260 96 6650712: Oh! I get it now. 
Well, in that case we will wait for other universities who may present us with 100% scholarship because we can not afford the offer for Galgotias.
23/11/23, 12:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Hasting.

I hope you are doing well. Since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can move ahead with our discussion?
23/11/23, 12:54 pm - +260 96 6650712: Yes
23/11/23, 1:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your message above. I understand and Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
23/11/23, 1:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

23/11/23, 1:28 pm - +260 96 6650712: Yes, thank you.
23/11/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
23/11/23, 2:15 pm - +260 96 6650712: Yes, but right now, we will not be able to afford the fees for Galgotias if university A does not give us a scholarship
23/11/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand, however, It would be really appreciated if you could help me understand what are the challenges that you are facing please?
23/11/23, 7:00 pm - +260 96 6650712: We are not financially viable for that university
24/11/23, 12:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Hasting.

I hope you are doing well and this message reaches you in good health. Since we were unable to continue with our conversation yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now to move ahead with the discussion?
24/11/23, 12:48 pm - +260 761470673: Yes
24/11/23, 3:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand that financial concerns can be a big challenge, however, with the transfer option you will have the opportunity to reserve your seat here, and even explore more opportunities.

 Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
