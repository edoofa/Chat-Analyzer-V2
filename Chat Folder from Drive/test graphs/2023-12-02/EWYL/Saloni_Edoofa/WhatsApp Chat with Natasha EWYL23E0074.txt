10/08/23, 1:49 pm - +263 78 648 1446: Okay I remember us discussing on the projects that must be done . I think the first one is about communicating with companies and for that we need to create a LinkedIn account and the other one is introducing other people to the edoofa program which is a community building project
10/08/23, 1:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That's awesome Natasha!

So I would preferably start again from the second project again so that we can refresh our discussion and develop new ideas💭
But if you want then we can restart from the first project. Tell me, what do you think?
10/08/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 648 1446: I think the first project is best to start from
10/08/23, 2:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, that is great!

I will do that as you say Natasha.
10/08/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 648 1446: Thank you
10/08/23, 2:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
10/08/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 648 1446: Okay I will do that
10/08/23, 2:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>

10/08/23, 2:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share what all you learned form it?
10/08/23, 2:29 pm - +263 78 648 1446: I learnt that will communicating with companies with their mangers etc. Telling them about edoofa and we will be using LinkedIn in order to find their details so as to set meetings with them. These companies have to technological companies.

11/08/23, 2:29 pm - +263 78 648 1446: That when searching for the company one must look at the nature of the company which is the scale referring to the number of people in the company, the financial stability of the company, information about the founder and for one to find the information it is through the use of LinkedIn

28/08/23, 2:10 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That will be awesome Natasha, I will wait for the complete details.
28/08/23, 2:11 pm - +263 71 243 1513: Okay thank you
28/08/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
28/08/23, 2:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Natasha/Saloni/28AUG2023*
28/08/23, 2:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
28/08/23, 2:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
28/08/23, 2:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
28/08/23, 2:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
28/08/23, 2:15 pm - +263 71 243 1513: Thank you it's understood
28/08/23, 2:17 pm - +263 71 243 1513: But can i also share information about edoofa to people who want to study at India but are not particularly form 6 for instance maybe someone who wants to study abroad
28/08/23, 2:19 pm - +263 71 243 1513: Can I also communicate via Facebook or create a page on Facebook to share  this information to other people
28/08/23, 2:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/08/23, 2:33 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
29/08/23, 1:31 pm - +263 78 648 1446: Good afternoon
29/08/23, 1:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

May we begin with our session📖
29/08/23, 1:42 pm - +263 78 648 1446: Yes we may
29/08/23, 1:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Did you form the group that we last discussed?

29/08/23, 2:10 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Did you add me in the group?
29/08/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 648 1446: Yes I did
29/08/23, 2:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May I know what have you named the group?
29/08/23, 2:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/08/23, 2:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Name that one group as Natasha/Saloni/28AUG2023
29/08/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 648 1446: Okay
29/08/23, 2:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I'll see you on *Thursday* from 01:30-02:30 PM since the organization will remain closed on the occasion of our Indian festival _Raksha Bandhan_�

Raksha Bandhan is a Hindu festival celebrated to honor the special bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a sacred thread called a "rakhi" around their brothers' wrists, symbolizing their love and protection. In return, the brothers promise to look after and support their sisters. It's a day of joy, gift-giving, and strengthening the sibling relationship.
29/08/23, 2:39 pm - +263 78 648 1446: Have a wonderful time on this special day
31/08/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: _Greetings of the day!_
How are you?

So, I would like to share a piece of happiness that I experienced and received from my family yesterday. As I informed you yesterday we were celebrating Raksha Bandhan, let me share a glimpse of how I celebrated at my side👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🫱🏻‍🫲🏼
31/08/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/08/23, 4:15 pm - +263 77 242 4779: Wow wonderful.
31/08/23, 4:56 pm - +263 71 243 1513: Wonderful occasion
01/09/23, 2:20 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, we can do that.
01/09/23, 2:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since I want you to have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and focus on your exams. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
01/09/23, 2:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Deepali, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till ___ (date) because I am having my exams from __ to ___ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Saloni as soon as I get over with my exams.
(Attach your date sheet along with this.)
Send it to - deepali@edoofa.com, and saloni.edoofa@gmail.com, ewyl@edoofa.com


Once done, please let me know.
15/09/23, 4:30 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
15/09/23, 4:30 pm - Saloni Edoofa: In case you, as a student, are not available, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Tuesday and Friday* from *12:30  PM to 01:30 PM*⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.
16/09/23, 6:12 am - +263 71 243 1513: Good morning understood, really appreciate we can start next week with us parents as she is at. School preparing for her final examinations.

19/09/23, 12:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now, it’s been an interesting conversation with you so far. However, I have some cool things left to share and thus, I think we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
19/09/23, 12:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 12:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: As a proud edoofian and as a student who is going to go for international higher education, you will connect with various principals on this project.

22/09/23, 12:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

Let's begin with our session🥳
22/09/23, 12:58 pm - +263 71 243 1513: Greetings, let us beginning
22/09/23, 1:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey, these are mandatory to follow. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.


When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceeding with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know.
22/09/23, 1:12 pm - +263 71 243 1513: Let's continue when the student is available, when they finish their final examinations.
22/09/23, 1:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, I am completely with you on this, just that these are some mandatory formalities that need to be performed before she takes over her journey on the date you have mentioned regarding the availability of the student. I will not begin anything before she herself is present for sessions with me. Just that these are certain basic mandatory requirements that need to be fulfilled.
22/09/23, 1:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please note a few things:
FIRST- Please choose your batch for your sessions. Either it has to be 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
or 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
22/09/23, 1:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days you will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
22/09/23, 1:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.

22/09/23, 1:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

I think Zimbabwe and India, despite their geographical and cultural differences, share certain similarities in their festive traditions. Both countries celebrate major festivals with vibrant colors, music, and a strong sense of community. Both nations also celebrate various agricultural festivals, reflecting the importance of farming in their societies. Additionally, the idea of family and community bonding is central to both countries' celebrations, emphasizing the significance of togetherness during these festive occasions.
