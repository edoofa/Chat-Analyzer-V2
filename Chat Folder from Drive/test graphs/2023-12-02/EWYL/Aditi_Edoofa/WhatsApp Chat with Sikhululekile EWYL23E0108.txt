22/08/23, 2:28 pm - +91 78273 08969: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments

They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
22/08/23, 2:30 pm - +91 72081 62024: Okay,thank you mam.
22/08/23, 2:31 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
22/08/23, 2:31 pm - +91 78273 08969: Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
22/08/23, 2:32 pm - +91 72081 62024: Yes mam
22/08/23, 2:33 pm - +91 72081 62024: This is amazing,I'm very glad to hear that.
22/08/23, 2:33 pm - +91 78273 08969: Also, I want to emphasise that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
22/08/23, 2:35 pm - +91 72081 62024: Thank you so much mam
22/08/23, 2:35 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now, I'm providing you with a comprehensive FAQ document that addresses all potential queries. It's advisable for both you and your parents to review it thoroughly. If any additional questions arise, please make a note of them so that we can address them in our future discussions.
22/08/23, 2:35 pm - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
22/08/23, 2:36 pm - +91 72081 62024: Thank you for sharing.We will surely do so.
22/08/23, 2:39 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now, I assume you've had the chance to review the Grant Letter. Now, I would really appreciate it if you and your parents proceed with signing the undertaking of the Grant Letter, which will serve as the formal acceptance of your grant.

Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride. It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.

She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Aditi's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.

01/10/23, 11:13 am - +91 72081 62024: Greetings to you.From the webinar that was held,I managed to understand that, communication is the passing of information to get the desired results.The communication cycle involves the sender->encode->transmit->decode->response . Public speaking,idea composition and identifying audience needs are the learned skill components of communication.The most important is identifying audience needs.Systems help with narrative/story structure and can help one to be stay on track and be more effective.Storytelling is the narrative action or sequence of events ,insight or transportation.Storytelling is memorable and easier to retell.Storytelling can be used through case studies , warnings,using case scenarios and ultimately advance a cause.I learnt a lot and it's very important to have the good communication skills in life.The information will help me a lot in life.Thank  you so much for giving me the opportunity to attend the webinar.

What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship?I learned that it is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and in African Continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.For about 6 years, Edoofa has worked with more than 250 universitiees in India and has more than 3000 students from different countries.Edoofa receives so many applications, from different countries in Africa like Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi , Kenya and and so many. However , for more than 50 000 applications there are about 2100 seats which will denotes the intense competition in the process and those chosen may be helped.

Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)? Because my mother is striving to pay for my A level fees .However I'm anticipating that due to shortage of fees, After my A level I might be forced not to go further with School .

) Student's journey so far with the program,
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) Highlighting the importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with your counselor and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Their initial feedback of how life is different in India how the basic amenities are cheaper as compared to your homeland (you may use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by themselves and struggling with the process. (you may refer to DSW's Help in explaining the normal process as compared to Edoofa's Process)
f) Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.

15/11/23, 4:59 pm - Aditi Edoofa: WEDNESDAY LESSON OF THE WEEK

Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

Can you recall what they were?

23/11/23, 2:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Over the last few months, we've been checking how well you're doing.

23/11/23, 2:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the students who can use their grant amount this semester*

23/11/23, 2:45 pm - +91 72081 62024: Okay mam
23/11/23, 2:47 pm - Aditi Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75%.
23/11/23, 2:49 pm - +91 72081 62024: Okay mam
23/11/23, 2:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Considering a total of 6 sessions with your mentor (2 in September & 4 in October), 6 webinars (4 in September & 2 in October), and positive attendance in the orientation session that took place at your University, you currently stand at:
23/11/23, 2:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Criteria	   September + October

23/11/23, 3:25 pm - +91 72081 62024: Okay mam
I have one question only,ever since I began the sessions with you,did I miss any?
23/11/23, 3:25 pm - Aditi Edoofa: No, you didn't miss even one session.
23/11/23, 3:29 pm - +91 72081 62024: Okay, I'm glad to hear that,so does that mean I attended all the 4 sessions in October since  we started the journey on 4 October? <This message was edited>

23/11/23, 3:35 pm - +91 72081 62024: Okay mam
23/11/23, 3:41 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, if I talk about you, Right now, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount.
23/11/23, 3:42 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I noticed you've already earned $62, and I have a vision to help you triple that amount. But, it'll only work if you're ready to team up with me daily for the next 30 days. Picture it as a journey where we work side by side, shaping a future that makes you and your parents proud and happy, ultimately securing that grant for you. If you commit to staying in touch with me and working on the projects for the next 30 days, I believe you can earn back the grant amount for yourself.
Are you willing to put all your efforts for the next 30 days?
23/11/23, 3:49 pm - +91 72081 62024: Right now, I'm in confusion on the whole issue because I attended all the webinars except for the one when there was a Flair at our college.On the sessions too,I don't know which ones I missed.I will try to put my efforts.
23/11/23, 3:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, if this is the case then I will surely look into it again and get back to you with it.
23/11/23, 3:52 pm - +91 72081 62024: Okay,thank you mam
23/11/23, 3:54 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Sure, I trust you've reviewed my earlier messages. I'd appreciate it if you could discuss your understanding of them with me tomorrow. Currently, you're not eligible, but you're on the brink of eligibility as I said I will look into it. 
My primary goal is for you to earn scholarship credits beyond the grant amount. To facilitate this, I'd like to schedule a special set of classes for you as I know that you have the potential. I'll share the timetable with you shortly.
23/11/23, 3:54 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I hope it's clear?
