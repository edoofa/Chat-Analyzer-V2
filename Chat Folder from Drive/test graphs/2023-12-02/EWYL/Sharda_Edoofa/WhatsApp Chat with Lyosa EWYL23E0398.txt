Here is the message -
23/08/23, 8:50 am - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends

I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.

Best of Luck!

We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Here with I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.

24/08/23, 9:14 am - Sharda Edoofa: Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
24/08/23, 9:15 am - Sharda Edoofa: If the School is *not connected* with Edoofa:

Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
24/08/23, 9:15 am - Sharda Edoofa: If the School *is connected* with Edoofa:

It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
24/08/23, 9:15 am - Sharda Edoofa: Are you following Lyosa?
24/08/23, 9:25 am - +263 71 787 9157: Yes l am
24/08/23, 9:37 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
24/08/23, 9:37 am - Sharda Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
24/08/23, 9:37 am - Sharda Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_
24/08/23, 9:37 am - Sharda Edoofa: Dear Mr./Mrs. [School Head's Name],
I hope you are in good health and high spirits.
I am writing to you as a proud beneficiary of the esteemed _Edoofa Scholarship Program_ and I feel privileged to have the opportunity to connect with you today.

I am thrilled to share with you that I have been selected to pursue my higher education in India through the Edoofa Scholarship Program. This incredible opportunity allows me to fulfill my dream of receiving a quality education at an affordable price. Not only will I gain knowledge in my chosen field of study, but I will also acquire valuable skills that will set me apart in today's competitive world and increase my employability.
*I firmly believe that students at your esteemed institution should also have access to such life-changing opportunities. Together, we can empower our students to realize their dreams and equip them with the tools needed for a successful and fulfilling future*

As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

 *Week 1*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group

 *Week 2*: Call on Saturday
📅: 21/10/2023

 *Week 3*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:00-06:45 PM
📅 25/10/2023 

 *Week 4*: Call on Saturday 
📅: 04/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go through the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!

25/11/23, 3:30 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Lyosa, 

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,
Team EWYL
28/11/23, 11:57 pm - +91 81469 63958: The spirit of competition typically refers to the attitude, mindset, and behaviors associated with engaging in competitive activities. It involves a desire to excel, improve, and achieve success, often in comparison to others. The spirit of competition is often driven by a desire to achieve excellence and surpass one's own limits. It fosters a commitment to continuous improvement and personal growth.Competition often involves facing challenges and overcoming obstacles. The spirit of competition encourages individuals to view challenges as opportunities for growth and learning rather than insurmountable obstacles.Competition provides a framework for setting and pursuing goals. The spirit of competition helps individuals focus on their objectives, channeling their energy and efforts toward achieving specific outcomes.Facing competition can build resilience by exposing individuals to setbacks and failures. The ability to bounce back from defeats, learn from mistakes, and persevere is a crucial aspect of the competitive spirit.While competition often involves individuals striving for personal success, it can also foster a sense of community and collaboration. Healthy competition encourages individuals to support and inspire each other to achieve their best.The competitive spirit involves acknowledging and celebrating achievements, both individual and collective. Recognition serves as motivation and reinforcement for continued efforts.

As for me, the spirit of competition has brought me to where I am. I wasn't good at my studies since childhood, but after encountering hardworking and smart friends, I started to excel in my life because I wanted to challenge them as well as challenge myself. Unfortunately, for the final exams, I couldn't perform as well as I wanted since there was limited time. As I progressed with my education, I adopted a mindset of competition, always wanting to challenge myself. The spirit of competition is what has made me who I am today.
