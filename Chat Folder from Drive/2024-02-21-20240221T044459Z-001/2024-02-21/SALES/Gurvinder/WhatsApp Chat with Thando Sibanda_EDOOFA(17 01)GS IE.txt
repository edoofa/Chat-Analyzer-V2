17/01/24, 3:37 pm - +263 77 107 2314: Thank you
17/01/24, 3:40 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you more.
17/01/24, 3:40 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
17/01/24, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
17/01/24, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
17/01/24, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
17/01/24, 3:49 pm - +263 77 107 2314: Yes please,  I am looking forward to the opportunity to be independent , further my studies for higher education and indeed I feel it reduces the burden on my parents
17/01/24, 3:57 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Thando, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
17/01/24, 4:03 pm - +263 77 107 2314: I believe and have faith in myself and my parents ,that I do have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarships
17/01/24, 10:04 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

23/01/24, 9:02 am - +263 77 107 2314: Good morning, Sir
23/01/24, 9:22 am - Gurvinder: May I know, why were you inactive yesterday?
23/01/24, 9:24 am - +263 77 107 2314: Yesterday I was collecting the results at school, alot of students were present and the process ended up taking the entire day for every student to be cleared
23/01/24, 9:48 am - Gurvinder: Please, you could have conveyed to me that you will not be active due to these reasons yesterday?
23/01/24, 9:57 am - +263 77 107 2314: I apologize sir, it will not happen again ,
23/01/24, 10:11 am - Gurvinder: May I know, why didn't you take chemistry if you wanted to do Mining engineering?
23/01/24, 10:20 am - +263 77 107 2314: Upon investigation we were told that Mining Engineering required mostly Pure Mathematics and Physics so i used T G instead of Chemistry as a back up that if I didn't perform well in Physics for Mining Engineering I would consider Architectural engineering or Civil Engineering
23/01/24, 10:36 am - Gurvinder: Thando, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
23/01/24, 11:10 am - +263 77 107 2314: Sir, does this mean that I do not have required criteria to study in India
23/01/24, 12:07 pm - Gurvinder: Please you can go ahead with Computer Engineering and Electrical engineering, and also any commercial course since you had maths.
23/01/24, 12:17 pm - +263 77 107 2314: Yess I would be interested in Electrical Engineering
23/01/24, 1:00 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
23/01/24, 1:00 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
23/01/24, 1:11 pm - +263 77 107 2314: I understand
23/01/24, 1:11 pm - +263 77 107 2314: Yes I am confident in achieving it
23/01/24, 1:43 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
23/01/24, 2:09 pm - +263 77 107 2314: Yes I would love that
23/01/24, 2:24 pm - Gurvinder: *Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering* is a 4 years degree course. Electrical engineering is one of the most sought-after branches of engineering

23/01/24, 3:25 pm - +263 77 107 2314: Well what I have understood is that  the course offers a wide variety of options for me as an individual to explore a lot of opportunities in the field and most it offers me a  chance to tap into my creative side as a problem solver to the highest degree, 5 years after completion I see my self work hard to be best in my field , learning a lot , gaining experience to pursue much more intricate sectors in the field. My dream was to become a engineer and mining was the course I saw fit in the engineering sector but I can see that It offers plenty of interesting sectors and that has me curious of how high I can aim as an engineer .My aim is to advance as high as possible in my field so that I can inspire my fellow countrymen that it is possible to achieve your dreams and I plan to also have an impact in my country, raise awareness to young students to take their education seriously.Last but not least I would be able to retire my parents and make them proud for all their hardwork , I can change my family's lives.

23/01/24, 3:31 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
23/01/24, 3:37 pm - +263 77 107 2314: Studying abroad has always been a dream of mine, as I admired it and now I have the opportunity to do it.
I feel offers me opportunities to gain work overseas and I would love that
23/01/24, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
23/01/24, 3:44 pm - +263 77 107 2314: After studying abroad I would like to come back to my country offer my skills and learnings to the Zimbabwe Power Station and offer my services to enhance the efficiency in the production of electricity and solve problems, I also would love to go my school and serve as beckon of light for them to aim as high as possible in the studies , as many students tend to neglect their education due to the economic situation buh I want to be that person that say" you can study abroad come back and add value to your country ,solve problems in your country" that is my plan
23/01/24, 3:45 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Thando, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
23/01/24, 3:46 pm - +263 77 107 2314: I very much agree , a conducive environment provides good results
23/01/24, 3:51 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
23/01/24, 3:53 pm - +263 77 107 2314: Yes it does share similar history with most  African countries, one of them being Zimbabwe too
23/01/24, 3:57 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
23/01/24, 4:11 pm - +263 77 107 2314: As of now I do not have any questions but if I do I will ask them
23/01/24, 10:20 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

God Bless You!
24/01/24, 6:58 am - +263 77 107 2314: Thank Sir
Same also to you have a good day ahead
24/01/24, 8:18 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*"Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better. "*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
24/01/24, 9:06 am - +263 77 107 2314: Good morning, Sir
We may begin
24/01/24, 9:16 am - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
24/01/24, 10:00 am - +263 77 107 2314: Yes we have researched and did discover it is quite costly for an international student without any scholarship in India
24/01/24, 10:06 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
24/01/24, 10:06 am - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
24/01/24, 10:06 am - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
24/01/24, 10:07 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 10:07 am - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
24/01/24, 10:26 am - +263 77 107 2314: In comparison yes the scholarship offers a lot of great of opportunities I can see

The earn while you learn program ,may I know what is it about?
24/01/24, 10:45 am - Gurvinder: Thando, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
24/01/24, 11:29 am - +263 77 107 2314: It's an amazing program I would love to partake in it, the project offers alot of interesting skills that one acquire
24/01/24, 12:10 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
24/01/24, 12:10 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
24/01/24, 12:10 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

24/01/24, 12:11 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
24/01/24, 12:56 pm - +263 77 107 2314: I think this will benefit me a lot, I have just watched the multiple students in the life of an Edoofian vlogs and the benefits of being an Edoofian in great
24/01/24, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Thando, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
24/01/24, 1:03 pm - +263 77 107 2314: I am up for the challenge it is beneficiary for me and the family, it's a good structured program
24/01/24, 1:07 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

24/01/24, 1:07 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
24/01/24, 1:17 pm - +263 77 107 2314: Yes it is something I have been looking for in terms of my international education, it is a great opportunity and it does ease the burden on my parents, I would be glad to be a part of EWYL program
24/01/24, 1:25 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Thando, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
24/01/24, 1:26 pm - +263 77 107 2314: Correct, my family members would be supporting me for my higher education
24/01/24, 1:34 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
24/01/24, 1:34 pm - +263 77 107 2314: Indeed, I have discussed the international education plans with them
24/01/24, 1:47 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
24/01/24, 1:48 pm - +263 77 107 2314: I am ready
24/01/24, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: Thando as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
24/01/24, 1:58 pm - +263 77 107 2314: After Application to 5 universities the student would end up spending between $1500-$2250
24/01/24, 2:03 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Thando, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
24/01/24, 2:03 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 2:08 pm - +263 77 107 2314: I understand , the fee amount is okay, 
Does this mean the Deadline is on the 31st of January
24/01/24, 2:09 pm - Gurvinder: Please, the deadline will be given after you are found eligible for the program.
24/01/24, 2:09 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
24/01/24, 2:12 pm - +263 77 107 2314: Yes indeed, the program is revolutionizing the admission process
24/01/24, 2:13 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
24/01/24, 2:13 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
24/01/24, 2:13 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
24/01/24, 2:16 pm - +263 77 107 2314: Okay I do understand the payment policy
24/01/24, 2:19 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
24/01/24, 2:21 pm - +263 77 107 2314: Yess I am familiar with the Edoofa cycle
24/01/24, 2:22 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 2:22 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Thando, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
24/01/24, 2:22 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
24/01/24, 2:24 pm - +263 77 107 2314: Yes I do understand
24/01/24, 2:26 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
24/01/24, 2:26 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
24/01/24, 2:26 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
24/01/24, 2:27 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
24/01/24, 2:28 pm - +263 77 107 2314: Noted, I understand
24/01/24, 2:29 pm - +263 77 107 2314: Okay I understand
24/01/24, 2:29 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
24/01/24, 2:29 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
24/01/24, 2:29 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the *8th or 9th of February 2024*

Thank you
05/02/24, 12:23 pm - Gurvinder: So after going through the letter, do you or your family have any questions?
05/02/24, 12:32 pm - +263 77 107 2314: Currently we do not have any questions, but when we do we'll surely ask them
05/02/24, 12:33 pm - Gurvinder: Thando, what I meant to ask was that since you must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

Which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
05/02/24, 12:51 pm - +263 77 395 8637: Good day ,we were thinking of option 2 ,please may you brief us on this mode
05/02/24, 12:53 pm - Gurvinder: Basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
05/02/24, 12:54 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

05/02/24, 1:46 pm - Gurvinder: Please you can transfer any amount of transfer charges now, but the total should amount to $44.
05/02/24, 2:02 pm - +263 77 395 8637: ok thank you

I would like you to come online and please confirm if you are going to complete the enrollment formalities today?
08/02/24, 1:05 pm - +263 77 395 8637: Good morning Mr Gurvinder .
Due to certain circumstances we have taken the initiative to withdraw from the scholarship program , we are grateful for the opportunity that's been given to our son to study abroad. 
We sincerely apologize for any inconveniences ,and as we part ways I want to take this opportunity again to say thank you for this once in a lifetime opportunity
08/02/24, 1:06 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, why is that the case?
08/02/24, 1:32 pm - +263 77 395 8637: It may be due certain costs we feel may be above us,  for instance the figure range that we assumed would cost us for the 1st year which includes registration fee depending on the university,  airline fees , accommodation fees  (that is if they're non present in the acquired scholarship), food costs , visa , pocket money , and our dug up research we found may exceed our budget ranging between 2500-3000.
08/02/24, 1:40 pm - Gurvinder: @263773958637, I understand that in the first year the cost can exceed from the given range of $2000-3000 due to the enrollment fee and the travel expenses, but keep in mind that the session starts in August, which means if we suppose that a student can earn $100 per month through the EWYL program, they would already have $600 in the form of scholarship credits for the tuition fees, which will balance out all the extra expenses that there are for the first year, don't you think so?
08/02/24, 1:44 pm - +263 77 395 8637: I will respond around 4pm
08/02/24, 1:53 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time.

09/02/24, 10:33 am - +263 77 395 8637: May we know , after the $2000-3000$ once of payment is made , what further costs would we face in the following years in terms of fees per month
09/02/24, 11:01 am - +263 77 395 8637: As your may know our country's economy has been shaky for the longest and the employment crisis is at its peak in every sector and industry,  retrenchments being a commonality,  all in the best interests of the child as we think about the future as anything can happen in the event of a misfortune,  
We'd like to know in the following years he's doing his studies what would the expenditure structure be like?....
09/02/24, 11:52 am - Gurvinder: Please, as I told you, the cost of education would remain the same, that is $2000-3000 per yearw which can be reduced too by the EWYL program, and as explained here, in the first year too, it won't exceed your budget, plus if you want you can even enrol for the next year's intake, which would give her enough time to even earn her whole first year's fee through the EWYL program. <This message was edited>
09/02/24, 11:53 am - Gurvinder: You see during our founder’s visit this year, we encountered Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program in 2018-2019 but hadn't proceeded due to the lure of quick earnings within the country. However, this year, those student shared their hardships, with some holding prestigious degrees from institutions like UZ, MSU, and HIT, now working as petrol attendants or mobile/laptop repair technicians. Others faced even greater challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

It's evident from these experiences that many students regret not taking the benefit of The Edoofa Program's opportunity earlier. As your counselor, I understand the challenges in your home country. What are your thoughts or insights on this situation, @263773958637 ?
09/02/24, 12:00 pm - +263 77 395 8637: Good afternoon ,I think it's best we take this route and enrol next year, and in the mean time we work on a better budget ,thank you
09/02/24, 12:08 pm - Gurvinder: @263773958637 Please understand that the EWYL program can only be started for the child if she enrols with the program this year, enrolling now would help your child to start the EWYL program now, collect scholarship credits until the next year's intake, will teach her to be responsible for her own education, and would save you the cost of reapplication fee.
