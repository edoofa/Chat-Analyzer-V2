*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!

02/01/24, 8:05 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
03/01/24, 9:24 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

03/01/24, 4:29 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
04/01/24, 9:50 am - +263 78 110 6398: OK sir
04/01/24, 9:56 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Mukiwa, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Tanatswa, is that correct?
04/01/24, 9:57 am - +263 78 110 6398: Yes
04/01/24, 10:10 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Tanatswa, also do tell me whether you learnt about Tanatswa’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
04/01/24, 10:15 am - +263 78 110 6398: Tanatswa did not tell   me about his / her journey...

04/01/24, 10:21 am - +263 78 110 6398: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 10:22 am - +263 78 110 6398: Tanatswa only told me that edoofa is an affordability and employability driven higher education option  in india
04/01/24, 10:23 am - +263 78 110 6398: that's  all I learnt from Tanatswa
04/01/24, 11:42 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
04/01/24, 11:42 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you more about the program.
04/01/24, 11:42 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
04/01/24, 11:42 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
04/01/24, 11:42 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
04/01/24, 11:42 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
04/01/24, 3:47 pm - +263 78 110 6398: Yes..  Sir that's  my wish
04/01/24, 3:48 pm - +263 78 110 6398: Now I  understand,  how edoofa works
04/01/24, 3:52 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Mukiwa, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
04/01/24, 3:56 pm - +263 78 110 6398: Yes sir
04/01/24, 3:58 pm - Gurvinder: Now Mukiwa, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

05/01/24, 7:35 pm - +263 78 110 6398: Ada Lovelace motivates me . Ada Lovelace was an English mathematician who worked with Charles Babbage on the design of the Analytical Engine, an early form of a computer. Lovelace is credited with writing the first algorithm intended to be carried out by the Analytical Engine, making her one of the first people to recognize the potential of computers beyond simple calculations. Because of this, she is often considered the world's first computer programmer and the first software engineer. 💻

20/02/24, 1:56 pm - +263 78 110 6398: I think I will become a center of attraction especially in our home country of Zimbabwe..
20/02/24, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: Please give a detailed answer.
20/02/24, 2:00 pm - +263 78 110 6398: I will help  in  improving communication to advancing medical research. Take, for example, social media platforms like Facebook, which have connected people all over the world and given a voice to those who may not have had one before. Or consider computer-aided design (CAD) software, which has revolutionized the design process for architects, engineers, and other professionals. Or think about the ways that medical software has allowed doctors and researchers to better understand and treat diseases. Computer applications have made the world a better place,  by making it a paperless world
20/02/24, 2:03 pm - +263 78 110 6398: Edoofa will help me to fulfill my ambitions since is a well known university and it helps poverty stricken people
20/02/24, 2:04 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Jakwi I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
20/02/24, 2:06 pm - +263 78 110 6398: I will do sir.. It is my wish to change the world from traditional way of living to a modern way
20/02/24, 2:06 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
20/02/24, 2:11 pm - +263 78 110 6398: It is because in Zimbabwe school fees and levies are very high and in Zimbabwe 🇿🇼 technology is very low of which my career needs countries like 🇮🇳india because is advanced in technology
20/02/24, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
20/02/24, 2:50 pm - +263 78 110 6398: In countries like Zimbabwe, where the economy is struggling and the standard of living is low, people with computer application degrees can play a crucial role in helping to improve the situation. They can use their knowledge to develop computer applications that address some of the country's most pressing problems, such as poor health care and limited access to education. For example, an app could be created to allow doctors and patients to communicate remotely, or to provide educational materials to students who don't have access to I traditional schools. Even a small change like this can have a big impact on a country like Zimbabwe.
20/02/24, 2:51 pm - +263 78 110 6398: I will help my country and the world
20/02/24, 2:51 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Jakwi, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
20/02/24, 2:53 pm - +263 78 110 6398: I agree sir
20/02/24, 2:53 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
20/02/24, 2:55 pm - +263 78 110 6398: Yes sir
20/02/24, 2:55 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
20/02/24, 2:55 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

20/02/24, 3:16 pm - +263 78 110 6398: Umm that's great.. It's my wish to be part of edoofa
20/02/24, 3:17 pm - Gurvinder: So now Jakwi, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
20/02/24, 3:18 pm - +263 78 110 6398: No sir.. Now I have a vividly picture of edoofa
20/02/24, 3:19 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
20/02/24, 3:22 pm - +263 78 110 6398: They cannot afford
20/02/24, 3:23 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
20/02/24, 3:23 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
20/02/24, 3:23 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
20/02/24, 3:23 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
20/02/24, 3:23 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
20/02/24, 3:26 pm - +263 78 110 6398: Noted sir...
20/02/24, 3:27 pm - +263 78 110 6398: Ok. Yes I have seen that fees in india is very low and affordable
20/02/24, 3:28 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
20/02/24, 3:29 pm - +263 78 110 6398: Yes sir
20/02/24, 3:31 pm - Gurvinder: Jakwi, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
20/02/24, 3:33 pm - +263 78 110 6398: Okay.. Sir noted.. I think india 🇮🇳 is the best and beautiful country
20/02/24, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
20/02/24, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
20/02/24, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*

20/02/24, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
20/02/24, 3:39 pm - +263 78 110 6398: Yes... I will benefit a lot
20/02/24, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Jakwi, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
20/02/24, 3:42 pm - +263 78 110 6398: Ok.. It is good
20/02/24, 3:44 pm - +263 78 110 6398: Now i'm proud of edoofa..
20/02/24, 3:44 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

20/02/24, 3:44 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
20/02/24, 7:27 pm - +263 78 110 6398: Understood...
