07/02/24, 1:03 pm - Gurvinder: You are lucky to get an opportunity to attend this counseling session this early because of your friend Thelma who is currently studying here in India because of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.  Did your friend introduce you to the parameters of this Scholarship as to How much is the Quantum of Scholarship that we offer? (Eg. 20-50%, 40-80%, 50-100% or is it 100%)
07/02/24, 1:11 pm - +263 71 656 1426: She did not but I was about to ask her
07/02/24, 1:15 pm - Gurvinder changed the group name from "Darlington Magarezano_EDOOFA(05/02)GS IE" to "Darlington Magarezano_EDOOFA(05/02)GS"
07/02/24, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Darlington, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
07/02/24, 1:25 pm - +263 71 656 1426: Yes I have sir
07/02/24, 1:26 pm - Gurvinder: Now Darlington, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

07/02/24, 2:12 pm - Gurvinder: Darlington, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
07/02/24, 2:16 pm - +263 71 656 1426: I understand sir...so does it mean it's over me
07/02/24, 2:17 pm - +263 71 656 1426: So are there any programmes that I can pursue?...I really need your help sir
07/02/24, 2:18 pm - Gurvinder: Studying Geography as part of a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree can offer several benefits for someone interested in pursuing a career in mining engineering:

Understanding of Earth Systems: Geography provides a comprehensive understanding of Earth's physical processes, including landforms, natural resources, and environmental systems. This knowledge is directly relevant to mining engineering, as it helps engineers understand the geological formations and landscapes where mining operations take place.

Geological Context: Geography coursework often includes topics such as geomorphology, geology, and natural resource management. This background knowledge is valuable for mining engineers, as it helps them interpret geological data, assess potential mining sites, and understand the geological risks associated with mining activities.

Spatial Analysis Skills: Geography emphasizes spatial analysis techniques, such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing. These tools are increasingly used in the mining industry for mapping, exploration, and environmental monitoring. By studying Geography, students develop skills in spatial data analysis that are highly relevant to mining engineering.

Environmental Considerations: Mining engineering involves managing environmental impacts associated with mining operations. Geography coursework often explores environmental issues, sustainability, and land use planning, providing students with a broader understanding of the environmental challenges and regulations facing the mining industry.

Interdisciplinary Perspective: Geography is an interdisciplinary field that integrates knowledge from natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities. This interdisciplinary perspective is valuable for mining engineers, as it helps them understand the broader societal, economic, and environmental contexts in which mining activities occur.

Overall, studying Geography can complement a future career in mining engineering by providing students with a strong foundation in earth sciences, spatial analysis skills, and an interdisciplinary understanding of the environmental and social dimensions of mining operations.

08/02/24, 1:51 pm - +263 71 656 1426: Thank you for sharing this👏🏾
08/02/24, 2:14 pm - Gurvinder: So now Darlington, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
08/02/24, 2:47 pm - +263 71 656 1426: Yes...Did you find me suitable to be offered a scholarship?
08/02/24, 2:56 pm - Gurvinder: Please that will be done after the counselling session?
08/02/24, 3:02 pm - +263 71 656 1426: It's okay sir
08/02/24, 3:09 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
08/02/24, 3:35 pm - +263 71 656 1426: Due to my research it sums up to $1 500 United States Dollars
08/02/24, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
08/02/24, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
08/02/24, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
08/02/24, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
08/02/24, 4:31 pm - +263 71 656 1426: Thank you sir
08/02/24, 4:31 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
08/02/24, 5:09 pm - +263 71 656 1426: Yes you can
08/02/24, 8:36 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 11AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
09/02/24, 8:08 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone, 

*"Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice, and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do." - Pelé*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
09/02/24, 9:45 am - +263 71 656 1426: Morning how are you sir
09/02/24, 9:45 am - +263 71 656 1426: You may continue
09/02/24, 9:48 am - Gurvinder: I am fine, how are you?
09/02/24, 2:17 pm - +263 77 791 0505: We are patiently  waiting for the session  earn while you learn program
09/02/24, 2:19 pm - Gurvinder: Mr Magarezano, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
09/02/24, 2:32 pm - +263 77 791 0505: Thank you very much for the informative discussion
09/02/24, 2:32 pm - +263 77 791 0505: It has been  a pleasure to hear from you on this wonderful  platform
09/02/24, 2:32 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
09/02/24, 2:32 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
09/02/24, 2:33 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*
_How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer!_ by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu*
_It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship_ by *Mr. Ronard Kachaje*

09/02/24, 2:33 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
10/02/24, 3:24 am - +263 77 791 0505: Yes certainly
10/02/24, 8:08 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,,
I would like to inform you that, today's session will be till 1.30 PM CAT,
Please come online to participate in today's session.
10/02/24, 9:13 am - +263 71 656 1426: It's okay sir
10/02/24, 9:34 am - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that @263777910505, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
10/02/24, 10:57 am - +263 77 791 0505: It's a very good  program
10/02/24, 10:58 am - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

10/02/24, 10:58 am - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
10/02/24, 11:09 am - +263 77 791 0505: It is okay
10/02/24, 11:12 am - +263 77 791 0505: It a nice program  that help students achieve their educational dreams without hussles
10/02/24, 11:29 am - Gurvinder: Alright Darlington, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
10/02/24, 11:32 am - +263 77 791 0505: I think they will be willing  to assist me through out the duration of higher education
10/02/24, 11:37 am - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
10/02/24, 11:39 am - +263 77 791 0505: Yes I have done with some and will continue  with the remaining  members
10/02/24, 11:40 am - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
10/02/24, 11:40 am - +263 77 791 0505: Yes sir
10/02/24, 11:41 am - Gurvinder: Wonder as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
10/02/24, 11:45 am - +263 77 791 0505: 1500 to$2 250
10/02/24, 11:46 am - Gurvinder: Exactly Wonder, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
10/02/24, 11:46 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
10/02/24, 11:53 am - +263 77 791 0505: It's  okay
10/02/24, 11:53 am - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
10/02/24, 11:55 am - +263 77 791 0505: Yes that is true
10/02/24, 11:56 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
10/02/24, 11:56 am - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
10/02/24, 11:56 am - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
10/02/24, 12:00 pm - +263 77 791 0505: They are able to pay in instalments
10/02/24, 12:01 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is collect.
10/02/24, 1:14 pm - +263 77 791 0505: Thank you very much for the series  of lectures which were both educative and informative
10/02/24, 1:55 pm - +263 71 656 1426: Thank you for sharing the information that was so profound
11/02/24, 11:09 pm - Gurvinder: I will connect with you tomorrow again at 10 AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
12/02/24, 9:15 am - +263 71 656 1426: Thank you sir
12/02/24, 9:25 am - Gurvinder: Good morning! let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

 *Proverbs 3:6*
*"Seek His guidance in all you do, and He will show you the path to take. Embrace education with a heart full of reverence."*

Let's start the session and embrace the transformative power of education
12/02/24, 9:34 am - +263 71 656 1426: Thank you for sharing the word of God...yes we may continue
12/02/24, 10:42 am - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
12/02/24, 10:47 am - +263 71 656 1426: I'm not sir
12/02/24, 12:14 pm - +263 71 656 1426: How much is the registration fee so that I can prepare
12/02/24, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: Please the registration fee will be a part of the cost of education, that is a part $2000-3000, Say suppose, after the scholarship, your fee is $2200, and you are being asked to pay $500 as a registration fee.

Now, being an Edoofa Applicant you have the privilege here of the registration fee being adjusted against your Tuition fee.

Hence the amount of $500 paid as registration fee will be waived off from your Fee and after that, the balance of ($2200-$500=$1700) has to be paid after coming to India in August/September of the year you come in 2 installments. The first part will be $1000 which you will pay in August 2024-2025 and the remaining $700 in January 2025-2026.
12/02/24, 12:33 pm - +263 71 656 1426: Thanks for the clarity I have now understood
12/02/24, 1:00 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
12/02/24, 1:00 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
12/02/24, 1:00 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Hope you are doing well,
Please come online so that we can continue with the session.
20/02/24, 9:55 am - +263 77 791 0505: Good morning sir
20/02/24, 9:55 am - +263 77 791 0505: Iam  Mr Magarezano
20/02/24, 10:08 am - +263 71 656 1426: Morning sir
20/02/24, 10:43 am - +263 77 791 0505: We are online
20/02/24, 11:25 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
20/02/24, 2:32 pm - +263 71 401 7963: Thank you sir
20/02/24, 2:33 pm - Gurvinder: So did you manage to go through the letter?
20/02/24, 2:37 pm - +263 77 791 0505: We are still going through the letter
20/02/24, 2:37 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, please let me know, one you are done.
20/02/24, 3:06 pm - +263 77 791 0505: Iam  through sir
20/02/24, 3:07 pm - Gurvinder: So are there any questions, you would like to ask?
20/02/24, 3:08 pm - +263 77 791 0505: Can we pay through FBC Zimbabwe in Mr Charles  Jerera's master  card account?
20/02/24, 3:09 pm - Gurvinder: Yes please, shall I brief you about that method?
20/02/24, 3:09 pm - +263 77 791 0505: Yes certainly  sir
20/02/24, 3:10 pm - Gurvinder: Basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
20/02/24, 3:11 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333038014048828

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854
20/02/24, 3:13 pm - +263 77 791 0505: Thanks  for clarity
20/02/24, 3:14 pm - +263 77 791 0505: After payment  what is supposed to be done?
20/02/24, 3:15 pm - Gurvinder: Please, you just have to share the receipt.
20/02/24, 3:16 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, when are you going to complete the enrollment formalities so that I can inform the admissions team to start your admission process just after 24-48 hours of us confirming the payment.
20/02/24, 3:19 pm - +263 77 791 0505: On Thursday since tomorrow  is Our National Youth Day  it is a national  holiday banks will be closed
20/02/24, 3:19 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
