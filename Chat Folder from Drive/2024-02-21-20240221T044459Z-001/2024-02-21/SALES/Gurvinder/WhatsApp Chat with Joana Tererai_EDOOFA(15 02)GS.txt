16/02/24, 1:01 pm - +263 78 007 1892: Greetings to u all
16/02/24, 1:02 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Joana, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Tafadzwa, is that correct? <This message was edited>
16/02/24, 1:03 pm - +263 78 007 1892: Yes
16/02/24, 1:06 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Tafadzwa, also do tell me whether you learnt about Tafadzwa’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
16/02/24, 1:19 pm - +263 78 007 1892: In short l can say l learnt that Edoofa helped Tafadzwa to fulfil her dream of studying abroad and also Edoofa is a institution which offers 50 %scholarships to student and it shares your application with other universities so that you can learn there.Also,Edoofa program helped Tafadzwa to study until she become a pharmacist.
16/02/24, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
16/02/24, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
16/02/24, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
16/02/24, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
16/02/24, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
16/02/24, 1:25 pm - +263 78 007 1892: Mr Gurvinder u can forgive me on my late response because network is troubling me and lm trying to reply fast but u can see that network is very low

16/02/24, 1:28 pm - +263 78 007 1892: Yes it is Mr Gurvinder
16/02/24, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have gotten to know about the scholarship program from Tafadzwa, can you please share your answers to the preliminary 6 questions that your friend might have asked you while sharing the application form with you. So that we can verify your application?
16/02/24, 1:38 pm - +263 78 007 1892: She didn't ask me some questions
16/02/24, 1:38 pm - Gurvinder changed the group name from "Joana Tererai_EDOOFA(15/02)GS IE" to "Joana Tererai_EDOOFA(15/02)GS"
16/02/24, 1:38 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Joana, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
16/02/24, 1:40 pm - +263 78 007 1892: Yes l have
16/02/24, 1:41 pm - Gurvinder: Now Joana, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

Please come online so that we can continue with the session.
17/02/24, 10:20 am - +263 78 007 1892: Good morning Mr Gurvinder
17/02/24, 10:31 am - +263 78 007 1892: Im online now though my network is irritating
17/02/24, 10:45 am - Gurvinder: That is really great Joana I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
17/02/24, 11:51 am - +263 78 007 1892: Ofcourse yes
17/02/24, 11:52 am - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?

17/02/24, 11:55 am - +263 78 007 1892: And also studying abroad has a great advantage when l would like to search for employment in other countries like UK and Others
17/02/24, 11:56 am - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
17/02/24, 12:01 pm - +263 78 007 1892: In my own country.l will be someone who apply my knowledge and skills to make a positive impact especially in some societies
17/02/24, 12:02 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Joana, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
17/02/24, 12:04 pm - +263 78 007 1892: I gree
17/02/24, 12:07 pm - +263 78 007 1892: I will get to know more about my program when l will be studying
17/02/24, 12:45 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
17/02/24, 1:12 pm - +263 78 007 1892: Yes it is
17/02/24, 1:39 pm - +263 78 007 1892: Im sure that India and many African nations do share a similar history of British colonialism and it's interesting to consider how that might impact the education systems in both places , However there are many reasons why India is an attractive destination for higher education.for one , India has a long history of academic excellence and some of the top universities in the world.Additionally, lndiaoffers a diverse range of study options,with a variety of fields and specializations to choose from. And lastly the cost of education in India is often more affordable than in other countries.
17/02/24, 2:05 pm - +263 78 007 1892: That's why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination
19/02/24, 10:08 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,
Hope you are doing well,
Please come online so that we can continue with the session.
19/02/24, 11:40 am - +263 78 007 1892: Morning how are you Mr Gurvinder

19/02/24, 1:08 pm - +263 78 007 1892: Notes
19/02/24, 1:12 pm - Gurvinder: So now Joana, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
19/02/24, 1:39 pm - +263 78 007 1892: Noted
19/02/24, 1:43 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
19/02/24, 1:49 pm - +263 78 007 1892: Yes
19/02/24, 1:51 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
19/02/24, 1:51 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
19/02/24, 1:51 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
19/02/24, 1:51 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
19/02/24, 1:51 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
19/02/24, 1:56 pm - +263 78 007 1892: Olk
19/02/24, 2:00 pm - +263 78 007 1892: This is good
19/02/24, 2:04 pm - +263 78 007 1892: The money is very affordable

Please come online so that we can continue with the session.
20/02/24, 10:16 am - +263 78 007 1892: Morning Mr Gurvinder
20/02/24, 11:17 am - Gurvinder: Please address this.
20/02/24, 11:42 am - +263 78 007 1892: Yes go on
20/02/24, 12:13 pm - Gurvinder: Joana, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
20/02/24, 1:07 pm - +263 78 007 1892: Noted
20/02/24, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

20/02/24, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
20/02/24, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

20/02/24, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
20/02/24, 1:35 pm - +263 78 007 1892: Yea l think so
20/02/24, 1:37 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Joana, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
20/02/24, 1:43 pm - +263 78 007 1892: I gt it
20/02/24, 1:45 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

20/02/24, 1:46 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
20/02/24, 1:56 pm - +263 78 007 1892: Wol this is so good.. Edoofa is awesome
20/02/24, 1:56 pm - +263 78 007 1892: This is a really innovative way to help make higher education more accessible to students.Its like a built-in work study program that offers students the chance to earn while they learn, which can help them pay for their tuition and living expenses and it sounds like the amount that students can earn is really flexible and dependent on their efforts which is a great incentive for them to do well
20/02/24, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Joana, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
20/02/24, 1:57 pm - +263 78 007 1892: Ofcourse yes
20/02/24, 1:59 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
20/02/24, 2:07 pm - +263 78 007 1892: Noted
20/02/24, 2:07 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
20/02/24, 2:09 pm - +263 78 007 1892: Yes lm ready
20/02/24, 2:09 pm - +263 78 007 1892: My network is a bit slow
20/02/24, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: Joana as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
20/02/24, 2:32 pm - +263 78 007 1892: $1500 to$2150
20/02/24, 2:33 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Joana, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
20/02/24, 2:33 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
20/02/24, 2:35 pm - +263 78 007 1892: It will be good
20/02/24, 2:36 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
20/02/24, 2:39 pm - +263 78 007 1892: Olk
20/02/24, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
20/02/24, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
20/02/24, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
20/02/24, 3:26 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
20/02/24, 11:35 pm - +263 78 007 1892: It's alright
20/02/24, 11:46 pm - +263 78 007 1892: I'm sorry Mr Gurvinder l could not continue connecting with since my fon shutdown while we were still in the session
21/02/24, 12:02 am - +263 78 007 1892: So how do l pay the fee
