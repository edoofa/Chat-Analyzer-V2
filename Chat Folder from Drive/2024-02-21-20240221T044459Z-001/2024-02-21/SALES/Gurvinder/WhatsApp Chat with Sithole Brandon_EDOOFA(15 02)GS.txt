19/02/24, 11:13 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.

20/02/24, 11:21 am - Gurvinder: That is great, let me brief you more.
20/02/24, 11:21 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
20/02/24, 11:21 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
20/02/24, 11:21 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
20/02/24, 11:21 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
20/02/24, 11:23 am - +263 77 319 7231: Noted, quite interesting
20/02/24, 11:24 am - +263 77 319 7231: Precisely
20/02/24, 11:26 am - +263 77 319 7231: The situation in Zimbabwe right now is quite tense and a future is uncertain. Financial hardships have caused problems in my education but I am looking for a platform to bounce back from and you are the top recommended help I could find
20/02/24, 11:26 am - +263 77 319 7231: Please, pass my thanks to the brilliant minds who are constantly supporting your program
20/02/24, 11:35 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Mrs Shonani, as we start your son's counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
20/02/24, 11:36 am - +263 77 319 7231: Yes
20/02/24, 11:36 am - +263 77 319 7231: I am dedicated to getting whatever needs to be done and we both will be willing participants
20/02/24, 12:04 pm - Gurvinder: Now Mrs Shonani, I would like to know Sithole better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about him, his career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. His highest education level?
2. The course he would like to study?
3. What do you parents do?
4. What is the parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting him for his Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting him financially for his higher education abroad?
7. Does he have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school does he studies at and in which province is it located along with that how much was his per-term fee in A level?
20/02/24, 3:38 pm - +263 77 319 7231: Anopaishe Brandon Sithole is a young man aged 19, determined and focused in his studies. From a young age, he seemed smart and always has a hands-on approach. His love for sciences started at young age with homemade simple machines and joining the Science Fair Team at both primary and secondary levels. Even though he is not going to school at the moment, he occupies himself with Civil Engineering books and Mechanical experiments and projects. Academically gifted in the Science Department, he attended his Ordinary Level studies at Nkululeko High School where he was a border. He wrote nine subjects including Physics, Biology and Chemistry. He passed all nine subjects and this is his highest level of education. He did attempt to write A level at Denmak Training Services, choosing Pure Mathematics, Physics and Geography. He failed dismally, due to the pressures of being a day scholar and got only 3 points. Denmak Training Services is located in Harare Province and the fees per term was 320USD. Both parents are of working class. The father is a primary grade teacher at Kuwadzana 4 Primary School and mother is a Patrolwoman in Harare City Council. Mr. Sithole's highest level of education is a diploma in motor mechanics and Mrs. Shonani's is Ordinary Level passes. Both the father and mother have been actively supporting his education providing for his fees and his daily needs. The couple will also be responsible for his finances abroad. They will be responsible for his person during the period of his stay. He is the first born of two, his younger sister is now in Grade 7 at K.I.P College. A bounce back is possible for the boy, as he has shown determination and willingness to persue Civil Engineering.
20/02/24, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to know Brandon, Mrs Shonani.
20/02/24, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: So may I know, is he going to attempt his A-levels again or not?
20/02/24, 4:42 pm - +263 77 319 7231: Due to the current situation, I am not able to sponsor him again
20/02/24, 4:55 pm - +263 77 319 7231: Fincial restrictions have closed the opportunity
