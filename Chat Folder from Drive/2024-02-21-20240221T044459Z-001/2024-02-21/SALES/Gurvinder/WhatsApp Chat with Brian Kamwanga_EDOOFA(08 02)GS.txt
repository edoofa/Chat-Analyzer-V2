*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
08/02/24, 9:42 am - +260 97 0939242: Yes please
08/02/24, 10:10 am - +260 97 0939242: Morning sir
08/02/24, 10:38 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Mrs Ntoka,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Piiyush, Head of Counselling and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
08/02/24, 11:09 am - +260 97 0939242: It’s only me Brian here my mom is not in here
08/02/24, 11:10 am - +260 97 0939242: I just want to find out if I have been excepted
08/02/24, 11:20 am - Gurvinder: Please, this is a counselling session, we will find that out through these sessions.
08/02/24, 11:26 am - +260 97 0939242: Okay we can start then
08/02/24, 11:29 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Brain, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Katendi, is that correct?
08/02/24, 11:47 am - +260 97 0939242: Yes that’s correct
08/02/24, 12:12 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Katendi, also do tell me whether you learnt about Katendi’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
08/02/24, 12:35 pm - +260 97 0939242: I never learnt anything from her just talked about applying
08/02/24, 12:38 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you myself.
08/02/24, 12:38 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
08/02/24, 12:38 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
08/02/24, 12:39 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
08/02/24, 12:39 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
08/02/24, 12:39 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 12:39 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 12:39 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
08/02/24, 1:21 pm - +260 97 0939242: Yes sir
08/02/24, 1:21 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Brain, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
08/02/24, 1:27 pm - +260 97 0939242: Yes do tho I don’t have mom and dad but I can put my brother
08/02/24, 1:32 pm - Gurvinder: Please add him to the group yourself.
08/02/24, 1:35 pm - +260 97 0939242: I will sir
08/02/24, 1:40 pm - Gurvinder: Now Brain, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?

*"Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice, and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do." - Pelé*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
09/02/24, 8:32 am - +260 97 8990276: Good Morning All, *Samalesu Kamwanga* is my name and the elder brother to *Brian Kamwanga* who is my depandant, as our parents are peasant farmers who resides in the rural parts of Zambia with no capacity to send him to University so that he fulfills his dream of becoming a medical doctor. thank you for the opportunity to be a part of this process. Brian has always been passionate about  helping the sick people in the family and community, as a brother i have seen this grow in him until now after he completed his secondary school education it is still strong in him, i have no doubt that given the opportunity the school will never regret. Please let me know at what point i can come in to support the process. Thank you🙏
09/02/24, 9:01 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you Mr Kamwanga, I appreciate that you are willing to participate in the session.
09/02/24, 9:01 am - Gurvinder: Is @260970939242 available for the session?
09/02/24, 9:04 am - +260 97 0939242: Yes Sir I am available.
09/02/24, 9:25 am - Gurvinder: So Joyce, may I know, why didn't you take pure Physics and Pure Chemistry in Grade 12?
09/02/24, 9:43 am - +260 97 0939242: Just to be sure you Brian not Joyce? For me Brian,  I started my grade slightly late due to fanatical constraints so at the starting time the pure classes which had Physics and Chemistry alone were full already.
09/02/24, 9:47 am - Gurvinder: Excuse me for that, Brian.
09/02/24, 9:47 am - Gurvinder: Brian, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
09/02/24, 9:47 am - Gurvinder: You see majority of the time students study subjects as per their country's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics

2. Bachelor of Science in Microbiology

3. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology

4. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology

5. Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy

6.Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology

7. Bachelor of science in Biochemistry

8. Bachelor of science in Optometry
09/02/24, 9:58 am - +260 97 0939242: Thank you for clarifying. I will go Bachelor of Science in medical laboratory Technology.
09/02/24, 10:20 am - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
09/02/24, 10:25 am - +260 97 0939242: Yes Sir that will be more helpful
09/02/24, 11:26 am - Gurvinder: A *B.Sc. in Medical Laboratory Technology* is a 3-year undergraduate program that focuses on the skills and knowledge required to work in the field of clinical laboratory science.

09/02/24, 12:00 pm - +260 97 0939242: Yes I did
09/02/24, 12:06 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
09/02/24, 12:10 pm - +260 97 0939242: This message was deleted
09/02/24, 1:21 pm - +260 97 0939242: In 5 years. I see myself doing masters in medical laboratory Technology at edoofa even upgrading my course also if possible and connecting my family, friends to edoofa scholarships .

09/02/24, 1:22 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Brian I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
09/02/24, 1:24 pm - +260 97 0939242: Yes I do Sir
09/02/24, 1:24 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
09/02/24, 1:44 pm - +260 97 0939242: For better education , new perspective and for professional advancement and if you look at your it’s well known such that no one can refuse even studying health career because of your record
09/02/24, 1:46 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
09/02/24, 2:20 pm - +260 97 0939242: Working hard toward my goals in order to attain best results therefore encouraging friends to work hard and participating in school activities etc. also encouraging people from my country to apply for edoofa scholarship, also encouraging the little ones to take A levels at their grade 12 for high chances of being accepted into your university
09/02/24, 2:22 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Brian, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
09/02/24, 2:26 pm - +260 97 0939242: I agree that will take hard work and dedication
09/02/24, 2:29 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
09/02/24, 2:30 pm - +260 97 0939242: Yes Sir
09/02/24, 2:31 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
09/02/24, 2:31 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

1. *Robust Education System:* India has 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges offering diverse educational paths.

2. *Renowned Institutions:* Top-rated Indian universities cover a wide array of fields from engineering to journalism.

09/02/24, 3:02 pm - +260 97 0939242: This is good
09/02/24, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: So now Brian, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
09/02/24, 3:06 pm - +260 97 0939242: Yes I do have questions
09/02/24, 3:07 pm - +260 97 0939242: So what’s next Sir
09/02/24, 3:08 pm - Gurvinder: Please you will be guided that.
09/02/24, 3:49 pm - +260 97 0939242: Noted thank you
09/02/24, 3:50 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
09/02/24, 3:52 pm - +260 97 0939242: No I don’t have any
09/02/24, 3:55 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
09/02/24, 3:55 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
09/02/24, 3:55 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
09/02/24, 3:55 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 3:55 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
09/02/24, 3:58 pm - +260 97 0939242: Ok
09/02/24, 3:59 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?

09/02/24, 4:00 pm - Gurvinder: Brian, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
09/02/24, 4:00 pm - +260 97 0939242: Yes
09/02/24, 4:05 pm - +260 97 0939242: How do this happen when get what percent of scholarship?
09/02/24, 4:06 pm - Gurvinder: Please this program is for everyone enrolled with the Edoofa program.
09/02/24, 4:16 pm - +260 97 0939242: Noted thank you Sir
09/02/24, 4:17 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-

09/02/24, 4:17 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
09/02/24, 4:55 pm - +260 97 0939242: Yes I do like the earn while you learn

10/02/24, 8:12 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,,
I would like to inform you that, today's session will be till 1.30 PM CAT,
Please come online to participate in today's session.
11/02/24, 11:09 pm - Gurvinder: I will connect with you tomorrow again at 10 AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
12/02/24, 7:41 am - +260 97 0939242: Good morning Sir
12/02/24, 9:26 am - Gurvinder: Good morning! let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

 *Proverbs 3:6*
*"Seek His guidance in all you do, and He will show you the path to take. Embrace education with a heart full of reverence."*

Let's start the session and embrace the transformative power of education
12/02/24, 9:28 am - +260 97 0939242: Thank you for the encouragement
12/02/24, 10:40 am - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Brian, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
12/02/24, 10:47 am - +260 97 0939242: What’s the maximum do students get per month if they work very hard??
12/02/24, 2:51 pm - +260 97 0939242: So that $350 we have to start paying it now?
12/02/24, 2:55 pm - Gurvinder: Please, that will be paid after the student is found eligible for the program.
12/02/24, 2:57 pm - +260 97 0939242: I get it
12/02/24, 2:59 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
12/02/24, 2:59 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
12/02/24, 2:59 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Please come online so that we can continue with the session.
16/02/24, 11:21 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
17/02/24, 9:02 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,
Hope you are doing well,
Please come online so that we can continue with the session

Please come online so that we can continue with the session.
19/02/24, 11:24 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.
20/02/24, 9:26 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,
Hope you are doing well,
Please come online so that we can continue with the session.
