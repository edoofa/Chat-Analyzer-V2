20/02/24, 10:09 am - +27 81 335 6211: Yes correct <This message was edited>
20/02/24, 11:14 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Natalie, also do tell me whether you learnt about Natalie’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
20/02/24, 11:29 am - +27 81 335 6211: I learnt that Edoofa simply means Education For All and the Edoofa  is mainly a centered on giving students higher education that is affordable and is based in India, with the help of it's program through scholarships and internships.
20/02/24, 11:38 am - +27 81 335 6211: From Natalie's Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program l learnt that it indeed equips students with so many skills that they can apply to for a better future that includes specially and economically and l also learnt that Edoofa Program is not just a Program but a family so to say with the help of Counsellors guiding you in every step of the way, it is indeed a wonderful adventure with Edoofa Program
20/02/24, 11:39 am - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
20/02/24, 11:39 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
20/02/24, 11:39 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
20/02/24, 11:39 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
20/02/24, 11:39 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
20/02/24, 11:41 am - +27 81 335 6211: Yes, it is!!
20/02/24, 12:04 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Tadiwa, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
20/02/24, 12:10 pm - +27 81 335 6211: Yes l do
20/02/24, 12:26 pm - Gurvinder: Now Tadiwa, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?

7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations. The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general.

The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor.
*4) Judge*
This role is considered to be very prestigious by any law student. Immediately after the completion of graduation, an individual can appear for a lower judiciary exam.

20/02/24, 3:09 pm - +27 81 335 6211: I would like to be seen as an expert in the legal field that vulnerable people can come for legal advises. I have seen so many great people doing exploits in the legal field and l would love to hold such a position and opportunity in the society, potentially taking on a leadership role in the Law firm and this l believe if l get into Edoofa Program l can get all the help l need that includes emotionally, socially, psychologically and even get employability skills but above all financially so as to achieve this and make this come to pass

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
20/02/24, 3:13 pm - +27 81 335 6211: Yes, I'm wholeheartedly willing because this has always been my passion
20/02/24, 3:14 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
20/02/24, 3:24 pm - +27 81 335 6211: I believe studying abroad gives one more professional opportunities, more developmental skills, a clear understanding of more rights and responsibilities leading to a successful and impactful future career
20/02/24, 3:25 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?

20/02/24, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Tadiwa, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?

20/02/24, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

20/02/24, 3:41 pm - +27 81 335 6211: Yes I'm wondering
20/02/24, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
