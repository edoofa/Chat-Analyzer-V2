29/01/24, 12:16 pm - +260 97 4065906: Goodmorning Mr Govinda,  Chilando has interest in persuing law studies. Does  this programme offer that discipline.
29/01/24, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: Please, we do, but we will come to that ahead in the counselling session, right now please tell me you got to know about the program from Taonga, is that right?
29/01/24, 12:55 pm - +260 776798995: Yes
29/01/24, 1:18 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Taonga, also do tell me whether you learnt about Taonga’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
29/01/24, 3:55 pm - +260 776798995: She told me that edoofa is a scholarship program  initiated by Anhad Edutrain Solutions India. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. It is a scholarship program solves  problems of a lack of affordability and employability in higher education. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life. Edoofians are given  mentors who guide them from the beginning to the end.
29/01/24, 3:55 pm - +260 776798995: I was also told about the EWYL program which stands for earn while you learn.The EWYL  programme is a programme that helps pupils to get the opportunity to learn and enhance their skills.  The program helps to finance pupil's education over the scholarship.
29/01/24, 4:01 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
29/01/24, 4:01 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
29/01/24, 4:01 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
29/01/24, 4:01 pm - +260 776798995: Ok
29/01/24, 4:01 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
29/01/24, 4:01 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
29/01/24, 4:01 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 4:01 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
29/01/24, 4:05 pm - +260 776798995: Yes, ofcourse
29/01/24, 4:16 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Chilando, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
29/01/24, 4:17 pm - +260 776798995: Yes I do
29/01/24, 4:29 pm - Gurvinder: Now Chilando, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?

7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in Grade 12?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

Preferably specialising in company or family law.I believe having taken principals of accounts and commerce in high school gives me an advantage when it comes to company law.Getting into the edoofa program will allow me to complete this course and become any of the options provided.I am also interested in the earn as you learn program which is been offered.I have dreams of opening my own law firm one day and I believe getting accepted into this program would be one step closer to achieving the desired goals.As mentioned earlier I have a passion for this line of work because I want to help others and be part of the people who serve justice.Taking up any of the occupations listed would allow me to do just that .As a lawyer,judge, public persecutor or company secretary.
30/01/24, 3:49 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Chilando I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

30/01/24, 3:52 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
30/01/24, 4:02 pm - +260 776798995: I feel like studying abroad offers a wide range of benefits. First of all, it provides an opportunity to study in prestigious institutions with renowned faculty members and cutting-edge resources. This exposure can help me to enhance my academic knowledge and skills in ways that may not be available in my home country. It can  allow me to explore different teaching methods and approaches, which can broaden my perspective and help me develop a more well-rounded educational background. It also offers the chance to collaborate with students from all over the world, fostering cross-cultural understanding and expanding my network. This Is what I think after interacting with taonga when I asked her about the program. <This message was edited>
30/01/24, 4:06 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
30/01/24, 4:16 pm - +260 776798995: Firstly by encouraging other people to take up this course that is believed to be difficult and to some impossible by beginning an example. Encouraging more people to study abroad and to take advantage of scholarships .Most people are ignorant of the many opportunities that come with scholarships and studying abroad. Becoming an example would help people see  and explore education related opportunities like edoofa
30/01/24, 4:17 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Chilando, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
30/01/24, 4:17 pm - +260 776798995: I agree
30/01/24, 4:18 pm - +260 776798995: And I'm willing to do do just that
30/01/24, 4:18 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
30/01/24, 4:18 pm - +260 776798995: Yes
30/01/24, 4:19 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
30/01/24, 4:19 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

01/02/24, 7:54 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
01/02/24, 12:46 pm - +260 776798995: Good afternoon <This message was edited>
01/02/24, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: Please, you are free to work anywhere you want.
01/02/24, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: Chilando in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!

You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
01/02/24, 12:50 pm - +260 776798995: Thank you
01/02/24, 12:50 pm - +260 776798995: I understand
01/02/24, 12:50 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
01/02/24, 12:54 pm - +260 776798995: No
01/02/24, 12:55 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
01/02/24, 12:55 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
01/02/24, 12:55 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
01/02/24, 12:55 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 12:55 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
01/02/24, 12:57 pm - +260 776798995: Sounds great
01/02/24, 12:57 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
01/02/24, 12:58 pm - +260 776798995: Yes please
01/02/24, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: Chilando, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
01/02/24, 1:07 pm - +260 776798995: Are these jobs in line with the course?
01/02/24, 1:08 pm - Gurvinder: Please all the skills taught in the EWYL program are essential in all the jobs.
01/02/24, 1:12 pm - +260 776798995: Ok
01/02/24, 1:15 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
01/02/24, 1:15 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
01/02/24, 1:15 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*
_How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer!_ by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu*

01/02/24, 1:15 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
01/02/24, 1:23 pm - +260 776798995: Yes I do
01/02/24, 1:27 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Chilando, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
01/02/24, 1:28 pm - +260 776798995: I see
01/02/24, 1:29 pm - +260 776798995: Thank you for that clarification
01/02/24, 1:31 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

01/02/24, 1:31 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
01/02/24, 1:35 pm - +260 776798995: It is
01/02/24, 1:35 pm - +260 776798995: Actually more than what I expected
01/02/24, 1:36 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Chilando, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
01/02/24, 1:36 pm - +260 776798995: That is correct
01/02/24, 1:38 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
01/02/24, 1:40 pm - +260 776798995: We have discussed it
01/02/24, 1:40 pm - +260 776798995: But not in depth
01/02/24, 1:40 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
01/02/24, 1:41 pm - +260 776798995: Yes
01/02/24, 1:41 pm - Gurvinder: Chilando as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
01/02/24, 1:43 pm - +260 776798995: Over 1500 USD
01/02/24, 1:43 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Chilando, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
01/02/24, 1:43 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 1:46 pm - +260 776798995: Okay
01/02/24, 1:49 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
01/02/24, 1:50 pm - +260 776798995: I agree
01/02/24, 1:51 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
01/02/24, 1:51 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).


Phase 3: Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.


The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.

However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
01/02/24, 1:55 pm - +260 776798995: So looking at the fact that my results are out, where do I stand
01/02/24, 1:56 pm - +260 776798995: Or rather what phase
01/02/24, 1:59 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
01/02/24, 1:59 pm - +260 776798995: Yes
01/02/24, 2:00 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 2:00 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Chilando, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zambia itself.
01/02/24, 2:00 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
01/02/24, 2:02 pm - +260 776798995: Yes
01/02/24, 2:06 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
01/02/24, 2:06 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
01/02/24, 2:06 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
01/02/24, 2:06 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
01/02/24, 2:08 pm - +260 776798995: No
01/02/24, 2:10 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
01/02/24, 2:11 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
01/02/24, 2:11 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

07/02/24, 11:43 am - Gurvinder: May I know, why didn't @260974065906 address this.
07/02/24, 11:43 am - +260 776798995: He has been very busy lately
07/02/24, 11:43 am - +260 776798995: It may have slipped his mind
07/02/24, 11:45 am - +260 776798995: However, he wants me to explore other career options
07/02/24, 11:45 am - +260 776798995: As stated here
07/02/24, 11:47 am - +260 97 4065906: Goodmorning how are you. Am juggling work and the chat, my apologies sometimes I amnon the mine
07/02/24, 11:59 am - Gurvinder: I understand @260974065906, can you please share, in which field you want to see your child go in?
07/02/24, 12:12 pm - +260 97 4065906: I would like her to pursue what her heart desires  but something relevant. We had a discussion  concerning law... one school of thought is that she can still do it after.
07/02/24, 12:13 pm - +260 97 4065906: Energy studies, I dont know if she can do metallurgy
07/02/24, 12:15 pm - +260 97 4065906: I would go for physicall metallurgy if she can qualify
07/02/24, 12:16 pm - +260 97 4065906: It should incorporate failure analysis, non destructive testing etc

07/02/24, 12:47 pm - Gurvinder: Chilando, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
07/02/24, 12:50 pm - +260 776798995: Ok so me taking it as science doesn't qualify
07/02/24, 1:04 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.

07/02/24, 1:58 pm - Gurvinder: Studying B.Com (Bachelor of Commerce) can provide a solid foundation for pursuing a career in forensic accounting for several reasons:

Core Accounting Skills: B.Com programs typically cover fundamental accounting principles, financial reporting, auditing, and taxation. These skills are essential for understanding financial data, which is crucial in forensic accounting investigations.

Legal and Regulatory Knowledge: Forensic accountants often work closely with legal professionals and need to understand laws and regulations related to financial practices and fraud. B.Com programs may include courses on business law, which can provide valuable knowledge in this area.

Analytical Skills: B.Com programs emphasize critical thinking, problem-solving, and analytical skills, which are essential for analyzing financial data, detecting irregularities, and uncovering fraudulent activities in forensic accounting.

Ethical Considerations: Ethical standards are paramount in forensic accounting, as professionals must maintain integrity and objectivity while conducting investigations. B.Com programs often include courses on business ethics, which can help students develop a strong ethical foundation.

Professional Certification: Many forensic accountants pursue professional certifications such as Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE) or Certified Forensic Accountant (Cr.FA). A B.Com degree can fulfill the educational requirements for these certifications and provide a pathway for further specialization in forensic accounting.

Overall, while a B.Com degree may not specifically focus on forensic accounting, it provides a comprehensive understanding of accounting principles, legal concepts, and analytical skills that are essential for success in this specialized field.

12/02/24, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
14/02/24, 9:46 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,
I would like you to excuse me for not participating in the session yesterday, as I was under the weather,
Please come online so that we can continue with the session.
14/02/24, 10:56 am - +260 776798995: Good morning
14/02/24, 12:11 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, why this hasn't been addressed yet?
14/02/24, 2:34 pm - +260 97 4065906: Good afternoon.

1. Chilando would like to do Cardio Vascular technology.

2. The country preferred for study is India or if any world class university or college that Edoofa has links with that offers the chosen course.
14/02/24, 2:38 pm - +260 97 4065906: The average price of university in India is circa 5,500 to 7200 rupees

4. The annual price that we are willing to pay is USD 2000.

5. Enrollment fee for Edoofa is ZMW 750.00
14/02/24, 2:46 pm - +260 97 4065906: 6. WHat I know about the Edoofa program. 

Edoofa to my knowledge stands for education for all. It was founded  in India and has spread across Africa to Ghana, Zimbabwe and other African countries.  Anchored on strong business acumen and love for eduction Edoofa strives to make education accessible to all more affordably through scholarships and on training jobs. The model is to find placement for deserving students across Africa who are disadvantaged due to lack of finances, good facilities and employability. The students are taken on to Universities or colleges affiliated with Edoofa and in most cases they are encouraged to work during their stay at University to gain experience and make some money that goes towards paying their tuition and college fees while studying. This reduces the cost of education and gives learners the much needed experience and an edge on the employment market.

I submit.
14/02/24, 3:14 pm - Gurvinder: Please the average cost of education without a scholarship is $6000-8000, and the cost of education with a scholarship is $2000-3000.
14/02/24, 3:15 pm - +260 97 4065906: Thank you I have taken note.

14/02/24, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: Please note that the number of scholarship seats is limited in number, and in case *Chilando* is selected for the scholarship we expect that you are clear and aware of all the details shared during the session along with that you also obey the rules and honour the scholarship terms.
14/02/24, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: In case you do not follow these terms then *Chilando’s* entire scholarship process will go into backlog and you will only be able to apply for the scholarship after 6 months. By then the entire fee structure for the scholarship program may increase*.
14/02/24, 3:19 pm - +260 97 4065906: I understand.
14/02/24, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: Ideally, as you know, the tentative dates are:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the *20th or 21st of February 2024* for $200 and the *20th or 21st of March 2024* for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the *20th or 21st of February 2024*
14/02/24, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
