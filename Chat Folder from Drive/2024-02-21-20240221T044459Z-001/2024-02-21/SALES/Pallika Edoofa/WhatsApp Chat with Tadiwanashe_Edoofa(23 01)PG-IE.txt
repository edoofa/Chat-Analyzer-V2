26/01/24, 9:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/01/24, 9:27 am - +263 77 723 8864: Thank you
26/01/24, 9:28 am - +263 77 723 8864: Happy Republic day to you too
29/01/24, 9:45 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings to you all,
As scheduled, I am here to continue your sessions and evaluate your application.
29/01/24, 10:08 am - +263 77 723 8864: Thankyou
29/01/24, 10:09 am - +263 77 723 8864: Greetings to you too hope you had the best long weekend
29/01/24, 10:17 am - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, Indeed!
29/01/24, 10:18 am - Pallika Edoofa: Continuing the session,  I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
29/01/24, 10:19 am - +263 77 723 8864: No
29/01/24, 10:28 am - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
29/01/24, 10:28 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 10:28 am - Pallika Edoofa: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
29/01/24, 12:24 pm - +263 77 723 8864: Yes I think it is
29/01/24, 12:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
29/01/24, 12:27 pm - +263 77 723 8864: I would love to know
29/01/24, 12:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
29/01/24, 12:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
29/01/24, 12:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
29/01/24, 12:45 pm - +263 77 723 8864: Okay
29/01/24, 12:45 pm - +263 77 723 8864: I understand
29/01/24, 12:46 pm - +263 77 723 8864: And I believe I will benefit from the EWYL program
29/01/24, 1:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.
29/01/24, 1:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 3:34 pm - +263 77 723 8864: Yes I do
29/01/24, 3:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
29/01/24, 3:36 pm - +263 77 723 8864: Higher education and the earn while you learn
29/01/24, 3:36 pm - +263 77 723 8864: Actually..alll for facts about Edoofa are significant
29/01/24, 3:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you have grabbed the whole program very well
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn

29/01/24, 3:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
29/01/24, 3:44 pm - +263 77 723 8864: Soon my name will be on those certificates🤭🤭
29/01/24, 3:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed, Keep up the high spirits, Tadiwanashe!
29/01/24, 3:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please address this too
29/01/24, 3:45 pm - +263 77 723 8864: My parents
29/01/24, 3:45 pm - +263 77 723 8864: Yes
29/01/24, 3:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s understandable,I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
29/01/24, 3:47 pm - +263 77 723 8864: They are quite excited as they have the same dreams as mine
29/01/24, 3:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
29/01/24, 3:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
29/01/24, 3:48 pm - +263 77 723 8864: Yes
29/01/24, 3:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright,  When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
29/01/24, 3:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 3:49 pm - +263 77 723 8864: No please tell me all the requirements
29/01/24, 3:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please go through these!
29/01/24, 3:50 pm - +263 77 723 8864: Thankyou
29/01/24, 3:50 pm - +263 77 723 8864: Yes please
29/01/24, 3:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
29/01/24, 3:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
29/01/24, 3:52 pm - +263 77 723 8864: Okay that's noted
29/01/24, 3:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 3:56 pm - +263 77 723 8864: We're just in stage 1😫
29/01/24, 3:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's right!!
29/01/24, 3:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tadiwanashe, is everything alright? <This message was edited>
29/01/24, 3:58 pm - +263 77 723 8864: Yes everything is alright
29/01/24, 3:58 pm - +263 77 723 8864: Yes but I hope we get past the stage
29/01/24, 3:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
29/01/24, 3:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, 
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you?
29/01/24, 3:59 pm - +263 77 723 8864: Yes
29/01/24, 3:59 pm - +263 77 723 8864: Yes please
29/01/24, 3:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
29/01/24, 4:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
29/01/24, 4:01 pm - +263 77 723 8864: Yes I am
29/01/24, 4:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you have any questions for me now?
29/01/24, 4:05 pm - +263 77 723 8864: Okay the only question I have is how and when do I get enrolled
29/01/24, 4:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tadiwanashe, Please note that as we have successfully crossed Stage 1, so after this, your eligibility check test and interview will take place, and if you successfully clear you will be found eligible.
29/01/24, 4:08 pm - +263 77 723 8864: Okay thank you
29/01/24, 4:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Is there anything you would like me to ask?
29/01/24, 4:09 pm - +263 77 723 8864: If you have any questions then feel free
29/01/24, 4:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I didn't get this, Tadiwanashe!
29/01/24, 4:13 pm - +263 77 723 8864: If you have any questions to ask me you can go ahead
29/01/24, 4:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: No Tadiwanashe!
29/01/24, 4:14 pm - +263 77 723 8864: Okay
29/01/24, 8:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tadiwanashe, we have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
29/01/24, 8:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*

*Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

03/02/24, 3:28 pm - +263 77 723 8864: We discussed as a family and we all think Edoofa is a very great and reliable scholarship and we believe being an Edoofian comes with lots of benefits in as much as it brings a lot of responsibility..but we also agreed that upon getting the chance to be an Edoofian then I will work harder than any other to earn and achieve my goals
05/02/24, 1:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good afternoon Everyone,
I hope that you had a great weekend!
05/02/24, 1:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that!
05/02/24, 1:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Excellent, well it seems that you took your family through the entire conversation which we did during your counseling session! May I know if your family has any questions for me?
05/02/24, 4:37 pm - +263 78 390 0693: We would like to enquire about her security as a girl child as parents
05/02/24, 4:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand the concern, Dear Parent!
05/02/24, 4:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Being a parent, the concern regarding the welfare and personal development of their child is absolutely understandable. 

To give a glimpse, we have a community of more than 2500 Zimbabweans with  300+ associate schools from Zimbabwe with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, and parents, who have been bringing success stories of Edoofians for the past 14+ years due to the kind of foster and care that we provide throughout their course!

With UGC-approved Universities whose degrees are Globally accredited, and which have all security and healthcare facilities including counselling departments, Edoofians are exposed to a conducive environment that motivates them to focus on their career and achieve their dreams. There are Zimbabwean Communities at Every University so no child will feel lonely. Moreover, our Admission Team, EWYL(Earn While You Learn) mentor and counsellor of a student will be available to him/her throughout the course. At any point, if the student or parent needs assistance we will be readily accessible. This is the reason why Edoofa is known as a *Higher Education Concierge!*

The Universities are strict in terms of the welfare of children. Being in Zimbabwe itself, your parents will be able to track the happenings, academic performance, and University details

Are you clear about the same?
06/02/24, 10:37 am - +263 77 723 8864: No they understood everything quite well

06/02/24, 1:42 pm - +263 77 723 8864: 6.well what I understand from the Earn while you learn program is that as a student I can be learning and at the same time paying for my school fees as I can get limitless benefits from this program by working and learning at the same time  which makes it a benefit for me as a student and my guardians as it will reduces the costs of the scholarship..the Earn while you learn program assures an affordable leaving and surviving expense while abroad because it reduces the cost of living... through this Earn While You Learn program has no limied scholarship credits/ benefits depending on the rate of a student's dedication and how hard the student si willing to work to sponsor for their own education therefore reducing the financial pressure on one's family
06/02/24, 1:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You are yet to answer 7 question!
06/02/24, 1:48 pm - +263 77 723 8864: 7yes I am
06/02/24, 1:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Tadiwanashe!
06/02/24, 1:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please note that 

3) The average cost of education in India is $6000-$8000
4_The annual fee after the scholarship is $2000-$3000


Even though, the cost of education through the Edoofa Scholarship ranges from $2000-$3000 per annum, based on your performance in the eligibility check stage and evaluation of our Admissions team, you can be considered for a higher quantum of scholarship which can reduce the costs even below $2000 inclusive of tuition and living.

5) *Enrollment fee*
For all the services and assistance including Applications to Universities, Statement of Purpose, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection and sessions, Earn While You Learn program and training, etc all you have is $350 which can either be paid in two phases($200 in 7 days and remaining within the next 30 days) or together.
06/02/24, 1:59 pm - +263 77 723 8864: Okay Thankyou for the explanation
06/02/24, 1:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You are welcome!
06/02/24, 2:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: @263783900693 @263779349191 you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
06/02/24, 2:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
06/02/24, 2:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*


Please address this using voice notes! @263783900693 @263779349191 <This message was edited>
06/02/24, 2:23 pm - +263 78 390 0693: Yes lam willing to support
06/02/24, 2:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
06/02/24, 2:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
06/02/24, 2:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below
06/02/24, 2:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 2:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope now you know Ideally @263779349191 @263783900693 , the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 13th or 14th of February 2024 for $200 and the 1st or 2nd of March for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the the 13th or 14th of February 2024

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
06/02/24, 4:03 pm - +263 78 390 0693: <Media omitted>
