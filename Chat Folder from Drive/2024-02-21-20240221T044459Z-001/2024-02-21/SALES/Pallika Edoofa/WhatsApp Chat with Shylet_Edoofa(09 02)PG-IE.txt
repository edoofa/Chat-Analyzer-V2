08/02/24, 10:13 pm - +91 84940 72991: Greetings Shylet,


I am *Ms. Pallika*, and I am honored to serve as a Career Counselor at Edoofa. Alongside me, we have *Mr. Piiyush*, The Head of Counseling, and *Mr. Jyotishman*, our Head of Admissions Officer.


We have received your application for the Edoofa scholarship program as referred by *Abigail* from Zimbabwe


As we were flooded with applications earlier, we didn't want to rush your process, so I have managed to reserve a time slot for you at *10:30 PM CAT tomorrow (09/02/2023)*, I would appreciate it if you stay active and connected at the given time for the counseling session so that we can process your application. You can also go through our website( www.edoofa.com ). In case the applicant isn't available, parents can initiate the session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule.

10/02/24, 11:01 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings to you all,
As scheduled, I am here to begin your sessions for the Edoofa Scholarship Program and evaluate your application.

Are you ready to begin?

12/02/24, 9:53 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good afternoon Everyone,
I hope that you had a great weekend!

Are we good to start?
12/02/24, 8:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Hi Shylet, I hope you are in good health.

I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program as we have discussed your application, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put your application on hold temporarily. However please Note by Wednesday, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply  

Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program

19/02/24, 10:19 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good afternoon Everyone,
How have you been?
Kindly excuse for the delay, as I was busy with the Africa Trip.
19/02/24, 6:25 pm - +263 71 410 1178: Okay mam so when will we proceed
20/02/24, 9:53 am - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
20/02/24, 9:54 am - Pallika Edoofa: As per the program protocols, it's essential to have the representation of your parents/guardians or whoever is supporting your education in the group. This ensures that they can follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions they may have. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.


*So, I am making you the group admin, please add your parents/guardians or educational supporters and let me know the names and the relations once done.*
20/02/24, 7:53 pm - +263 71 410 1178: Okay mam let me talk to them
