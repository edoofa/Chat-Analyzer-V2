I was anticipating a response from you. Could you kindly share the reason for your unavailability at the scheduled time? I completely understand that you may have prior commitments. Please inform me so that we can adjust our schedule accordingly.

16/10/23, 9:12 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings to you all,


I am here to begin the session, Shall we begin?
22/10/23, 7:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Hi Tinotenda, I hope you are in good health.

I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program as we have discussed your application, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put your application on hold temporarily. However please Note by DAY, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply  

Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program
