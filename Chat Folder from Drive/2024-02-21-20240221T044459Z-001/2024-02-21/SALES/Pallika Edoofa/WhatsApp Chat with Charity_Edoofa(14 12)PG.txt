How are you doing today?
02/02/24, 9:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Hi Charity, I hope you are in good health.

I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program as we have discussed your application, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put your application on hold temporarily. However please Note by Saturday, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply  

Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program

05/02/24, 2:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Charity, I would make a request on your behalf!
05/02/24, 2:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: please note that we currently have a high volume of applicants participating in one-on-one counseling sessions, and there is a queue of individuals awaiting their turn. However, as we have a limited number of available seats, it is crucial for you to actively engage in the session and follow through with the necessary steps to secure your spot.
05/02/24, 3:26 pm - +263 78 773 9312: Okay I will follow
05/02/24, 3:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As per the program protocols, it's essential to have the representation of your parents/guardians or whoever is supporting your education in the group. This ensures that they can follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions they may have. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.

*So, I am making you the group admin, please add your parents/guardians or educational supporters and let me know the names and the relations once done.*
