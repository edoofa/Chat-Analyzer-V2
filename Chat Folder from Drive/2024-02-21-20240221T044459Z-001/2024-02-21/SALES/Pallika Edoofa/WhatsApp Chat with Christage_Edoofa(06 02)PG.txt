08/02/24, 10:10 am - Pallika Edoofa: Christage, I would like to know if you are interested in Biomedical engineering so, why haven't you opted for Physics, chemistry, or mathematics in your A level?
08/02/24, 10:19 am - +263 78 783 1944: Before I went for my Alevel I researched about the required subjects to pursue biomedical engineering from local Universities and l got to know that I could pursue it with Biology, Geography, Agriculture, Nutrition and other subjects
So I then made an analysis of the subjects that I performed higher in Olevel being Geography and Agriculture so I simply choose to do geography, Agriculture and biology because for my Olevel I had Grade C passes in chemistry and physics whilst I had grade B passes in Geography and the other subjects I did for Alevel
08/02/24, 10:35 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Christage, Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
08/02/24, 10:37 am - +263 78 783 1944: Okay I understand
08/02/24, 10:42 am - Pallika Edoofa: So, Christage, I have seen that you have opted Geography, and you did well in it, May I know if your are having interest in it too?
08/02/24, 10:49 am - +263 78 783 1944: Yes I am
08/02/24, 11:03 am - Pallika Edoofa: So, Christage, Being your counselor, I would suggest you go with Geography as for biomedical engineering you are not having the required subject combination, and grades in Biology are also low!
08/02/24, 11:03 am - Pallika Edoofa: So, you are also having interest in Geography, 

So, Shall I explain the *BA. Geography* in depth?
08/02/24, 11:04 am - +263 78 783 1944: Okay thank you I understand
08/02/24, 11:04 am - +263 78 783 1944: Yes please do

Having a supportive community to guide you towards your goals can indeed be invaluable. Quality education and the assurance of achieving your career aspirations are important factors in any educational journey, and it's great to hear that you feel confident in your choice.
08/02/24, 11:54 am - +263 78 783 1944: Yes thank you
08/02/24, 11:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: Christage, Please note that When considering between becoming an Agriculture Specialist and a Geographer, it's essential to weigh the requirements and advantages of each path. While both fields offer unique opportunities, pursuing a career in geography might be particularly advantageous if you excel in it.

Becoming an Agriculture Specialist typically requires a solid foundation in biology and physics, in addition to specialized knowledge in agricultural practices. This path often involves a deep understanding of plant and soil sciences, as well as technical skills related to farming methods and agricultural technology.

On the other hand, opting for a BA in Geography can offer several distinct advantages. Geography encompasses a wide range of subjects, including physical geography (studying natural phenomena like climate and landforms), human geography (exploring topics such as population distribution and urbanization), and geographic information systems (GIS), among others.

Here are some advantages of pursuing a BA in Geography:

Interdisciplinary Approach: Geography incorporates elements of various disciplines, including environmental science, sociology, economics, and political science. This interdisciplinary approach provides a holistic understanding of the world and its complex systems.

Analytical Skills: Geography fosters critical thinking and analytical skills by examining spatial patterns, relationships, and processes. These skills are highly transferable and applicable across different industries and professions.

Versatility: A degree in geography opens doors to diverse career paths. Graduates can work in fields such as urban planning, environmental conservation, market research, GIS analysis, international development, and more.

Fieldwork and Practical Experience: Many geography programs offer opportunities for fieldwork, research projects, and internships. These hands-on experiences provide valuable practical skills and real-world exposure, enhancing your employability.

Global Perspective: Geography encourages an understanding of global interconnectedness and cultural diversity. Studying geography equips you with insights into global challenges, such as climate change, migration, and sustainable development, and prepares you to address them effectively.

Ultimately, choosing between Agriculture Specialist and Geographer depends on your interests, skills, and career goals. If you're drawn to the diverse and dynamic nature of geography and enjoy analyzing spatial patterns and phenomena, pursuing a BA in Geography could be a fulfilling and rewarding path to consider.

08/02/24, 12:48 pm - +263 78 783 1944: Through the research and innovation opportunities we would be able to work with expects helping us have a better understanding of what we are doing as we would be gaining information from someone who is already in that line of work and that being a positive impact on my career

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
08/02/24, 12:51 pm - +263 78 783 1944: Also Indian universities offer quality education and research and this makes me assured that I would be putting my future in the hands of capable people who can lead me to where l want to be
08/02/24, 12:52 pm - +263 78 783 1944: No not really
08/02/24, 12:54 pm - +263 78 783 1944: Around $15 000 and above
08/02/24, 12:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

08/02/24, 1:38 pm - +263 78 783 1944: I'm sure we can work it through
08/02/24, 1:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
08/02/24, 1:39 pm - +263 78 783 1944: No please explain
08/02/24, 1:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
08/02/24, 1:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
08/02/24, 1:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
08/02/24, 1:58 pm - +263 78 783 1944: Yes you can gain experience and also reduce the load on the parents
08/02/24, 2:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 2:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.
08/02/24, 2:05 pm - +263 78 783 1944: I see
08/02/24, 2:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
08/02/24, 2:17 pm - +263 78 783 1944: I think it's between 1.and 4
08/02/24, 2:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education and guidance.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

08/02/24, 2:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
08/02/24, 2:36 pm - +263 78 783 1944: My mother
08/02/24, 2:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s understandable,I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
08/02/24, 2:42 pm - +263 78 783 1944: They are a bit concerned because I would be new to the place and its also far
08/02/24, 2:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Christage, I completely understand your concerns about studying abroad—it's a big step to take, and being in a new place far from home can feel overwhelming at first. However, I want you to know that embarking on this journey is also incredibly exciting and full of opportunities for personal growth and discovery.

While it's natural to feel nervous about the unknown, try to focus on the positive aspects of this experience. You'll have the chance to immerse yourself in a different culture, meet new people from around the world, and broaden your perspectives in ways that wouldn't be possible otherwise. Yes, it might be far from what you're used to, but think of it as an adventure waiting to unfold.
08/02/24, 7:24 pm - +263 78 783 1944: Yes I surely will
08/02/24, 7:24 pm - +263 78 783 1944: Thank you so much
08/02/24, 8:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 9:43 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good Morning,

*“If there is no struggle, there is no progress.” —Frederick Douglass*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
09/02/24, 9:45 am - +263 78 783 1944: Good morning to you too
09/02/24, 9:45 am - +263 78 783 1944: Yes we are ready
09/02/24, 10:10 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's great!
09/02/24, 10:10 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that you are doing well too
09/02/24, 10:13 am - +263 78 783 1944: Yes we are
09/02/24, 10:18 am - Pallika Edoofa: Great!
09/02/24, 10:19 am - Pallika Edoofa: So, Christage,  *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
09/02/24, 10:23 am - +263 78 783 1944: No these are all that I know
09/02/24, 10:33 am - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
09/02/24, 10:33 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 10:37 am - +263 78 783 1944: Yes please do
09/02/24, 10:39 am - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, Let me tell you *why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
09/02/24, 10:40 am - Pallika Edoofa: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
09/02/24, 10:40 am - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
09/02/24, 10:42 am - +263 78 783 1944: Okay understood
09/02/24, 10:43 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 10:44 am - +263 78 783 1944: We are on stage 2
09/02/24, 10:45 am - Pallika Edoofa: Well, Christage,
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you?
09/02/24, 10:46 am - +263 78 783 1944: Okay okay sorry
09/02/24, 10:46 am - +263 78 783 1944: Yes please continue
09/02/24, 10:51 am - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
09/02/24, 10:51 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
09/02/24, 10:51 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
09/02/24, 10:56 am - +263 78 783 1944: Yes I am
09/02/24, 10:57 am - Pallika Edoofa: Do you have any queries?
09/02/24, 11:00 am - +263 78 783 1944: Just to confirm after admission you are saying that I'm given several Universities to choose from and the admission team also helps choose the most suitable one?
09/02/24, 11:00 am - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, Christage, our Admission Team will be guiding you for the same
09/02/24, 11:01 am - +263 78 783 1944: Okay I'm clear now
09/02/24, 11:04 am - Pallika Edoofa: Is there anything else you would like to know?
09/02/24, 11:04 am - +263 78 783 1944: For now I think I'm clear on everything
09/02/24, 11:54 am - Pallika Edoofa: Christage, we have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
09/02/24, 11:54 am - Pallika Edoofa: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*

*Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

10/02/24, 1:05 pm - +263 78 783 1944: Yes I did and they had a few questions so I was hoping to ask you today during the session <This message was edited>
10/02/24, 1:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, please ask!
10/02/24, 1:07 pm - +263 78 783 1944: So the first one was that is every graduate guaranteed an internships
10/02/24, 1:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, in India, every graduate is guaranteed an internship, provided they demonstrate hard work and potential for future success.
10/02/24, 1:15 pm - +263 78 783 1944: Okay okay
And my mom was also concerned about the employment demand for people with the type of degree I am going to pursue and whether or not it is really the best choice
10/02/24, 1:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Christage, Your mom's concern about the employment demand for a Bachelor of Arts in Geography is valid. While Geography offers a diverse range of career paths, including urban planning, environmental consulting, GIS analysis, and teaching, it's important to acknowledge that the job market can vary based on factors such as location, industry demand, and individual skills and experiences. Researching specific job opportunities in your area of interest and considering potential career paths within Geography can help address her concerns. Additionally, exploring internships, networking opportunities, and further education or certification can enhance your prospects and ensure that pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Geography aligns with your long-term goals and interests. <This message was edited>
10/02/24, 1:37 pm - +263 78 783 1944: Okay thank you
10/02/24, 1:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, Christage, Is there anything else you would like to ask?
10/02/24, 1:39 pm - +263 78 783 1944: Nop it's okay
Most questions evolved around that
10/02/24, 1:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's great!

May I know the thoughts and opinions of your family regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
10/02/24, 1:43 pm - +263 77 319 9727: Good afternoon everyone
10/02/24, 1:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good afternoon Ms. Mwanuka,
How are you doing today?
10/02/24, 1:44 pm - +263 77 319 9727: Am good and you
10/02/24, 1:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am also doing well
10/02/24, 1:45 pm - +263 77 319 9727: Been following the conversation at least my questions are clarified
10/02/24, 1:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Do you have any queries?
10/02/24, 1:47 pm - +263 77 319 9727: Everything is cleared am satisfied
10/02/24, 1:58 pm - +263 78 783 1944: Since my mom is currently unemployed they said that  the fees may be an issue but they would try to work it out <This message was edited>
10/02/24, 1:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Christage, I do understand the challenges, did you manage to compare the cost of education in Zimbabwe with that through the Edoofa Scholarship Program?
10/02/24, 1:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You see, Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months last year and let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
10/02/24, 1:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self-sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program. We also ensure they develop employability skills so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate. I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?
10/02/24, 2:01 pm - +263 78 783 1944: Yes I truly am
10/02/24, 2:04 pm - +263 77 319 9727: I will try my best to pay fees l want my daughter to get quality education
10/02/24, 2:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I appreciate your efforts for your child's future!
10/02/24, 2:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/02/24, 2:14 pm - +263 78 783 1944: This message was deleted
10/02/24, 2:16 pm - +263 78 783 1944: And I hope I can do the same
10/02/24, 2:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed, Christage, 
Don't lose hope, if they can, you can also!
10/02/24, 2:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Blessing, Before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me?

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
10/02/24, 2:43 pm - +263 78 783 1944: 1. Bachelor of Arts in Geography

2. India

3.$6000-$8000

4.$2000-$3000

5.The enrollment fee is $350
$200 is to be paid in 7days and you are then given 30days more to pay the remaining $150

6.The Earn While You Learn program is a program in which Edoofa has linked with some brands and companies in order to hire Edoofian. During the program students are given real time online projects in which they can gain experience and earn scholarship credits depending on their performance in which is equivalent to physical cash which they can use to pay a significant part of their fees. It also helps students develop skills which can be used in workspace environments. The program basically helps in the growth and development of a student  leading them to their goals

7. Yes I am
10/02/24, 2:47 pm - +263 77 319 9727: May u clarify on number 2/3
It's 6000-8000 per the whole course or per year 
And the 2000-3000  is for ....
10/02/24, 2:48 pm - +263 78 783 1944: 6000-8000 without a scholarship

But if you have a scholarship it reduces to 2000-3000

10/02/24, 3:06 pm - +263 77 319 9727: Ok
10/02/24, 8:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Monica, I hope that you are well understood now!
10/02/24, 8:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: May I know is there anything else you would like to ask?
10/02/24, 8:32 pm - +263 78 783 1944: No we are all clear now thank you
10/02/24, 8:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
10/02/24, 8:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: @263789421338 @263773199727 you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
10/02/24, 8:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
10/02/24, 8:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*

10/02/24, 8:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This message was deleted
10/02/24, 8:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
10/02/24, 8:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
10/02/24, 8:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below
10/02/24, 8:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/02/24, 8:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope now you know Ideally, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 17th or 18th of February 2024 for $200 and the 17th or 18th of March for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 17th or 18th of February 2024

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
10/02/24, 9:01 pm - +263 77 319 9727: I have to say I will opt for 1 however at the moment I am not so financially stable
10/02/24, 9:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for the acknowledgement, dear parent!
It has been duly noted and we appreciate your support for your child's career
