This ensures that they can follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions they may have. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.

*So, I am making you the group admin. I see one of your parents is already a part of the group. Please add other parent/guardians or educational supporters and let me know the names and the relations once done. Let me know if there is any challenge.*

05/02/24, 2:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you will be intrigued for Anesu to study in India
05/02/24, 2:49 pm - +263 71 823 0014: Yes
05/02/24, 3:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Welcome to the session, Anesu,
How have you been?
05/02/24, 3:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That is amazing, As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
05/02/24, 3:06 pm - +263 71 823 0014: Yes lm familier
05/02/24, 3:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
05/02/24, 3:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 3:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
05/02/24, 3:15 pm - +263 71 823 0014: Yes
05/02/24, 3:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
05/02/24, 3:27 pm - +263 71 823 0014: I'm not sure
05/02/24, 3:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
05/02/24, 3:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
05/02/24, 3:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
05/02/24, 3:29 pm - +263 77 351 8121: No,she does'nt know how it is done
05/02/24, 3:30 pm - +263 71 823 0014: Well understood thank
05/02/24, 3:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please go through this once!
05/02/24, 3:34 pm - +263 71 823 0014: Yes l think l will be benefiting much
05/02/24, 3:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 3:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.
05/02/24, 3:41 pm - +263 71 823 0014: Oooooky olky
05/02/24, 3:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
05/02/24, 3:58 pm - +263 71 823 0014: Expert career counseling
05/02/24, 3:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education and guidance.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

05/02/24, 3:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
05/02/24, 4:01 pm - +263 71 823 0014: My parents
05/02/24, 4:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s understandable,I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
05/02/24, 4:17 pm - +263 71 823 0014: My family...... they have no issues with that
05/02/24, 4:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
05/02/24, 4:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
05/02/24, 4:45 pm - +263 71 823 0014: Nooo   what are the other requirements
05/02/24, 4:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
05/02/24, 4:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 5:06 pm - +263 71 823 0014: Yes
05/02/24, 5:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
05/02/24, 5:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.

The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
05/02/24, 5:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
05/02/24, 5:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
05/02/24, 5:28 pm - +263 71 823 0014: Olky understood
05/02/24, 5:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's great!
05/02/24, 5:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 7:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Anesu, Are we connected?
05/02/24, 8:01 pm - +263 71 823 0014: Yes we are connected
05/02/24, 8:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please address this
05/02/24, 8:13 pm - +263 71 823 0014: Stage 1
05/02/24, 8:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, 
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you?
05/02/24, 8:29 pm - +263 71 823 0014: Yes u may
05/02/24, 8:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
05/02/24, 8:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
05/02/24, 8:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6 :* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
05/02/24, 8:32 pm - +263 71 823 0014: Yes clear now

Accounting is a common specialization within B.Com programs, and many universities offer a range of accounting courses to students enrolled in this degree. These courses will provide you with a solid foundation in accounting principles, financial reporting, auditing, taxation, and other related topics.

08/02/24, 2:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, let me know once done!
08/02/24, 3:29 pm - +263 71 823 0014: The earn while learn program is the backbone of the edoofa program.... It is when students are allowed and given time of online projects  during which they gain excellent work experience.. And earn scholarship credits based on students performance.   These can be used to pay off a significant part of the students higher educational fees  and this makes  their university education more  affordable .  This program helps students too to gain and develop the skills necessary for digital workspace environment  and also digital marketing among others lastly this program helps growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up the changhin marketing strategies
08/02/24, 3:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Anesu!
08/02/24, 3:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: @263777276261 @263773518121 @263785234410 you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
08/02/24, 3:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
08/02/24, 3:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*


Please address this using voice notes!
08/02/24, 3:52 pm - +263 77 351 8121: Good afternoon,sorry was busy at work so couldnt be with since you started the session today,if its possible could you please furnish us with the  total amount that we are supposed to pay for our daughter's higher education fees in India's uneversities,that will help us to have a clear budget and see if the figures are affordable considering our low earnings here in Zimbabwe.
08/02/24, 3:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Welcome to the session, Dear parent!
I hope that you are doing well
08/02/24, 3:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Let me help you with this, please!
08/02/24, 3:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 3:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Referring to this image let me re-explain the financial aspect of the program in 3 parts.

1. The Enrollment fee is $350 which includes application forms, statement of purpose, letter of recommendation, visa assistance, Earn While You Learn Program's training etc.

2. The Registration fee would be between $500-$1000, basically if you recall I did brief you after your university interaction with multiple universities, you would have to reserve your seat in 1 particular university you would have to pay a registration fee. Now usually Registration fee for a student is a separate expense altogether, however for an Edoofian it is considered a part of the first year's annual fee.

Say suppose, after the scholarship your fee is $2200, and you are being asked to pay $500 as a registration fee.

Now, being an Edoofa Applicant you have the privilege here of the registration fee being adjusted against your Tuition fee.

Hence the amount of $500 paid as registration fee will be waived off from your Fee and after that, the balance of ($2200-$500=$1700) has to be paid after coming to India in August/September of the year you come in 2 installments. The first part will be $1000 which you will pay in August 2024-25 and the remaining $700 in January 2025-26.

3. The Annual fee after the scholarship as discussed above would be between $2000-$3000, and this would include Accommodation, Food Expenses, and Basic University Expenses such as exam fees, Library Fee, and Lab Fee However if a student is able to clear the Eligibility Check test and Interview with over 90 marks, a student is eligible to get a 90% to 100% scholarship where the Annual fee after the scholarship would be between $1250-$1500, which would include Accommodation, Food Expenses, and Basic University Expenses such as exam fees, Library Fee, and Lab Fee
08/02/24, 3:59 pm - +263 77 351 8121: Yes i am doing very well
08/02/24, 3:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad to know that!
08/02/24, 4:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please go through this
08/02/24, 4:11 pm - +263 77 351 8121: Have gone through it,understood,thank you for ellaborating
08/02/24, 4:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You are most welcome Dear Parent!
08/02/24, 4:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please go through this too @263773518121
08/02/24, 4:43 pm - +263 77 351 8121: Yes as a family we are very much willing to support our child to the best of our cspability
08/02/24, 6:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need
08/02/24, 6:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
08/02/24, 6:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below
08/02/24, 6:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 6:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope now you know Ideally, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 15th or 16th of February 2024 for $200 and the 15th or 16th of March for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 15th or 16th of February 2024

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
08/02/24, 6:52 pm - +263 77 351 8121: If my child is found eligible i would prefer a payment plan system of $200 and $150 by mid March
08/02/24, 6:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Thank you for the acknowledgement, dear parent!
It has been duly noted and we appreciate your support for your child's career

09/02/24, 9:03 am - +263 77 351 8121: You are most welcome
09/02/24, 9:37 am - Pallika Edoofa: Also, Anesu, 
Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
09/02/24, 10:17 am - +263 71 823 0014: Yes sir

16/02/24, 9:16 am - +263 77 351 8121: Very informative and encouraging indeed,thank you for sharing the video👏👏
16/02/24, 9:25 am - Pallika Edoofa: You are most welcome, Mr. Dhilwayo!
16/02/24, 9:41 am - +263 77 351 8121: Thank you ,we will use Mr Jerera's FBC Bank account number for payment of fees
16/02/24, 9:42 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Are you clear with that mode?
16/02/24, 9:44 am - +263 77 351 8121: You can ellaborate more for more clarity
16/02/24, 9:48 am - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, Mr. Dhilwayo!
16/02/24, 9:50 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Let me help you with the modes of enrollment fee payment
Mode 1) Direct Transaction Through The Bank
You can transfer payment from your bank account directly to our Organization's account using this banking details.
*Swift code*:AXISINBB207
*IFSC code*:UTIB0001147
*Account Name*:Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd.
*Current Account Number* 917020070183626
*Bank's Name*: Axis Bank Ltd.
*Bank’s Address*: Janakpuri, B Block, Neww Delhi[DL]
Ground Floor & Basement, B-1/503, Janakpuri, New Delhi 110058
*But the transaction charges vary from $50 to above because it is an international transaction, you also need a foreign Currency Account and that is why, the second mode is recommended*
16/02/24, 9:50 am - Pallika Edoofa: Mode 2: Through our associate in Zimbabwe
16/02/24, 9:50 am - Pallika Edoofa: Mr Charles Jerera is a well-known Educationalist from Zimbabwe who is also our associate and has worked with Ministries, Stakeholders and Institutions. He had worked over 4 years in Masvingo Province and a total of 20+ years in Zimbabwe under the Ministry of Education, as a District Officer, and a cultural Officer, with the Ministry of Local Government and has retired from the Ministry of Sports, Arts and Recreation. His son is an Edoofian and arrived in India on 16th August last year

For the entire $350 the necessary amount including the transfer charges would be 12.5% of the payable amount and the process would be similar, you would be visiting the bank branch and depositing the fee in his account, the same details are as below:-
*Bank:* FBC
*Account Holder's Name:* Charles Jerera
*Account Number:* 5333 0380 1404 8828
*Swift Code:* FBCPZWHA
*Branch:* Masvingo
*Contact Number:* +263 77 376 9854

*You can also use PayPal or Payment mode on our website(10% transfer charges) if you have an international credit card or debit card to pay directly to our organization's bank account. This would be a direct mode of transaction*
16/02/24, 9:50 am - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.
So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-
BANK NAME: FBC
SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA
ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA
ACC NUMBER: 5333038014048828
CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854
16/02/24, 10:01 am - +263 77 351 8121: Thank you for that ellaboration,its now very clear and its also cost effective to pay through Mr Charles Jerera's account number,once agai n thank you for sharing that information

16/02/24, 10:50 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mr. Dhilwayo, That is well noted!
16/02/24, 11:16 am - +263 77 351 8121: Thank you
