19/02/24, 11:52 am - Pallika Edoofa: I understand your aspirations to pursue a career in Radiography and Aviation, and it's clear that you're passionate about these fields. However, based on your current subject combination, it appears that you might not have Chemistry and Biology in your academic background. These subjects are often prerequisites for programs related to Radiography and certain branches of Aviation.
19/02/24, 11:55 am - +263 78 144 5797: Radiography and some branches of avaition ,can you assist me with the available program on these
19/02/24, 12:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Before that, Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
19/02/24, 12:08 pm - +263 78 144 5797: Oky oky so l can venture in engineering as per my subjects
19/02/24, 12:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Aldridge, Please note that for engineering courses, you will need Chemistry too, but as you haven't opted that in your A level, so, you are not eligible for the same!
19/02/24, 12:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: The only Engineering you will be able to pursue is 

*B.Tech. Computer Science Engineering*

19/02/24, 1:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know that!
19/02/24, 1:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you will be intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India have a positive impact on your career and help you achieve your goals?

19/02/24, 1:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely, the expertise of faculty members and industry professionals enhances learning, while global recognition elevates certificate reputation. Moreover, the English-speaking environment fosters enjoyable interactions among students from diverse backgrounds, enriching the overall learning experience.
19/02/24, 1:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also,  I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
19/02/24, 1:42 pm - +263 78 144 5797: l only heard that it's cost without a scholarship
19/02/24, 1:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
19/02/24, 1:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/02/24, 1:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
19/02/24, 1:48 pm - +263 78 144 5797: Very affordable sir
19/02/24, 1:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
19/02/24, 1:50 pm - +263 78 144 5797: No ,can assist
19/02/24, 1:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
19/02/24, 1:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
19/02/24, 1:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
19/02/24, 1:55 pm - +263 78 144 5797: Sure on the first video you posted l heard of earn while you learn,it a beneficial thing to students,l l can recommend edoofa as the greatest amongs others big thumbs up
19/02/24, 1:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am so glad to hear these kind words!
19/02/24, 1:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.
19/02/24, 1:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/02/24, 2:02 pm - +263 78 144 5797: How is Edoofa for me, can't wait for a great opportunity with EDOOFA PROVIDING SUCK HELPFUL ASSURANCES
19/02/24, 2:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that!
19/02/24, 2:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Now, as we are proceeding towards the end, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
19/02/24, 2:07 pm - +263 78 144 5797: 3 made edoofa an outstanding scholarship, because most scholarships don't offer such ,in their doing, now l believe in the unseen of edoofa plans for me which will manifest as soon as possible
19/02/24, 2:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and employability.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

19/02/24, 2:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
19/02/24, 2:11 pm - +263 78 144 5797: My parents and l have put on the budget that if it all goes well they can afford,l can say apologies that they are reading it from my phone and are giving some direction and understand edoofa more
19/02/24, 2:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s understandable,I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
19/02/24, 2:16 pm - +263 78 144 5797: They are satisfied with it as it seems straight forward and stability interms of it's offers and affordable as per their budget,they are quite happy that l will explore the limits of learning in a foreign country and adventuring with many people, culture, teachers and even places they will be proud of me if l get this opportunity as an edoofa student
19/02/24, 2:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Aldridge, 
It's wonderful to hear that you are satisfied with the opportunities and affordability of the program you're considering. Pursuing education abroad is indeed an exciting adventure that offers the chance to explore new cultures, interact with diverse individuals, and broaden your horizons. Your family's pride in your pursuit of this opportunity is truly heartwarming, and their support will undoubtedly fuel your success as an EdooFa student. Embrace this journey with enthusiasm and determination, and you'll undoubtedly make the most of every moment, both academically and personally.
19/02/24, 2:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also,  *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
19/02/24, 2:23 pm - +263 78 144 5797: How can l apply for these
19/02/24, 2:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Don't worry, Our admissions Team will be guiding you for the same!
19/02/24, 2:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
19/02/24, 2:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/02/24, 2:35 pm - +263 78 144 5797: Yes
19/02/24, 2:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright Let me tell *you why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
19/02/24, 2:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
19/02/24, 2:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
19/02/24, 2:38 pm - +263 78 144 5797: When is this payed
19/02/24, 2:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I will be guiding you further!
19/02/24, 2:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/02/24, 2:52 pm - +263 78 144 5797: Thanks you sir so what l am l required to do next
19/02/24, 3:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please address this

19/02/24, 3:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Aldridge, I think you didn't get what I am asking!
19/02/24, 3:09 pm - +263 78 144 5797: Sure sir can you assist
19/02/24, 3:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me on which particular stage are we.
19/02/24, 3:15 pm - +263 78 144 5797: l think 2 sir
19/02/24, 3:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, Aldridge,
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you?
19/02/24, 3:17 pm - +263 78 144 5797: Yes sir
19/02/24, 3:17 pm - +263 78 144 5797: Now l understand sorry for the confusion
19/02/24, 3:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
19/02/24, 3:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
19/02/24, 3:25 pm - +263 78 144 5797: Sure sir all clear
19/02/24, 3:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you have any queries?
19/02/24, 3:29 pm - +263 78 144 5797: Not yet sir satisfied with the steps as for now
19/02/24, 3:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
19/02/24, 3:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Aldridge, we have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
