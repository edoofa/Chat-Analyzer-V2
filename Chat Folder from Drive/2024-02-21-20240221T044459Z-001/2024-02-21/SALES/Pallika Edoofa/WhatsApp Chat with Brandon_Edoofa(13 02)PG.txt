I am Ms. Pallika, a career counselor at Edoofa and we have with us, Mr. Piiyush, The head of Counseling, and  Mr. Jyotishman, Head of Admission at Edoofa


We have received the application of Simango for the Edoofa scholarship program and I will be taking you all forward through the counseling session to discuss and evaluate your application. Let me know once you are available!
13/02/24, 1:11 pm - +27 67 113 3695: Thank you for having me here, you can proceed <This message was edited>
13/02/24, 1:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As per the program protocols, it's essential to have the representation of students/parents or whoever is supporting the child’s education in the group. This ensures that you follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions that arise. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.

*So, I am making you the group admin. Please add Brandon and His mom to the group. Let me know if there is any challenge.*
13/02/24, 1:14 pm - +27 67 113 3695: Thank you
13/02/24, 1:15 pm - +27 67 113 3695: What are the requirements for this scholarship

13/02/24, 1:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Welcome to the session, Brandon,
How are you doing? <This message was edited>
13/02/24, 1:50 pm - +263 78 008 4080: I'm doing well and you Ms Pallika
13/02/24, 1:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am also doing well
13/02/24, 1:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That is well noted, Ms. Nyarai
13/02/24, 1:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please note that Edoofa is a partially funded scholarship program! 

The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extracurricular Activities

So the universities will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of the scholarship
13/02/24, 2:04 pm - +27 67 113 3695: So this simply means it's not a fully funded program
13/02/24, 2:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, Ms. Nyarai, Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.
13/02/24, 2:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, Students can get the opportunity *_to earn while you learn_*, as they get to work on real-time projects by which they will earn scholarship credits worth 50-100$ or more a month which will help to reduce their tuition fees!

I am in a family of nine children; six boys and three girls and I'm the first born. My siblings are going to school except two. One is form 4 the other is form 2. Some of them are still Primary students, 2 in grade 6, one is grade 4 and the last one is grade 2.I studied my primary education at Birchenough Bridge Primary school from 2009 to 2017 where we used to pay $20 per term. I then went to Devuli secondary school for my secondary education from 2018 to 2021 where we used to pay $40 per term. I completed my O level very well and passed 8 subjects. I then transferred to St Patrick's High for my advanced level from 2022 to 2023 and the fees was $170 per term. I was studying Pure Mathematics, Physics, Computer science and Biology then got 14 points. I am a person with several strengths such as fast learner, Honesty, flexibility, teamwork, problem solver, discipline, creative and communicative. I sometimes experience these weaknesses of me ; irritable and self criticism. I came from a low income family but I don't want my dreams to study Pharmacy abroad to be overshaded by my background and I think we Edoofa my dreams will come true.

Then I started to look for a scholarship to fulfil my career goals so that it can be an encouragement to my friends and village partners to work hard in their education.

20/02/24, 1:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Brandon, So, if you are interested in Medical Field, so why haven't you opted for Chemistry in your A level?
20/02/24, 1:16 pm - +263 78 008 4080: I was studying Chemistry since o level. During my A level, I did Chemistry for a short period and we unexpectedly loose our teacher , he transferred to another school And the replacement takes long until I take up Physics.
20/02/24, 1:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
20/02/24, 1:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since you do not have Chemistry, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine and Pharmacy, but considering your interest there are better courses from the Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help fulfill your dreams of working in this field
