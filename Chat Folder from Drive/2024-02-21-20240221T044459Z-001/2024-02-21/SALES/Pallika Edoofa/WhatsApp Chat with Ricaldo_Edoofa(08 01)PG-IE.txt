The syllabus of the course may vary from college to college, however, the structure and topics covered, remain the same.

30/01/24, 9:31 pm - +263 78 954 8624: Oky starting from 10am up to 4pm I will be free
31/01/24, 8:05 am - +263 78 954 8624: Mrng
31/01/24, 8:50 am - +263 78 954 8624: The think is that I would like to be enrolled at your school as a scholarship student not as a international student if it is possible because it is way too cost being an international student rather than being a scholarship student and I don't think my parents can afford to take the risk of an international student at your school
31/01/24, 9:43 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings everyone,
How are you doing today?
31/01/24, 10:29 am - +263 78 954 8624: Great and you
31/01/24, 10:44 am - Pallika Edoofa: I am also doing well today, Thank you for asking!
31/01/24, 10:45 am - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
31/01/24, 10:45 am - Pallika Edoofa: This message was deleted
31/01/24, 10:45 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 10:45 am - Pallika Edoofa: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
31/01/24, 12:06 pm - +263 78 954 8624: Yes I think going for the scholarship student my family can afford that also it will be my pleasure doing my course at one of the top rated schools in India
31/01/24, 12:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
31/01/24, 12:10 pm - +263 78 954 8624: No I don't mam
31/01/24, 12:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
31/01/24, 12:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
31/01/24, 12:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
31/01/24, 4:28 pm - +263 78 954 8624: Yeah a lot because I will gaining experience as I will be working with some of the most experienced people and also EWYP will be so beneficial to me especially to my department of business as I will gain skills, weakness and strength in business
31/01/24, 4:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 4:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.
31/01/24, 4:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since it is past my office hours, Let us connect at *09:30 am CAT (01/02/2024)* to resume your session (In case you have any challenges, please let me know the time you will be available, and we will schedule accordingly)

*In case the student is having lessons, the parents can also take part in the session*

01/02/24, 9:36 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,
I am here to begin the session,
Are you ready for the same?
01/02/24, 10:56 am - +263 78 954 8624: Yes I'm ready
01/02/24, 11:24 am - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing today, Ricaldo?
01/02/24, 11:24 am - Pallika Edoofa: Let's end our counseling session today with 10-20 minutes!
01/02/24, 11:24 am - Pallika Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
01/02/24, 11:58 am - +263 78 954 8624: I'm fine and you
01/02/24, 12:01 pm - +263 78 954 8624: Yeah I will go for number 4
01/02/24, 12:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education, services and guidance
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

01/02/24, 12:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
01/02/24, 12:33 pm - +263 78 954 8624: My parents
01/02/24, 12:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s understandable,I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
01/02/24, 2:44 pm - +263 78 954 8624: Sorry for the delay reply the think is there is some network issues
01/02/24, 2:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, I understand!
01/02/24, 2:49 pm - +263 78 954 8624: Oky there are so happy about me studying abroad and they are willing to do what it takes for my future career goals
01/02/24, 2:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
01/02/24, 2:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
01/02/24, 3:05 pm - +263 78 954 8624: Wow I can't wait to be a self employed person and able to look after my parents
01/02/24, 3:06 pm - +263 78 954 8624: No I don't
01/02/24, 3:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
01/02/24, 3:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 3:19 pm - +263 78 954 8624: Yes I would like to know
01/02/24, 3:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
01/02/24, 3:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
01/02/24, 3:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
01/02/24, 3:42 pm - +263 78 954 8624: Oky I understand
01/02/24, 3:46 pm - +263 78 954 8624: So does it means none of these stages I have already completed right
01/02/24, 3:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 4:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ricaldo, are we connectd?
01/02/24, 4:35 pm - +263 78 954 8624: Yes we are but a little bit busy right now
01/02/24, 4:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand, Ricaldo, but we are left with only 5 minutes session, to proceed towards stage 2
01/02/24, 4:49 pm - +263 78 954 8624: Yeah is not stage one
01/02/24, 4:49 pm - +263 78 954 8624: Oky mam
01/02/24, 4:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's right!
01/02/24, 4:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, 
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you?
01/02/24, 8:06 pm - +263 78 954 8624: Yes you can mam
01/02/24, 8:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
01/02/24, 8:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
01/02/24, 8:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.

05/02/24, 3:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ricaldo,  Before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me?

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
05/02/24, 7:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: @263789548624 Are we connected?
05/02/24, 7:25 pm - +263 78 954 8624: Yes we are mam network has been the issue you know
05/02/24, 7:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand, Ricaldo!
05/02/24, 7:26 pm - +263 78 954 8624: Mam so please forgive
06/02/24, 8:14 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good morning Everyone,
How are you doing today?
06/02/24, 3:01 pm - +263 78 954 8624: 1.The name of the course that I want to do at Edoofa is the Bachelor of Business Administrator (BBA)
2.I would like to pick UK 
3.The average cost of studies in India without scholarship is that in India an international student face an average expense of 6000US -8000US dollars annually
4.The annual fee that you will pay if found eligible for the program will be 2000US -3000USD if you qualify the eligibility check process
5.The enrollment fee of the Edoofa program is 350USD and if the student is found eligible the fee is paid in 7 days 
6.Through my own understanding the Earn While You Learn Program (EWYLP) it is an Edoofa Employability through online learning in such a way that a student is assigned a real time live online projects.Through this EWYLP the student get to be assigned with some work projects for example social media marketing and by that the student get to gain skills for instance communication skills, creative skills and critical thinking skills. However you will be compensated for your efforts as it will not be in the form of cash/wages but in the form of scholarship credits and by that these scholarships credits will be used to pay part of your school fees.This clearly shows that it has been helpful to such students because it has made it more affordable and easier at Edoofa Scholarship.
06/02/24, 3:02 pm - +263 78 954 8624: Afternoon mam
06/02/24, 3:03 pm - +263 78 954 8624: I have been busy all day
06/02/24, 3:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright!
06/02/24, 3:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please note that

2) India
06/02/24, 3:04 pm - +263 78 954 8624: Oky sorry
06/02/24, 3:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, Ricaldo!
06/02/24, 3:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: @263774555449 you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
06/02/24, 3:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
06/02/24, 3:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*

There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 17th or 18th of February 2024
