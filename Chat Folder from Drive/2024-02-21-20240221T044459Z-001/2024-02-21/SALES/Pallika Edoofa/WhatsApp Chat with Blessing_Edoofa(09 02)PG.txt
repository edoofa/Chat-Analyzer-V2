09/02/24, 2:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you will be intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India have a positive impact on your career and help you achieve your goals?
09/02/24, 2:37 pm - +27 74 728 1492: Thank you so much
09/02/24, 2:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please address this.
09/02/24, 2:43 pm - +27 74 728 1492: I'm so intrigued, studying in India will have a positive impact on my career because of the above mentioned faculty expertise, getting quality mentorship will get me prepared for the nowaday industry business while being able to learn affordably. It will also help me achieve my goals because learning from the best people with so much experience will provide with some knowledge during the 3 year course from someone who expertly did Business Administration for so many years so it will also make me success hungry and ready to tackle the difficulties that may arise in my career goals.
09/02/24, 2:46 pm - +27 74 728 1492: This is the answer to your question sir
09/02/24, 2:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Blessing, Studying in India indeed sounds like an excellent opportunity for your career development. Access to experienced faculty and quality mentorship will undoubtedly prepare you for the dynamic industry landscape while keeping education affordable. Learning from seasoned professionals in Business Administration will not only equip you with valuable knowledge but also instill a hunger for success and the resilience needed to overcome challenges in achieving your career goals.
09/02/24, 2:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
09/02/24, 2:53 pm - +27 74 728 1492: I have no idea about that sir
09/02/24, 2:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
09/02/24, 2:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 2:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
09/02/24, 2:58 pm - +27 74 728 1492: Yes the reduced cost of education can be affordable to my family sir
09/02/24, 2:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
09/02/24, 3:01 pm - +27 74 728 1492: No sir
09/02/24, 3:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
09/02/24, 3:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
09/02/24, 3:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
09/02/24, 3:09 pm - +27 74 728 1492: I think the EWYL program will benefit me because it will reduce the weight off my parents shoulders while making gain experience of the digital world
09/02/24, 3:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 3:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.
09/02/24, 3:14 pm - +27 74 728 1492: Indeed sir and I'm looking forward to put as much effort if a chance is given
09/02/24, 3:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!
09/02/24, 3:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Now, as we are proceeding towards the end, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
09/02/24, 3:20 pm - +27 74 728 1492: I believe all the facts are just as important sir but I think affordability through guaranteed scholarships is the most significant
09/02/24, 3:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and maximum exposures
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn

09/02/24, 3:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
09/02/24, 3:23 pm - +27 74 728 1492: Yes I can see and it's so motivating
09/02/24, 3:23 pm - +27 74 728 1492: Both my parents will be helping me with remaining fee after the program
09/02/24, 3:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am really glad that you have understood the importance of our Program1
09/02/24, 3:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s understandable,I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
09/02/24, 3:27 pm - +27 74 728 1492: Noone in my family has studied abroad before so this whole thing is still new to them , they are a bit triggered by the costs but they are willing to try and make it possible for me to acquire better education
09/02/24, 3:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Blessing, It's completely understandable that studying abroad may seem unfamiliar and daunting, especially when considering the associated costs. However, it's incredibly commendable that your family is open to exploring this opportunity and willing to support you in pursuing a better education. With determination and careful planning, it's possible to navigate the financial aspects and make studying abroad a reality.
09/02/24, 3:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
09/02/24, 3:31 pm - +27 74 728 1492: Ok sir, so when and how are these submitted
09/02/24, 3:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Don't worry Blessing, Our Admissions Team will be guiding you regarding the same!
09/02/24, 3:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
09/02/24, 3:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 3:36 pm - +27 74 728 1492: Yes sir
09/02/24, 3:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, Let me tell you, *why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
09/02/24, 3:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
09/02/24, 3:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
09/02/24, 3:45 pm - +27 74 728 1492: Ok thank you Mr Pallika
09/02/24, 3:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 3:55 pm - +27 74 728 1492: We discussed stage 1
09/02/24, 3:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, 
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you? <This message was edited>
09/02/24, 4:00 pm - +27 74 728 1492: Yes sir you sure can
09/02/24, 4:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
09/02/24, 4:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
09/02/24, 4:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
09/02/24, 4:03 pm - +27 74 728 1492: Thank you the whole process is now clear
09/02/24, 4:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you have any queries?
09/02/24, 4:05 pm - +27 74 728 1492: No queries, I just want to know that now I wait for acceptance into the Edoofa program?
09/02/24, 4:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, Blessing, please note that as you have cleared Stage 1 and after you need to clear the eligibility check test and the interview, and the results will be given later.
09/02/24, 4:07 pm - +27 74 728 1492: Ok thank you
09/02/24, 4:08 pm - +27 74 728 1492: Everything sounds clear now
09/02/24, 4:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Blessing, we have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
09/02/24, 4:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*

*Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

10/02/24, 1:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Blessing, and Dear Parents,

Congratulations on clearing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program I hope you have learned about the program better through the previous sessions. Now, I will guide you to the most important *Eligibility check stage* after addressing your questions. 
Kindly excuse for the delay as I was in a meeting that took a little long

Are you ready for the same?
10/02/24, 1:03 pm - +27 74 728 1492: Greetings to you too Ms Pallika ,I'm ready!
10/02/24, 1:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: It is good to connect with you today, Blessing,
I hope you are doing well
10/02/24, 1:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Did you manage to discuss the Edoofa Program with your family, please?
10/02/24, 1:04 pm - +27 74 728 1492: I am doing just fine thank you
10/02/24, 1:04 pm - +27 74 728 1492: Yes we discussed about it thoroughly
10/02/24, 1:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, can you provide a summary of your family discussions regarding the Edoofa Scholarship Program and share their thoughts after learning more about the program?
10/02/24, 1:10 pm - +27 74 728 1492: Ok, we discussed mainly about affordability of the Edoofa program and quality education that can be offered in India.They were very interested in me pursuing my dream in India. They really think this program is the best for me and it's a holistic process and they trust it.
10/02/24, 1:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Excellent, well it seems that you took your family through the entire conversation which we did during your counseling session! May I know if your family has any questions for me?
10/02/24, 1:13 pm - +27 74 728 1492: I don't think so because they took their time going through all the documents and information you sent yesterday
10/02/24, 1:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That is fine, 

May I know the thoughts and opinions of your family regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
10/02/24, 1:17 pm - +27 74 728 1492: They think the enrollment fee is fair enough as they were a bit worried about the cost of education,I clearly explained to them about the EWYL program and they were much relieved so I think they can handle the pressure
10/02/24, 1:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Excellent, well it seems that you took your family through the entire conversation which we did during your counseling session! May I know if your family has any questions for me?
10/02/24, 1:23 pm - +27 67 798 0239: No Ms Pallika we are well aware of the program and it seems that Blessing is in good hands
10/02/24, 1:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This is well noted, 

May I know your thoughts regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
10/02/24, 1:47 pm - +27 67 798 0239: The fees structure sounds fair but as you know about the economic stability we are facing as Zimbabweans it would be great for our son to get a scholarship
10/02/24, 1:48 pm - +27 67 798 0239: Sorry for the late response we are having network challenges this side
10/02/24, 1:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, I understand!
10/02/24, 1:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand that You, Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months last year and let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
10/02/24, 1:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self-sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program. We also ensure they develop employability skills so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate. I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your child’s career, aren't you?
10/02/24, 1:54 pm - +27 67 798 0239: Yes that is what we exactly want for our child and we'll be very happy if he gets a chance to this one in a lifetime opportunity
10/02/24, 1:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad to know that, Ms. Sande!
10/02/24, 1:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I appreciate your willingness to invest in your child’s career
10/02/24, 1:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: May I know if Blessing is available?
10/02/24, 1:56 pm - +27 67 798 0239: Ok Ms Pallika
10/02/24, 1:56 pm - +27 67 798 0239: Yes he is available but he is having network challenges
10/02/24, 1:57 pm - +27 74 728 1492: Sorry for the late replies Ms Pallika we are having network challenges this side as we have no electricity
10/02/24, 1:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand that the network challenges in your area, Blessing!
10/02/24, 1:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Blessing,  Before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me?

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
10/02/24, 2:01 pm - +27 74 728 1492: Ok Ms Pallika
10/02/24, 2:18 pm - +27 74 728 1492: 1. Business Administration
2.India
3.$6000 to$8000 annually
4.$2000 to$3000 if found eligible
5. It's $350 ,$200 should be paid in 7 days and the $150 within 30 days

6.The Earn While You Learn program will reduce the financial pressure to my family while I'll be able to afford the higher education and I will be acquiring skills of the digital world. The EWYL program has no limit thus a student can earn up to $75 or more depending on how much he/ she works. This is a holistic approach to higher education because it prepares the student for the nowaday industry while being able to support him/herself financially and also preparing the student for the real world
7.Yes that it is clear Ms Pallika
10/02/24, 2:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well done, Blessing!
10/02/24, 2:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: @27684422444 @27677980239 you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
10/02/24, 2:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
10/02/24, 2:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*


Please address this using voice notes!
10/02/24, 2:44 pm - +27 74 728 1492: Sorry Ms Pallika is in a situation right now she'll get back to you as soon as possible
10/02/24, 3:29 pm - +27 74 728 1492: My mom*
10/02/24, 4:31 pm - +27 67 798 0239: <Media omitted>
10/02/24, 8:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, Ms. Sande, I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
10/02/24, 8:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
10/02/24, 8:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below
10/02/24, 8:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/02/24, 8:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope now you know Ideally, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 17th or 18th of February 2024 for $200 and the 17th or 18th of March for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 17th or 18th of February 2024

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?

14/02/24, 12:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Sande, I will let you know , may I know re you clear with the modes of enrollment fee payment?
14/02/24, 2:21 pm - +27 67 798 0239: That is fine with me!!
14/02/24, 2:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Let me help you with the modes of enrollment fee payment
Mode 1) Direct Transaction Through The Bank
You can transfer payment from your bank account directly to our Organization's account using this banking details.
*Swift code*:AXISINBB207
*IFSC code*:UTIB0001147
*Account Name*:Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd.
*Current Account Number* 917020070183626
*Bank's Name*: Axis Bank Ltd.
*Bank’s Address*: Janakpuri, B Block, Neww Delhi[DL]
Ground Floor & Basement, B-1/503, Janakpuri, New Delhi 110058
*But the transaction charges vary from $50 to above because it is an international transaction, you also need a foreign Currency Account and that is why, the second mode is recommended*
14/02/24, 2:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mode 2: Through our associate in Zimbabwe
14/02/24, 2:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mr Charles Jerera is a well-known Educationalist from Zimbabwe who is also our associate and has worked with Ministries, Stakeholders and Institutions. He had worked over 4 years in Masvingo Province and a total of 20+ years in Zimbabwe under the Ministry of Education, as a District Officer, and a cultural Officer, with the Ministry of Local Government and has retired from the Ministry of Sports, Arts and Recreation. His son is an Edoofian and arrived in India on 16th August last year

For the entire $350 the necessary amount including the transfer charges would be 12.5% of the payable amount and the process would be similar, you would be visiting the bank branch and depositing the fee in his account, the same details are as below:-
*Bank:* FBC
*Account Holder's Name:* Charles Jerera
*Account Number:* 5333 0380 1404 8828
*Swift Code:* FBCPZWHA
*Branch:* Masvingo
*Contact Number:* +263 77 376 9854

*You can also use PayPal or Payment mode on our website(10% transfer charges) if you have an international credit card or debit card to pay directly to our organization's bank account. This would be a direct mode of transaction*
14/02/24, 2:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.
So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-
BANK NAME: FBC
SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA
ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA
ACC NUMBER: 5333038014048828
CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854
16/02/24, 9:06 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Everyone,
How are you all doing?
16/02/24, 9:06 am - Pallika Edoofa: Kindly excuse me as I was unable to connect with you earlier as I was a bit under the weather.

16/02/24, 9:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I was expecting a response from you, May I know if everything is alright?
16/02/24, 9:37 pm - +27 74 728 1492: Good evening Ms Pallika
16/02/24, 9:37 pm - +27 74 728 1492: We were having network challenges lately
16/02/24, 9:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand the network challenges in your area!
16/02/24, 9:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since I connected you with Mr and Mrs. Jerera, did you happen to speak with them?
16/02/24, 9:43 pm - +27 74 728 1492: Not yet but we will soon be in touch with them
16/02/24, 9:43 pm - +27 74 728 1492: So there is no way we can get a less transfer charge, maybe another option
16/02/24, 9:50 pm - +27 74 728 1492: If there is no other option it's okay we will have to opt for Mr Jerera
16/02/24, 9:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Blessing, Please note that you can use Mama money as it is a cheaper mode of payment from South Africa through which you can pay in Rands at the nearby shops. 

There are two options for the same, 1) We have Mrs. Christine Rockson, the Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, Kempton Park Johannesburg, Gauteng Province, South Africa who has her child, Tadiwanashe Rockson studying in India under the Edoofa program!

She has been helping parents in South Africa to create Mama Money orders for the payment of enrollment fees. We will share the Mama Money order with you. You can visit nearby shops to pay the order

2) We can share the order with you and you can proceed with the transaction at the nearby shops
16/02/24, 11:36 pm - +27 74 728 1492: That sounds okay
16/02/24, 11:36 pm - +27 74 728 1492: So the money is less than $394 right??
17/02/24, 10:20 am - Pallika Edoofa: Yes!
17/02/24, 12:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Are we connected, Blessing or Ms. Sande?

17/02/24, 1:17 pm - +27 74 728 1492: The first $200 will be definitely sent on Monday if that's okay
17/02/24, 1:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Blessing!
17/02/24, 1:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, That is well noted, May I know through which mode are you going to pay?
17/02/24, 1:19 pm - +27 74 728 1492: We were thinking of Mama money
