*3. EWYL Program Instructions and Pledge Document:* In the form, you will find a section where you are required to specify the date on which you intend to commence your EWYL journey. The next batch is scheduled to start on *Tuesday (23 January 2024)* . If you are enthusiastic about beginning the procedures on that particular date, please fill it in accordingly. However, if you are unavailable to commence your EWYL Journey on that date, please inform us, and we will propose an alternative date for the next session. Our aim is to align this with your availability to ensure a smooth transition.
17/1/24, 11:23 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The column "orientation availability" refers to a 3-day window following the commencement of your EWYL program, which, in your case, is on January 23. After the initiation, you will have a 3-day period during which you will commence your EWYL orientation, specifically from January 23 to January 26 in your situation. Your EWYL program initiation date remains January 23, and you are required to input a date between January 23 and January 26 for your Orientation program. It is permissible for both the EWYL Program availability and Orientation availability to share the same date. If you are available for the orientation on January 23 itself, kindly indicate so.
17/1/24, 11:23 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: With this form that has been shared with you, I have shared all the forms you have to submit to begin your procedures, please let me know once you have taken note of them so that we can move forward.

17/1/24, 11:37 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moving forward, as a part of your application file, you will need to visit your school and secure a letter of recommendation from them. We have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process.
17/1/24, 11:37 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, *your subject combination for A Level exams*, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
17/1/24, 11:37 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to inquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?

17/1/24, 11:47 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: For the next couple of days, we will have sessions on a daily basis and once we cover the first three steps of the admission cycle, we will have sessions scheduled on a need basis. Hence, can you let me know at what time you would like us to schedule our sessions on a daily basis (from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM)?

19/1/24, 10:18 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
19/1/24, 10:20 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Understood
19/1/24, 10:22 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counselling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counselling session will take about 1 hour.
19/1/24, 10:22 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
19/1/24, 10:24 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Ok thank you
19/1/24, 10:24 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Understood
19/1/24, 11:03 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
19/1/24, 11:03 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
19/1/24, 11:05 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Ok ma’am thank you
19/1/24, 11:05 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Ma’am I did not get my scholarship percentage

19/1/24, 11:32 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I see. Thank you for sharing the screenshot with me to explain it. May I know if you are confused about the score or the scholarship percentage?
19/1/24, 12:03 PM - +263 71 445 2768: The scholarship percentage
19/1/24, 12:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The scholarship percentage has been awarded on the basis of the evaluation of academic board. It refers to the minimum scholarship percentage you will receive in your offer letter once the university has accepted your application. I hope this was helpful?
19/1/24, 12:53 PM - +263 71 445 2768: Now it’s clear
19/1/24, 12:53 PM - +263 71 445 2768: Thank you ma’am for helping me

22/1/24, 7:38 AM - +263 71 445 2768: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 9:58 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Anotida. Thank you for sharing the answers and screenshot with me. I have duly taken a note of it. May I ask how you all are doing today?
22/1/24, 10:06 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Good morning ma’am
22/1/24, 10:06 AM - +263 71 445 2768: I’m doing good.
22/1/24, 10:08 AM - +263 77 256 4012: Good morning how are you doing
22/1/24, 10:09 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are all doing good. I am doing fine myself, thank you for asking. Our session is scheduled for 11 AM. However, since you had previously sent a message, I just wanted to inquire if you are currently available to proceed with our discussion or do you wish to commence our session at 11 AM itself?
22/1/24, 10:11 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Yes I’m available we can start.
22/1/24, 10:13 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.
22/1/24, 10:13 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Ok ma’am
22/1/24, 10:14 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 12 February 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
22/1/24, 10:14 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Thank you for updating us
22/1/24, 10:15 AM - +263 71 445 2768: I discussed with my parents last night that the remaining $150 is going to be paid on the 4th of February 2024
22/1/24, 10:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.
22/1/24, 10:17 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
22/1/24, 10:17 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Ok ma’am
22/1/24, 10:17 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Yes ma’am that’s true
22/1/24, 10:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
22/1/24, 10:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
22/1/24, 10:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
22/1/24, 10:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
22/1/24, 10:28 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Thank you ma’am
22/1/24, 10:28 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Noted
22/1/24, 10:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
22/1/24, 10:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
22/1/24, 10:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
22/1/24, 10:36 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Yes we discussed about it
22/1/24, 10:36 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Understood
22/1/24, 10:43 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
22/1/24, 10:46 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Sorry ma’am I didn’t understand the last part which is talking about food expenses and accommodation
22/1/24, 10:48 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Which part of it is confusing for you Anotida?
22/1/24, 10:49 AM - +263 71 445 2768: The mentioned amount is going to cover for all the expenses that you have stated for my first year in India
22/1/24, 10:51 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes Anotida. Your entire cost of education will be covered in the said amount of $1200 - $1800.
22/1/24, 10:55 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Ok ma’am understood
22/1/24, 10:55 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Thank you for making it clear
22/1/24, 11:01 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
22/1/24, 11:01 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*
22/1/24, 11:01 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $1650). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
22/1/24, 11:03 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Noted
22/1/24, 11:04 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1650 as per the above example.
22/1/24, 11:05 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1650 - $1000 = $650. This amount can be paid in two installments of $325 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India.
22/1/24, 11:05 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Subsequently, the remaining balance of $325 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
22/1/24, 11:07 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Understood
22/1/24, 11:07 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Thank you
22/1/24, 11:08 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
22/1/24, 11:08 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
22/1/24, 11:08 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
22/1/24, 11:12 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Thank you ma’am
22/1/24, 11:12 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Ma’am I have a question
22/1/24, 11:12 AM - +263 71 445 2768: You have mentioned about accommodation what if I don’t need accommodation. For example in my case I will be staying off residence what do I have to do.
22/1/24, 11:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: You will have the choice of opting for off-campus accommodation once you receive your offer letter, Anotida. I hope this was helpful?
22/1/24, 11:47 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Understood ma’am
22/1/24, 11:47 AM - +263 71 445 2768: So instead of paying 1650 I will have to pay 1000 is this correct
22/1/24, 11:55 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I believe there has been a confusion. Allow me to help you understand it better. If you choose to opt for off-campus accommodation, even that will have certain costs. In case you wish to opt out of choosing on-campus accommodation, you will be required to make payments for your off-campus accommodation. However, when you avail that option, you will have the opportunity to choose the best facility that is suitable for you, after considering factors like cost, quality of food and facilities provided by the accommodation.
22/1/24, 11:55 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I hope this was helpful?
22/1/24, 12:17 PM - +263 71 445 2768: Thank you for making this clear.
22/1/24, 12:17 PM - +263 71 445 2768: Yes
22/1/24, 12:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome Anotida. Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.
22/1/24, 12:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
22/1/24, 12:38 PM - +263 71 445 2768: Thank you ma’am
22/1/24, 12:41 PM - +263 71 445 2768: No I don’t have
22/1/24, 1:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
22/1/24, 1:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
22/1/24, 1:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.

22/1/24, 1:29 PM - +263 71 445 2768: Yes we are very excited
22/1/24, 1:30 PM - +263 71 445 2768: Thank you ma’am
22/1/24, 1:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that Anotida. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
22/1/24, 1:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
22/1/24, 1:31 PM - +263 71 445 2768: I can’t wait to start the exciting journey.
22/1/24, 1:32 PM - +263 71 445 2768: Yes ma’am
22/1/24, 1:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
22/1/24, 1:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
22/1/24, 1:36 PM - +263 71 445 2768: Yes ma’am I’m aware of that
22/1/24, 1:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Allow me to help you understand it better. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
22/1/24, 1:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
22/1/24, 1:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
22/1/24, 1:42 PM - +263 71 445 2768: Understood
22/1/24, 1:43 PM - +263 71 445 2768: Thank you
22/1/24, 1:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Friday (23 January 2024).
22/1/24, 1:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Tuesday, as previously agreed upon.

To kick start the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

22/1/24, 1:52 PM - +263 71 445 2768: No ma’am
22/1/24, 1:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, dear. With this, we can proceed to step 4 of the admission cycle, i.e., Offer Letter from University/College.
