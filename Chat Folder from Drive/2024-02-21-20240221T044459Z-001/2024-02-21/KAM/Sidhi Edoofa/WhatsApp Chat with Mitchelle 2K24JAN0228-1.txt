16/1/24, 10:12 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Fantastic! Now over the next four days, our focus as your admission team will be on equipping you with a comprehensive understanding of what lies ahead in your university admission journey and help you commence the same.
16/1/24, 10:13 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Soon after, we will guide you through the initiation of your EWYL Journey. The next batch of EWYL Sessions is scheduled to commence on Friday (19th January) and hence, if we are able to focus and complete the Admission Process before Thursday (18 January) with pure consistency, you will be able to start your EWYL journey as well in a timely manner.
16/1/24, 10:13 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly mark this date on your calendar and ensure that you are available to complete the necessary procedures within the stipulated timeline. If everything is proceeding as planned so far, shall we move forward and begin our session for the day?
16/1/24, 10:13 AM - +27 65 730 0423: Yes mam
16/1/24, 10:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
16/1/24, 10:17 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Mitchelle 2K24JAN0228)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
16/1/24, 10:17 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Mitchelle EWYL23E1163)* . In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
16/1/24, 10:21 AM - +27 65 730 0423: Yes I am mam
16/1/24, 10:22 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counsellor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counselling session with your counsellor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
16/1/24, 10:26 AM - +27 65 730 0423: For me it has to be the Eligibility check and also the Acceptance letter
16/1/24, 10:27 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that, dear. Could you share what particularly impressed you about these aspects?
16/1/24, 10:32 AM - +27 65 730 0423: The Eligibility check was kind of scary but lowkey exciting as I excited talking about what I know about Life science as it is a subject I enjoyed alot in school. Their questions were different as they did not require me to talk about myself but instead the subject at hand which I enjoyed. The acceptance letter was most exciting thing for me as I did not expect that I had done very well and seeing my parents happy about it just made it the best process.
16/1/24, 10:35 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you found the process to be exciting and helpful.
16/1/24, 10:35 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moving forward with the procedures, I would like to share an insight with you. To ensure a seamless experience, we, as a team, have prepared essential documents that not only value your feedback but also outline the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program and the application process. You will have to review, complete, and submit these documents as instructed. 

If you are ready, shall I share a brief overview of these documents for your ease?
16/1/24, 10:36 AM - +27 65 730 0423: I am ready mam
16/1/24, 10:37 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Perfect! Let's delve into the documents that are crucial for your journey with Edoofa.

Hence, I have asked you to print out the feedback form. You have to fill in the same feedback form by hand and affix a passport-sized photo as indicated. Once completed, you have to scan the document or click a picture and share it with us here in your admission group. Please let me know if you have gone through the above document that I shared so that I can share the second form which is an online Google form.
16/1/24, 10:40 AM - +27 65 730 0423: Yes I have mam
16/1/24, 10:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that, now following with a second form which is an *Online Google Form*.

16/1/24, 10:42 AM - +27 65 730 0423: Yes I have taken note mam
16/1/24, 10:44 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Great to hear that you've taken note of the second form as well. Now, moving on to the third and final form:

*3. EWYL Program Instructions and Pledge Document:* In the form, you will find a section where you are required to specify the date on which you intend to commence your EWYL journey. The next batch is scheduled to start on *Friday (19th January 2024)* . If you are enthusiastic about beginning the procedures on that particular date, please fill it in accordingly. However, if you are unavailable to commence your EWYL Journey on that date, please inform us, and we will propose an alternative date for the next session. Our aim is to align this with your availability to ensure a smooth transition.

With this form that has been shared with you, I have shared all the forms you have to submit to begin your procedures, please let me know once you have taken note of them so that we can move forward.
16/1/24, 10:46 AM - +27 65 730 0423: I have mam
16/1/24, 11:53 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Along with these forms, I have asked you to share your academic documents with us. I am currently waiting for that as well.

Moving forward, as a part of your application file, you will need to visit your school and secure a letter of recommendation from them. We have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process.
16/1/24, 11:53 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, your subject combination for A Level exams, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
16/1/24, 11:53 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to inquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?
16/1/24, 12:00 PM - +27 65 730 0423: Mam if I may ask which academic results are you still waiting if it the matric final results they are to be expected this week if not next week
16/1/24, 12:00 PM - +27 65 730 0423: By Friday 19 January

*1. A-Level Results/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*
*2. O-Level Results.*
*3. Identity proof (International Travelling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate).*
16/1/24, 12:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I believe there was a misunderstanding previously, dear. However, the documents I was talking about are mentioned above.
16/1/24, 12:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well, dear. I have taken a note of it and I am looking forward to getting an update from your end. I would also like to reiterate that our operational hours are from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM, Central African Time.
16/1/24, 12:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Considering this, for our future sessions, you have to decide on an hour’s time that suits your availability within this timeframe and share the same with us so that we can tailor our subsequent sessions to accommodate your schedule effectively.
16/1/24, 12:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For the next couple of days, we will have sessions on a daily basis and once we cover the first three steps of the admission cycle, we will have sessions scheduled on a need basis. Hence, can you let me know at what time you would like us to schedule our sessions on a daily basis (from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM)?
16/1/24, 12:04 PM - +27 65 730 0423: Anytime that you are available at mam
16/1/24, 12:04 PM - +27 65 730 0423: Noted
16/1/24, 12:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well, dear. In that case, I hope 8:30 AM is a suitable time for you?
16/1/24, 12:19 PM - +27 65 730 0423: Yes it is mam
16/1/24, 12:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, in such a case, we will schedule tomorrow’s session at this time. It's important to note that all three forms and your academic documents with the Letter of recommendation should be completed and submitted by tomorrow before our session. 

This timeline is essential to ensure a smooth progression in the admission process and to meet the goal of concluding this session before Thursday, enabling us to assist you in initiating your EWYL process on time. I hope we are together with this? <This message was edited>
16/1/24, 12:21 PM - +27 65 730 0423: Yes we are mam <This message was edited>

17/1/24, 8:53 AM - +27 65 730 0423: Mam I wanted to ask about the orientation availability date
17/1/24, 9:00 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
17/1/24, 9:01 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Allow me to help you understand it better, dear. The column "orientation availability" refers to a 3-day window following the commencement of your EWYL program, which, in your case, is on January 19. After the initiation, you will have a 3-day period during which you will commence your EWYL orientation, specifically from January 19 to January 22 in your situation. Your EWYL program initiation date remains January 19, and you are required to input a date between January 19 and January 22 for your Orientation program. It is permissible for both the EWYL Program availability and Orientation availability to share the same date. If you are available for the orientation on January 19 itself, kindly indicate so. I hope I am clear?
17/1/24, 9:02 AM - +27 65 730 0423: <Media omitted>
17/1/24, 9:02 AM - +27 65 730 0423: Yes mam
17/1/24, 9:06 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the documents. Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
17/1/24, 9:07 AM - +27 65 730 0423: Yes mam
17/1/24, 9:13 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/1/24, 9:13 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, I would encourage you to go through the above image representing your university admission process and once you are done, let me know so that I can explain the same to you in detail.
17/1/24, 9:14 AM - +27 65 730 0423: I am done mam
17/1/24, 9:20 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
17/1/24, 9:20 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
17/1/24, 9:21 AM - +27 65 730 0423: They are mam
17/1/24, 9:26 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
17/1/24, 9:26 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
17/1/24, 9:27 AM - +27 65 730 0423: I am mam
17/1/24, 9:38 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
17/1/24, 9:38 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

19/1/24, 10:26 AM - +27 65 730 0423: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 10:29 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well, dear. Thank you for sharing the screenshot with me. Now, if you are ready, shall we proceed with our session today?
19/1/24, 10:30 AM - +27 65 730 0423: Yes mam
19/1/24, 10:31 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well, dear. Before we start with our session, I would like to ask you whether you were able to get an update on your Letter of Recommendation?
19/1/24, 10:37 AM - +27 65 730 0423: With the recommendation letter  the teacher behind has not given any feedback yet but I did message him to confirm.
19/1/24, 10:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Okay, dear. I understand. I will look forward to getting an update from you about the same. In the meanwhile, if you are ready, shall we move forward with our session?
19/1/24, 10:44 AM - +27 65 730 0423: Yes please mam
19/1/24, 10:54 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you provide us with the documents, we will have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. Since we are awaiting your documents, in the meanwhile we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
19/1/24, 10:54 AM - +27 65 730 0423: Yes mam
19/1/24, 11:06 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 10 February 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
19/1/24, 11:07 AM - +27 65 730 0423: Yes mam
19/1/24, 11:22 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.
19/1/24, 11:22 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelor of Physiotherapy and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
19/1/24, 11:23 AM - +27 65 730 0423: Yes it is mam
19/1/24, 11:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
19/1/24, 11:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
19/1/24, 11:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
19/1/24, 11:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
19/1/24, 11:35 AM - +27 65 730 0423: Yes I do mam
19/1/24, 11:36 AM - +27 65 730 0423: Mam I wanted to ask what are the requirements to get accepted into the course
19/1/24, 11:50 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. May I know your thoughts behind this query? Are you asking just out of curiosity or do you have some other thoughts?
19/1/24, 11:51 AM - +27 65 730 0423: Out of curiosity mam so I know how my results are expected to look
19/1/24, 11:52 AM - +27 65 730 0423: And if I don't meet requirements will Edoofa give me a diploma course or I will be removed from the program
19/1/24, 11:59 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand your concern, dear. However, I believe your grade 12 results have not been declared yet, right?
19/1/24, 12:00 PM - +27 65 730 0423: Yes mam
19/1/24, 12:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you need not worry about not meeting the requirements, dear. Be rest assured that in a situation where your results are not as expected, we will guide you towards the next step to take in the right direction. I hope this was helpful?
19/1/24, 12:44 PM - +27 65 730 0423: Yes mam
19/1/24, 12:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well, dear. In that case, if you are ready, shall we move forward with our session?
19/1/24, 12:52 PM - +27 65 730 0423: Yes mam
19/1/24, 12:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
19/1/24, 12:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
19/1/24, 12:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee.
19/1/24, 12:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
19/1/24, 12:56 PM - +27 65 730 0423: Yes mam
19/1/24, 1:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
19/1/24, 1:49 PM - +27 65 730 0423: Yes mam
19/1/24, 3:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that we are on the same page, Mitchelle. I apologize for the delay in my response as I had to attend an urgent work-related meeting. I hope you are still available to continue with our discussion dear?
19/1/24, 3:46 PM - +27 65 730 0423: Yes mam
19/1/24, 3:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy that we are still connected, dear.
19/1/24, 3:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
19/1/24, 3:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*

Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
19/1/24, 3:52 PM - +27 65 730 0423: Yes I have mam
19/1/24, 3:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
19/1/24, 3:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. <This message was edited>
19/1/24, 3:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.

19/1/24, 4:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
19/1/24, 4:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
19/1/24, 4:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
19/1/24, 4:10 PM - +27 65 730 0423: Noted mam
19/1/24, 4:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.
19/1/24, 4:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/1/24, 4:17 PM - +27 65 730 0423: No I don't mam
19/1/24, 4:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
19/1/24, 4:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
19/1/24, 4:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
19/1/24, 4:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 4:33 PM - +27 65 730 0423: Yes mam
19/1/24, 4:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
19/1/24, 4:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
19/1/24, 4:51 PM - +27 65 730 0423: Yes I am mam
19/1/24, 4:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
19/1/24, 4:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
19/1/24, 5:02 PM - +27 65 730 0423: Yes mam it will truly help us
19/1/24, 5:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
19/1/24, 5:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university [For most of the universities 15 days]. Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
19/1/24, 5:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
19/1/24, 5:03 PM - +27 65 730 0423: No mam ,I follow mam <This message was edited>
19/1/24, 5:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/1/24, 5:04 PM - +27 65 730 0423: No I don't have mam
19/1/24, 5:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
19/1/24, 5:15 PM - +27 65 730 0423: Yes I am very much mam
19/1/24, 5:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, I would like to request you to give me an update regarding your Letter of Recommendation as the document is necessary for us to proceed to the next step of the admission cycle i.e., Offer Letter from University.

19/1/24, 5:22 PM - +27 65 730 0423: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 5:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand, dear. In case the teacher is delaying the process, it is best if you are able to visit your school and meet your principle to obtain the letter of recommendation. This way, you will be able to ensure that you get all the details on the Letter of Recommendation correctly and obtain it during the same visit as well.
