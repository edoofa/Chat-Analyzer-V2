17/1/24, 8:54 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end.

17/1/24, 9:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The column "orientation availability" refers to a 3-day window following the commencement of your EWYL program, which, in your case, is on January 23. After the initiation, you will have a 3-day period during which you will commence your EWYL orientation, specifically from January 23 to January 26 in your situation. Your EWYL program initiation date remains January 23, and you are required to input a date between January 23 and January 26 for your Orientation program. It is permissible for both the EWYL Program availability and Orientation availability to share the same date. If you are available for the orientation on January 23 itself, kindly indicate so. I hope I am clear?

Moving forward, as a part of your application file, you will need to visit your school and secure a letter of recommendation from them. We have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process.
17/1/24, 10:11 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, *your subject combination for A Level exams*, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
17/1/24, 10:11 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to inquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?
17/1/24, 10:16 AM - +263 71 523 9347: Ok  Ms Siddhi

17/1/24, 11:27 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In case it is very inconvenient for you to get a Letter of Recommendation, and you have your A-Level Results or Statement of Entry with you, you can share the same.
17/1/24, 11:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I hope you are clear about the same?

17/1/24, 11:40 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: For the next couple of days, we will have sessions on a daily basis and once we cover the first three steps of the admission cycle, we will have sessions scheduled on a need basis. Hence, can you let me know at what time you would like us to schedule our sessions on a daily basis (from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM)?

18/1/24, 10:01 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Am I correct?
18/1/24, 10:02 AM - +263 71 523 9347: Ok
18/1/24, 10:14 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: For today's date you can enter the same i.e., 18 January. Your EWYL Program is scheduled to begin on 23 January. Hence your EWYL Program Availability date will be 23 January. In case you are unavailable on the date, you need to inform us so that we can reschedule your EWYL Program commencement accordingly.
18/1/24, 10:15 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Lastly, the column "orientation availability" refers to a 3-day window following the commencement of your EWYL program, which, in your case, is on January 23. After the initiation, you will have a 3-day period during which you will commence your EWYL orientation, specifically from January 23 to January 26 in your situation. Your EWYL program initiation date remains January 23, and you are required to input a date between January 23 and January 26 for your Orientation program. It is permissible for both the EWYL Program availability and Orientation availability to share the same date. If you are available for the orientation on January 23 itself, kindly indicate so. I hope I am clear?
18/1/24, 10:15 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I hope this was helpful, dear?

For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
18/1/24, 12:05 PM - +263 71 523 9347: Yes
18/1/24, 12:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 12:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, I would encourage you to go through the above image representing your university admission process and once you are done, let me know so that I can explain the same to you in detail.
18/1/24, 12:14 PM - +263 71 523 9347: Yes I'm done
18/1/24, 12:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
18/1/24, 12:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
18/1/24, 12:25 PM - +263 71 523 9347: Explain further the first stage
18/1/24, 12:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: After I am done briefing you about all the 6 steps, we will move forward to the first step i.e., message from the founder's office. Once we commence the step 1, you will be able to gain more clarity on the same. I hope you are following?
18/1/24, 12:29 PM - +263 71 523 9347: Yes
18/1/24, 12:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counselling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counselling session will take about 1 hour.
18/1/24, 12:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
18/1/24, 12:36 PM - +263 71 523 9347: Yes
18/1/24, 12:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
18/1/24, 12:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
18/1/24, 12:40 PM - +263 71 523 9347: Ok I understand
18/1/24, 12:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
18/1/24, 12:58 PM - +263 71 523 9347: I don't have any query
18/1/24, 1:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
18/1/24, 1:00 PM - +263 71 523 9347: Yes
18/1/24, 1:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
18/1/24, 1:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. You may take today’s time for the same. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?

20/1/24, 9:32 AM - +263 71 523 9347: Qn. What is the importance of human resource in an organization

Human resource plays a key role in developing, reinforcing and changing the culture of an  organization.It is department that deals with the recruitment of good workers inorder to improve the operation of the organization hence leading to profit maximization.Human Resource department also deals with the motivation of workers through different ways from motivation theories for example Bakers inn Bakery here in Zimbabwe motivates it's workers buy increasing their salaries.Human resource department is also important to the organization because this is where professional workers are trained through on the job training or off the job training before starting their job and this is done for example in manufacturing industries where machines are mostly used to prevent accidents.It is the department that deals with selection of workers from pool of candidates that have applied for the job and also deals with the promotion and demotion of workers in an organization .In an organization again human resource deals with healthy and safety of their workers in order to maintain the continuous operation at the organization and this promotes high sales leading to high profit as well.
20/1/24, 9:32 AM - +263 71 523 9347: Qn.How does business contribute to economic development.

Business contribute to economic development to a greater extend because it is an economic entity that utilities resources to provide goods and services that set to satisfy unlimited human needs and firstly,it provides goods and services ,it stimulate consumer spending and drive the demand and this in turn leads to an increase in an economic output and the overall Gross domestic product of our country Zimbabwe.Secondly, the creation of jobs through business contribute to economic development since citizens of Zimbabwe are being employed and this increases out GDP per Capita as compared to other countries for example south Africa and India.Small businesses often serve niche markerts or offer unique products , adding diversity and innovation to the economy.The business also contribute to economic development creating goods to export using the scarce resources in the economy hence leading to the gaining of foreign currency leading to higher GDP of the country .The business also provides taxes to the government and gain money to pay their civil servants for example here in Zimbabwe and this improves the living standards in the economy.

20/1/24, 9:32 AM - +263 71 523 9347: Qn.Explain with an example from your life which shows your managerial talent or skill

I innocent Charuma ,last year when I was in upper six at Ndarama high school here in masvingo province ,we had an educational trip as upper six students to Victoria falls so I was one of the students selected to organize the trip with our teachers Mr Rukovo and Mr Chengeta. I was looking after the male students with Mr Rukovo because of my behavior and also helping to do budgets because we had scarce resources as a school to satisfy unlimited wants and needs for more than 50 students so from there I discovered that I am a good leader with managerial skills 
Secondly ,when I was grade 7 at Zengeya primary school in Bikita I was selected to be vice headboy because of my managerial talent of leading other students in doing practical work,school work and even being presentable even at home helping my parents to use the available resources wisely shows that I have managerial talent

20/1/24, 9:32 AM - +263 71 523 9347: <Media omitted>
20/1/24, 10:31 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Innocent. How are you all doing today?
20/1/24, 10:31 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the screenshot and the answers Innocent. I have taken a note of it.
20/1/24, 10:39 AM - +263 71 523 9347: We are fine
20/1/24, 10:39 AM - +263 71 523 9347: Ok
20/1/24, 10:40 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we proceed, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 15 February 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction? <This message was edited>
20/1/24, 10:41 AM - +263 71 523 9347: Yes
20/1/24, 10:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.
20/1/24, 10:41 AM - +263 71 523 9347: Ok no problem
20/1/24, 10:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BBA and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
20/1/24, 10:42 AM - +263 71 523 9347: Yes
20/1/24, 10:46 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
20/1/24, 10:46 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
20/1/24, 10:46 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
20/1/24, 10:46 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
20/1/24, 10:47 AM - +263 71 523 9347: Ok
20/1/24, 10:47 AM - +263 71 523 9347: Yes
20/1/24, 10:48 AM - +263 71 523 9347: Ok
20/1/24, 10:49 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
20/1/24, 10:49 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
20/1/24, 10:49 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
20/1/24, 10:50 AM - +263 71 523 9347: Ok
20/1/24, 10:50 AM - +263 71 523 9347: Ok
20/1/24, 10:51 AM - +263 71 523 9347: Yes
20/1/24, 10:52 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
20/1/24, 10:53 AM - +263 71 523 9347: Ok
20/1/24, 10:54 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
20/1/24, 10:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*
20/1/24, 10:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $1650). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
20/1/24, 10:57 AM - +263 71 523 9347: Yes
20/1/24, 10:58 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1650 as per the above example.
20/1/24, 10:58 AM - +263 71 523 9347: Ok
20/1/24, 10:58 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1650 - $1000 = $650. This amount can be paid in two installments of $325 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $325 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
20/1/24, 11:00 AM - +263 71 523 9347: Ok
20/1/24, 11:22 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
20/1/24, 11:22 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
20/1/24, 11:22 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
20/1/24, 11:52 AM - +263 71 523 9347: Ok
20/1/24, 11:53 AM - +263 71 523 9347: Ok
20/1/24, 12:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.
20/1/24, 12:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
20/1/24, 12:43 PM - +263 71 523 9347: Ok
20/1/24, 12:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
20/1/24, 12:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
20/1/24, 12:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
20/1/24, 12:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/1/24, 12:46 PM - +263 71 523 9347: Great
20/1/24, 12:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, indeed Innocent. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
20/1/24, 12:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
20/1/24, 12:54 PM - +263 71 523 9347: Yes
20/1/24, 1:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
20/1/24, 1:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
20/1/24, 1:04 PM - +263 71 523 9347: Yes
20/1/24, 1:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
20/1/24, 1:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
20/1/24, 1:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
20/1/24, 1:12 PM - +263 71 523 9347: No
20/1/24, 1:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
20/1/24, 1:35 PM - +263 71 523 9347: Let's move
20/1/24, 1:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Friday (23 January 2024).
