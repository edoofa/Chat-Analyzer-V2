17/1/24, 10:10 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Tinashe 2K23SEP0223R)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
17/1/24, 10:10 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Tinashe EWYL23E0685)* . In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
17/1/24, 10:13 AM - +263 78 555 3504: Yes, thank you. I understand.
17/1/24, 10:26 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counsellor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counselling session with your counsellor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
17/1/24, 10:31 AM - +263 78 555 3504: Thank you very much.

The EWYL program has been the most impressive in my opinion. Not only is it an amenity to fund my education, it seems like an excellent learning opportunity as well.
17/1/24, 10:38 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you find the program to be so helpful.
17/1/24, 10:38 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moving forward with the procedures, I would like to share an insight with you. To ensure a seamless experience, we, as a team, have prepared essential documents that not only value your feedback but also outline the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program and the application process. You will have to review, complete, and submit these documents as instructed. 

If you are ready, shall I share a brief overview of these documents for your ease?

17/1/24, 11:36 AM - +263 78 555 3504: Right now I'm experiencing technical difficulties, are you able to send and I can review it later on?

17/1/24, 12:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The column "orientation availability" refers to a 3-day window following the commencement of your EWYL program, which, in your case, is on January 23. After the initiation, you will have a 3-day period during which you will commence your EWYL orientation, specifically from January 23 to January 26 in your situation. Your EWYL program initiation date remains January 23, and you are required to input a date between January 23 and January 26 for your Orientation program. It is permissible for both the EWYL Program availability and Orientation availability to share the same date. If you are available for the orientation on January 23 itself, kindly indicate so. I hope I am clear?
17/1/24, 12:25 PM - +263 78 555 3504: I have a question regarding the orientation of the EWYL Program.
Do I have to have access to the Internet for me to take part?
17/1/24, 12:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, dear. You will require internet access to be able to participate in the program. However, the sessions will mostly be conducted through WhatsApp itself, but the activities may require you to access internet. I hope I am clear?
17/1/24, 12:32 PM - +263 78 555 3504: I understand fully. Thank you.
17/1/24, 12:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that and I am looking forward to getting an update from your end. I would also like to reiterate that our operational hours are from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM, Central African Time.
17/1/24, 12:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Considering this, for our future sessions, you have to decide on an hour’s time that suits your availability within this timeframe and share the same with us so that we can tailor our subsequent sessions to accommodate your schedule effectively.
17/1/24, 12:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For the next couple of days, we will have sessions on a daily basis and once we cover the first three steps of the admission cycle, we will have sessions scheduled on a need basis. Hence, can you let me know at what time you would like us to schedule our sessions on a daily basis (from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM)?
17/1/24, 12:36 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Eight am to four pm is fine, thank you.
17/1/24, 12:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 8:00 AM for our next session.

18/1/24, 9:07 AM - +263 78 555 3504: Morning ma'am, I'm doing well thank you, how are you?

18/1/24, 10:19 AM - +263 78 555 3504: Yes, I am ready to start.
18/1/24, 10:20 AM - +263 78 555 3504: It's alright.
18/1/24, 10:27 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
18/1/24, 10:28 AM - +263 78 555 3504: Yes, we may proceed, thank you.
18/1/24, 10:37 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 10:37 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, I would encourage you to go through the above image representing your university admission process and once you are done, let me know so that I can explain the same to you in detail.
18/1/24, 10:42 AM - +263 78 555 3504: I have gone through it, you may begin the explaining.
18/1/24, 10:44 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
18/1/24, 10:45 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
18/1/24, 10:47 AM - +263 78 555 3504: Yes, I fully understand both explanations, thank you.
18/1/24, 10:53 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counselling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counselling session will take about 1 hour.
18/1/24, 10:53 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
18/1/24, 10:55 AM - +263 78 555 3504: Yes, I follow.
18/1/24, 10:56 AM - +263 78 555 3504: Am I the one who chooses the university I want to go to or the board does it for me?
18/1/24, 11:10 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: After the completion of your application process, the academic board will evaluate your profile and choose the best universities for your field of education. Next, they will send out your application to those universities. In case you receive an offer letter from multiple universities, you will have the option to choose one out of them. As we proceed with our sessions, you will gain more clarity on the admission and registration process. I hope this was helpful?
18/1/24, 11:10 AM - +263 78 555 3504: Yes, this answers my question. Thank you very much.
18/1/24, 11:18 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
18/1/24, 11:18 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
18/1/24, 11:21 AM - +263 78 555 3504: Is the registration fee not covered by the program?
18/1/24, 11:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I did not quite get your question, dear. Would you be kind enough to explain your concern?
18/1/24, 11:30 AM - +263 78 555 3504: The registration fee you mentioned, the one paid to secure enrollment at the chosen university. Do we pay it or Edoofa is the one that pays?
18/1/24, 11:49 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand your query now. Thank you for explaining it. The registration fee is part of your annual tuition fees. The amount you pay during registration to secure your scholarship seat will be readjusted with your annual fees. Hence, the registration fee has to be paid by you. As we proceed with our sessions, you will gain more clarity about the admission process. I hope this was helpful?
18/1/24, 11:53 AM - +263 78 555 3504: Okay, I understand now.
18/1/24, 11:53 AM - +263 78 555 3504: We may proceed.
18/1/24, 12:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
18/1/24, 12:03 PM - +263 78 555 3504: No, I don't have any queries. You already answered all the questions I had.
18/1/24, 12:04 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Thank you.
18/1/24, 12:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
18/1/24, 12:11 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Yes, we may begin.
18/1/24, 12:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
18/1/24, 12:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. You may take today’s time for the same. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?
18/1/24, 12:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?

18/1/24, 1:01 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Thank you, stay blessed.
18/1/24, 1:01 PM - +263 78 555 3504: My mother sent the documents you asked for earlier on today, did you manage to get them?
18/1/24, 1:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, dear. I have taken a note of it. Thank you for sharing the documents.
18/1/24, 1:06 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Okay, you're most welcome.
19/1/24, 8:22 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tinashe. How are you all doing today?
19/1/24, 8:26 AM - +263 78 555 3504: Good morning ma'am. We're doing well thank you, how are you today?
19/1/24, 8:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you're all doing well. I'm doing fine myself, thank you for asking dear. May I know if you were able to go through the videos in detail?
19/1/24, 8:30 AM - +263 78 555 3504: Yes, I was able to watch all the videos.
19/1/24, 8:35 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Could you kindly share your understanding of each video individually, dear?
19/1/24, 8:50 AM - +263 78 555 3504: I'm just going to summarise the key points I managed to note in each video.

In the first video, the founders urged us to be very open minded. They told us that we should be teachable in order to excel in the program. They also said we should be able to follow instructions.

In the second video, they emphasised that Edoofa's vision is not just about giving people affordable education, but it's to guide them to be more employable. They aim to bolster our capacity of success in turn making us as students self dependent and more responsible.

The founders also stressed how they spent a lot of time acquiring a number of good schools and universities. This was done over a period of ten years and they tell us this in the third video. They urged us to follow instructions again to be prepared and qualified for such institutions.

In the fourth and final video, the founders explain what the statement of purpose is. From my understanding, I managed to note that this document is important for convincing institutions to take me on as their student. They also urged us to be prompt in taking action and fill out the form.
19/1/24, 9:08 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Brilliant, you seem to have understood the founders’ message quite well! I am glad that you were able to go through the videos so thoroughly. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
19/1/24, 9:10 AM - +263 78 555 3504: Yes, we're on the same page... You may proceed.
19/1/24, 9:25 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 9:00 AM.
19/1/24, 9:25 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

20/1/24, 1:47 AM - +263 78 555 3504: <Media omitted>
20/1/24, 1:47 AM - +263 78 555 3504: <Media omitted>
20/1/24, 8:05 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tinashe. How are you all doing today?
20/1/24, 8:05 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your answers with me, dear. I have taken a note of it.
20/1/24, 8:14 AM - +263 78 555 3504: Morning ma'am, I'm good and you?
20/1/24, 8:14 AM - +263 78 555 3504: You're welcome.
20/1/24, 9:04 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counselling on university admission*.
20/1/24, 9:04 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Civil Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
20/1/24, 9:08 AM - +263 78 555 3504: Yes, that is true.
20/1/24, 9:27 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
20/1/24, 9:27 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
20/1/24, 9:27 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
20/1/24, 9:27 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
20/1/24, 9:39 AM - +263 78 555 3504: Yes, I am familiar with with.
20/1/24, 9:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
20/1/24, 9:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
20/1/24, 9:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee.
20/1/24, 9:43 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
20/1/24, 9:52 AM - +263 78 555 3504: Yes, he properly explained. We may move on.
20/1/24, 9:53 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
20/1/24, 10:15 AM - +263 78 555 3504: Yes, we are. You may continue.
20/1/24, 10:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
20/1/24, 10:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*

Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
20/1/24, 10:29 AM - +263 78 555 3504: Yes, I have. Please continue.
20/1/24, 10:32 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
20/1/24, 10:39 AM - +263 78 555 3504: Okay, I understand.
20/1/24, 10:44 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
20/1/24, 10:46 AM - +263 78 555 3504: So if you want to do the monthly installment plan you have to start within the first month of arrival?
20/1/24, 10:47 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, dear. The plan will enable you to pay the remaining part of your fee in 2 installments. The first payment has to be completed within the first 3 days of your arrival, and the second payment will be due in the month of January.
20/1/24, 10:48 AM - +263 78 555 3504: Okay, I understand now.
20/1/24, 10:50 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
20/1/24, 10:50 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
20/1/24, 10:50 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
20/1/24, 10:56 AM - +263 78 555 3504: Okay, I understand.
20/1/24, 10:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.
20/1/24, 10:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
20/1/24, 11:10 AM - +263 78 555 3504: No ma'am, I do not have any queries.
20/1/24, 11:26 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
20/1/24, 11:26 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
20/1/24, 11:26 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
20/1/24, 11:26 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/1/24, 11:29 AM - +263 78 555 3504: Wow. They all look super happy.
20/1/24, 11:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, indeed Tinashe. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
20/1/24, 11:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
20/1/24, 11:43 AM - +263 78 555 3504: Yes I am, please do tell. 👀
20/1/24, 12:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000
20/1/24, 12:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
20/1/24, 12:28 PM - +263 78 555 3504: No ma'am, I believe I am not aware of the solution.
20/1/24, 12:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
20/1/24, 12:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
20/1/24, 12:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
20/1/24, 12:31 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Ohhhh, that sounds like an excellent plan.
20/1/24, 12:32 PM - +263 78 555 3504: I have no queries, I understand what you mean.
20/1/24, 12:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
20/1/24, 12:35 PM - +263 78 555 3504: No ma'am, I do not, thank you.
20/1/24, 12:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
20/1/24, 12:44 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Yes! I am over the moon about it ma'am.
20/1/24, 12:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Friday (23 January 2024).
