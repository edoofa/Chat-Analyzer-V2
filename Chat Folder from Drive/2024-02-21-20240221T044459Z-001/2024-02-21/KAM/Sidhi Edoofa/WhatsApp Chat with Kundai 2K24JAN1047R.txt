We have thoughtfully scheduled our discussion sessions within these time frames to ensure engaging and productive conversations. May I assume that you have taken note of our designated discussion hours?
23/1/24, 5:00 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Yes l have taken note of your designated discussion hours but l can assure that l will be available from 4 pm as l am going to school and we are not allowed to bring cellphones. I don't know if it's ok.
23/1/24, 5:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is quite alright Kundai. Thank you for informing me. We can have our sessions at 4:00 PM. However, to ensure a smooth progression in completing your admission process, I will need your help, and I encourage you to be actively engaged during the 1-hour period from 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM. I hope we are together in this?
23/1/24, 5:08 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Yes we are together, thank you
23/1/24, 5:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Since this is the first time we are interacting with each other, I'm eager to learn more about you. Could you kindly provide an introduction of yourself and also share details about your family, sponsor, or guardians who will play a role in shaping your educational plans?
23/1/24, 5:13 PM - +263 71 256 8023: My name is Kundai Katayi. I'm 18 years old. I wrote my O level examinations in 2022 and came out with a total
 of 11 subjects. I'm now an upper 6 student at Thornhill High School in
 Gweru. I am a commercial student doing a combination of Mathematics, Accounting
 and Economics.

 I'm really good with numbers and calculating . I like reading and playing volleyball.

I live in Clifton Park with both my parents and l have 2 older sisters and a younger brother who's doing form 3. My older sister is married and the other one is doing her 3rd year at Midlands State University. My parents are both self employed. My father is an auto electrician and my mother is a tailor. They both work in Gweru. <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 5:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Amazing. It's a pleasure to learn more about you and your family. It must be really fun having 3 other siblings. We look forward to assisting you with your educational plans here at Edoofa.

Since this is your admissions group, I believe you must have added your parents to the group. This will help them become familiar with the admission process and enable them to participate when required. Could you please confirm if they have already been added to the group?
23/1/24, 5:17 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Yes they are already in the group.
23/1/24, 5:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. May I know your parents' names and the number they would be using in this group to connect with us?
23/1/24, 5:20 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Father :Memory Katayi
Phone number :0772426991
 Mother :Sirira C Murire Katayi
0772607270
23/1/24, 5:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for this confirmation! Moving forward, I would like to bring an important aspect to your attention. The collective aim that we have for the student strongly values balanced involvement from parents, especially when the student is unable to participate. Your proactive engagement holds significant weight, and if, for any reason, either you or your guardians won't be available, we kindly request you to inform us beforehand so that we can plan and schedule our discussion beforehand. I hope you have taken note of this as well?
23/1/24, 5:22 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Yes, l  understand. I will keep you updated.
23/1/24, 5:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Fantastic! Now over the next four days, our focus as your admission team will be on equipping you with a comprehensive understanding of what lies ahead in your university admission journey and help you commence the same.
23/1/24, 5:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Soon after, we will guide you through the initiation of your EWYL Journey. The next batch of EWYL Sessions is scheduled to commence on *Tuesday (30 January)* and hence, if we are able to focus and complete the Admission Process before Saturday (27 January) with pure consistency, you will be able to start your EWYL journey as well in a timely manner.
23/1/24, 5:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly mark this date on your calendar and ensure that you are available to complete the necessary procedures within the stipulated timeline. If everything is proceeding as planned so far, shall we move forward and begin our session for the day?
23/1/24, 5:24 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Yes we may start.
23/1/24, 5:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
23/1/24, 5:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Kundai 2K24JAN1047R)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
23/1/24, 5:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Kundai EWYL23E1200)* . In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
23/1/24, 5:28 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Yes I understand. Thank you
23/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counsellor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counselling session with your counsellor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
23/1/24, 5:36 PM - +263 71 256 8023: The Edoofa Scholarship Program has impressed me in many ways. It takes great care of the edoofians and help them in understanding more about their  choice of career. It also makes education affordable to those who are economically challenged.
23/1/24, 5:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you find the program to be so helpful in terms of support and self-financing your own education.
23/1/24, 5:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moving forward with the procedures, I would like to share an insight with you. To ensure a seamless experience, we, as a team, have prepared essential documents that not only value your feedback but also outline the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program and the application process. You will have to review, complete, and submit these documents as instructed. 

If you are ready, shall I share a brief overview of these documents for your ease?
23/1/24, 5:37 PM - +263 71 256 8023: The EWYL is also quite impressive as it helps a student to be more independent.
23/1/24, 5:38 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Yes please
23/1/24, 5:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Perfect! Let's delve into the documents that are crucial for your journey with Edoofa.

*1. Feedback Form:* Your candid feedback is invaluable in our pursuit of excellence. This form offers you the chance to voice your opinions and suggestions. Hence, I have asked you to print out the feedback form. You have to fill in the same feedback form by hand and affix a passport-sized photo as indicated. Once completed, you have to scan the document or click a picture and share it with us here in your admission group. Please let me know if you have gone through the above document that I shared so that I can share the second form which is an online Google form.
23/1/24, 5:43 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Ok let me fill the form send you the pictures
23/1/24, 5:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You may take today's time to fill the forms that I am about to share and share them before tomorrow's session. I hope you are following?
23/1/24, 5:47 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Ok
23/1/24, 5:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that, now following with a second form which is an *Online Google Form*.

After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded, *please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here* so that we can cross-check our records for the same. Please let me know if you have taken note of this so that I can share the third and final form and the deadline to complete these forms.
23/1/24, 5:49 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Noted
23/1/24, 5:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Great to hear that you've taken note of the second form as well. Now, moving on to the third and final form:

*3. EWYL Program Instructions and Pledge Document:* In the form, you will find a section where you are required to specify the date on which you intend to commence your EWYL journey. The next batch is scheduled to start on *Tuesday (30 January 2024)* . If you are enthusiastic about beginning the procedures on that particular date, please fill it in accordingly. However, if you are unavailable to commence your EWYL Journey on that date, please inform us, and we will propose an alternative date for the next session. Our aim is to align this with your availability to ensure a smooth transition.

With this form that has been shared with you, I have shared all the forms you have to submit to begin your procedures, please let me know once you have taken note of them so that we can move forward.
23/1/24, 5:51 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Ok, l understand
23/1/24, 5:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Along with these forms, I had asked you to share your academic documents with us. I am currently waiting for that as well.

Moving forward, as a part of your application file, you will need to visit your school and secure a letter of recommendation from them. We have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process.
23/1/24, 5:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 5:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, *your subject combination for A Level exams*, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
23/1/24, 5:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to inquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?
23/1/24, 5:56 PM - +263 71 256 8023: I will try to get it from school tomorrow
23/1/24, 5:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that and I am looking forward to getting an update from your end. I would also like to reiterate that our operational hours are from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Central African Time.
23/1/24, 5:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Considering this, for our future sessions, you have to decide on an hour’s time that suits your availability within this timeframe and share the same with us so that we can tailor our subsequent sessions to accommodate your schedule effectively.
23/1/24, 5:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For the next couple of days, we will have sessions on a daily basis and once we cover the first three steps of the admission cycle, we will have sessions scheduled on a need basis. Hence, can you let me know at what time you would like us to schedule our sessions on a daily basis (between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM)?
23/1/24, 5:59 PM - +263 71 256 8023: 4pm to 5pm
23/1/24, 5:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. In such a case, we will schedule tomorrow’s session at this time. It's important to note that all three forms and your academic documents with the Letter of recommendation should be completed and submitted by tomorrow before our session. 

This timeline is essential to ensure a smooth progression in the admission process and to meet the goal of concluding this session before Saturday, enabling us to assist you in initiating your EWYL process on time. I hope we are together with this?
23/1/24, 6:00 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Yes, thank you
23/1/24, 6:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 4:00 PM for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to fill out all the forms and share the documents. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed rest of the day and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
23/1/24, 6:02 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Thank you
24/1/24, 4:06 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Good afternoon

24/1/24, 4:16 PM - +263 71 256 8023: I don't have a statement of entry yet.
24/1/24, 4:16 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Ok thank you
24/1/24, 4:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I notice that you have left the Orientation Availability date column empty. Allow me to help you understand it better, dear. The column "orientation availability" refers to a 3-day window following the commencement of your EWYL program, which, in your case, is on January 30. After the initiation, you will have a 3-day period during which you will commence your EWYL orientation, specifically from January 30 to February 3 in your situation. Your EWYL program initiation date remains January 30, and you are required to input a date between January 30 and February 3 for your Orientation program. It is permissible for both the EWYL Program availability and Orientation availability to share the same date. If you are available for the orientation on January 30 itself, kindly indicate so. I hope I am clear?
24/1/24, 4:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is quite alright if you do not have your statement of entry yet. In such a case, kindly refer to this sample letter of recommendation. You will be required to share the same with us in this format, with *your subject combination for A-Level examination specified*. I hope you are following Kundai?
24/1/24, 4:25 PM - +263 71 256 8023: I will be available on January 30
24/1/24, 4:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well. Then you may write the same in the form and resend the picture dear.
24/1/24, 4:28 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Ok
24/1/24, 4:30 PM - +263 71 256 8023: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 4:31 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Is it ok if l add it on my recommendation letter from school?
24/1/24, 4:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, you may do so. However, kindly make sure that your subject combination for A-Level examinations are clearly specified in the same. I hope you are following?
24/1/24, 4:35 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Ok
24/1/24, 4:39 PM - +263 71 256 8023: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 4:39 PM - +263 71 256 8023: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 4:41 PM - +263 71 256 8023: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 4:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the document Kundai. Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
24/1/24, 4:47 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Yes, we may start
24/1/24, 4:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 5:01 PM - +263 71 256 8023: I'm done
24/1/24, 5:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
24/1/24, 5:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
24/1/24, 5:09 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Yes they are clear
24/1/24, 5:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps - 

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
24/1/24, 5:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
24/1/24, 5:15 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Yes am following
24/1/24, 5:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
24/1/24, 5:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
24/1/24, 5:18 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Yes they are very clear
24/1/24, 5:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
24/1/24, 5:19 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Yes we may start
24/1/24, 5:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
24/1/24, 5:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?
24/1/24, 5:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
24/1/24, 5:22 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Yes l'm ready

24/1/24, 5:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kundai, I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled for tomorrow after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
24/1/24, 5:26 PM - +263 71 256 8023: I will be done tomorrow, we can have our session from 4-5pm, thank you
24/1/24, 5:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 4:00 PM for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to fill out all the forms. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed night and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
24/1/24, 5:29 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Ok. Thank you
25/1/24, 4:25 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Good afternoon 

I went through all the videos and l learnt and had a better understanding of the processes l have to take. 

I  learnt that l should follow instructions and do what asked of me. I should be coachable enough and communicate realIy well with my counsellor. Ishould also be open minded and think out of the box.

I also learnt that EDOOFA's vision is not just  affordable but also gives  quality education to students. Edoofa helps in making students employable through the SEELS program. It also helps students to become independent and responsible.


 EDOOFA has invested over 10years to identify good schools, colleges and universities for its students .  It encourages students to be prepared and be qualified for these  institutions by having good results. Writing a statement of purpose is very vital as it helps in securing a good scholarship.

It helps students in creating a good  impression and to convince the admission board that I'm worthy of a scholarship. These steps are very important and Edoofians should follow them so that they can secure the scholarship. <This message was edited>
25/1/24, 5:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kundai. I hope you are all doing well today. I apologize for the delay in my response as I was in an urgent work-related meeting.

Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
25/1/24, 5:23 PM - +263 71 256 8023: It's ok, l understand
25/1/24, 5:24 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Yes
25/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Glad to hear that Kundai.

So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow before our session.
25/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

26/1/24, 4:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kundai.
26/1/24, 4:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 4:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: On this auspicious note, I would like to check in on you and your family. How are you all doing today?

26/1/24, 4:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well Kundai. I will be waiting for you to share your answers and screenshot with me.
26/1/24, 4:34 PM - +263 71 256 8023: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 4:36 PM - +263 71 256 8023: 2. The relationship between entrepreneurship and economic development.


Entrepreneurship is the creation or extraction of economic value in ways that that generally entail beyond the minimal amount of risk and involving values besides simply economic ones. Entrepreneurship is the process of setting up a business.


Economic development is the process by which the economic well-being and quality of life of a nation are improved according to targeted goals and objectives. 


Successful innovative entrepreneurship can result in the generation of profits, which can be reinvested in further research and development, expansion or new ventures. The cycle of wealth creation, reinvestment, and spending stimulates economic growth. Entrepreneurship promotes economic development, provides access to goods and services and improves the overall standard of living.

Enterprenuership contributes to economic development by promoting competition which encourages businesses to improve their products and services nd and to innovate which leads to a better allocation of resources and more efficient economy.
26/1/24, 4:36 PM - +263 71 256 8023: 3. Please share your understanding about GAAP and its importance 

The generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP) are a set of accounting rules, standards and procedures issued and frequently revised by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. 


GAAP compliance makes the financial reporting process transparent and standardizes assumptions, technology, definitions and methods.

The GAAP helps make financial statements usable and consistent. It eliminates confusion from financial statements and brings a sense of trust among the stakeholders. The GAAP helps significantly reduce instances of company's data misrepresentation and fraud.

The GAAP help to measure the performance of the management of an entity. It can help to measure management's ability to increase profitability, maintain the solvency of the firm and other such important financial duties of the management.
26/1/24, 4:37 PM - +263 71 256 8023: 4.What are Accounting Standards and why are they mandatory.

Accounting Standards are authoritative standards for financial reporting and are the reporting and are the primary source of the GAAP. Accounting standards specify how transactions and other events are to be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in financial statements.

Some examples of accounting are segment reporting , goodwill accounting, an allowable method for depriciation, business combination, lease classification, a  measure of outstanding share and revenue recognition.


Accounting Standards are needed to ensure that products and materials are tailored made for their purpose promote the interoperability of products and services. They facilitate trade  barriers, promote common understanding of a product. 

Mandatory safety standards are made for products that are likely to be especially hazardous. The government protects consumers by specifying minimum requirements they products must meet before they are supplied.
26/1/24, 4:37 PM - +263 71 256 8023: 5.Please differentiate between accounting and auditing. 

Accounting is the systematic way or art of recording business transactions in the correct books of accounting. Accounting measures the results of an organization's economic activity and conveys this information to a variety of stakeholders.

Auditing attempts to ensure that the books of accounting are properly maintained by the concern as required by law. Auditors consider the proportions before them, obtain evidence and evaluate the propositions in their auditing report. 

Accounting focuses on recording and presenting all financial statements and transactions. While auditing focuses on verifying the accuracy of the financial statements and judging if the financial statements genuinely represent the financial position of a business. 

While accounting translates to a much wider field, encompassing everything, including the flow  of money from the organization to the management of the company auding is more of a specialized service. Auding is part of the accounting world.

In conclusion, accounting is the process of recording and presenting financial information, while auditing is the independent examination of that information to ensure its accuracy and reliability. Accounting is a broader field that encompasses various tasks, while auding is a specialized service within the accounting profession.

26/1/24, 4:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the answers, dear. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Tuesday (30 January 2024).
26/1/24, 4:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Tuesday, as previously agreed upon.

To kick start the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:
26/1/24, 4:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: https://chat.whatsapp.com/GZBfewHfpAp0CT3Nnhl4QS

Kundai EWYL23E1200
26/1/24, 4:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Use the above-provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Katayi Kundai, and my EWYL group name is Kundai EWYL23E1200. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on 30/01/2024 to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
26/1/24, 4:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is* _________ *and he/she has scheduled my session for* ________. (mention the date)
26/1/24, 4:45 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Ok thank you
26/1/24, 5:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey, i.e. *Introduction to Financial Secure Plan*.
26/1/24, 5:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, before we start the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 19 February 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
26/1/24, 5:17 PM - +263 77 260 7270: Good afternoon,yes we are aware of the remaining enrollment fee.We are still preparing it .Thank you for the reminder
26/1/24, 5:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better, 

In the meantime. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BCom and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
26/1/24, 5:30 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Yes it is accurate
26/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his higher education abroad. <This message was edited>
26/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
26/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
26/1/24, 5:34 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Ok, I understand
26/1/24, 5:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
26/1/24, 5:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
26/1/24, 5:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
26/1/24, 5:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
26/1/24, 5:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
26/1/24, 5:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
26/1/24, 5:41 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Yes we would really like that
26/1/24, 5:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
26/1/24, 5:41 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Yes please
26/1/24, 5:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
26/1/24, 5:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
26/1/24, 5:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
26/1/24, 5:44 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Yes, l understand
26/1/24, 5:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
26/1/24, 5:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
26/1/24, 5:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
26/1/24, 5:55 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Yes, l understand
26/1/24, 5:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
26/1/24, 5:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
26/1/24, 5:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
26/1/24, 5:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
26/1/24, 5:56 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Yes
26/1/24, 5:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
26/1/24, 5:57 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Yes please
26/1/24, 5:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay before your due date of 19 February 2024.
26/1/24, 5:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
26/1/24, 5:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
26/1/24, 6:01 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Is $150 for every month fixed or you can pay any amount you want?
27/1/24, 11:31 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kundai. I hope you are having a lovely morning. Kindly excuse me for not being able to reply to you yesterday, as I was facing Wi-Fi issues. However, I am glad that we can reconnect today in order to further discuss the Financial Secure Plan.
27/1/24, 11:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our end goal is to ensure that you are able to save up at least $1500 by the end of 10 months. If you wish to deposit $100 in the first month, and deposit $200 the next month, that is also completely acceptable provided that you are able to give us a plan stating the amount you will be able to deposit every month. I hope this helps with your query?
29/1/24, 9:34 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kundai. I hope you are all doing well today. How is your day going so far?
29/1/24, 10:04 AM - +263 77 242 6991: Good morning Madam. We are  very well today. As Kundai's parents we are still pondering on how much can we afford to contribute since our financial position is not sound.
29/1/24, 10:23 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are all doing well. Thank you for sharing your concern with me. May I know what has caused this uncertainty?
30/1/24, 12:44 PM - +263 77 242 6991: Good afternoon Ms Siddhi Singh. I managed to pay part of the enrolment fee from money that I had served after a long time and the balance I will be able to pay before the deadline as stipulated. The monthly payment of $150 for the next 10 months will be a challenge for me because I and my wife are self employed. We do not have a fixed salary which we can budget fairly well. Our income fluctuates. Sometimes it meets our daily needs sometimes it doesn't.We depend  on clients served at that particular month and work done. So we need your assistance on this situation Madam. I really want to fulfill my daughter's educational aspirations.
30/1/24, 1:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kundai. I hope everything is well on your end. Thank you for sharing your concern with me. I understand that your monthly income is dependant on your clients. In such a case, you have the flexibility of deciding the date and amount you are willing to pay in the next 10 months. Our end goal is to ensure that by the end of the first 10 months, you are able to save $1500 for Kundai's education. However, since it is essential to maintain a track of all the payments to ensure timely and smooth progress, we will require you to let us know the amount you will be able to pay each month. Hence, you may suggest a payment plan with flexible amounts that you can pay every month, which will ultimately sum up to $1500 by the end of the 10 months. I hope you are following?
31/1/24, 9:52 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kundai. I hope you are all doing well today.

2/2/24, 5:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Thank you for letting me know. In such a case, kindly let me know when your parents will be available so that we can schedule our sessions accordingly.

In the meanwhile, may I know if you are currently available to proceed with our discussion?
2/2/24, 5:07 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Yes l am available
2/2/24, 5:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that Kundai. Before we proceed with our discussion, may I know if you were able to join your EWYL group and initiate the program as it was scheduled to begin on 30 January?
2/2/24, 5:11 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Yes
2/2/24, 5:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Were you able to connect with your mentor Kundai?
2/2/24, 5:49 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Yes l have connected with her
2/2/24, 6:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. May I know if you have any queries or thoughts related to the Financial Secure Plan?
2/2/24, 7:04 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Yes , We have been wondering if it is possible to create the account here in Zimbabwe ?
2/2/24, 8:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand your concern, Kundai. Since my operational hours have already concluded and I have had a long day, let us reconnect tomorrow to discuss the same.

I wish you a blessed night!
3/2/24, 11:38 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kundai. 

I hope you are having a lovely morning. You had shared a query regarding opening a bank account in Zimbabwe. You can definitely do the same, in fact you will be guided towards making your own bank account in the 11th month of the plan. Allow me to proceed with our discussion so that I can help you understand the plan in a better manner -
3/2/24, 11:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason for depositing money for 10 months instead of 20 months is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
3/2/24, 11:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
3/2/24, 11:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
3/2/24, 11:40 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
5/2/24, 10:07 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kundai.

I hope you all had a good weekend. I was hoping to get a response from your end, however it seems like due to some reason we were unable to connect with each other. May I know if everything is well on your end?
5/2/24, 4:55 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Good afternoon  ,Ms Siddhi l'm sorry l was at school
5/2/24, 5:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Since your school end almost at 5:00 PM, could you kindly suggest an alternate timing for our sessions when you or your parents will be available to participate?
5/2/24, 5:30 PM - +263 71 256 8023: We can start our sessions at  1630 and if that's not possible l  will ask my parents to be part of the session in the afternoon on my behalf
5/2/24, 5:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If your parents are available during the day, could you kindly let me know of a timeslot when they are available and will be able to participate in our sessions?
5/2/24, 5:49 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Ok l will talk to them and tell you the time before tomorrow
6/2/24, 10:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kundai.

I hope you are all doing well today. May I know if you were able to decide on a timeslot when we can have our sessions?
6/2/24, 2:38 PM - +263 77 242 6991: Good afternoon Madam. I can have a session with you any time from now . Advise me on the correct time.
6/2/24, 2:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Thank you for letting me know that. In such a case, may I know if 10:00 AM is a suitable timing for you?
6/2/24, 2:50 PM - +263 77 242 6991: Ok tomorrow. Today you do not have a free slot so we can discuss.
6/2/24, 3:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. In such a case, we will have our sessions at 10:00 AM from tomorrow onwards. In the meanwhile, let us proceed with our discussion today. During our previous session, we were discussing about how the plan works for the first 10 months. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
6/2/24, 3:15 PM - +263 77 242 6991: Yes let's continue.
6/2/24, 3:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
6/2/24, 3:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
6/2/24, 3:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
7/2/24, 3:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kundai.

I hope you are having a lovely day. I was hoping to get a response from your end yesterday, however it seems like due to some reason we were unable to connect with each other. Hence, I am reaching out to you to inquire if everything is well on your end?
7/2/24, 3:47 PM - +263 77 242 6991: Good afternoon. Everything is ok.
7/2/24, 3:48 PM - +263 77 242 6991: It sounds ok. Well planned.
7/2/24, 4:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
7/2/24, 4:50 PM - +263 77 242 6991: Ok I did understand the secure plan.
7/2/24, 5:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most people can discuss this with their family the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
7/2/24, 5:31 PM - +263 77 242 6991: Will discuss with family tomorrow
7/2/24, 5:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you tomorrow to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
8/2/24, 7:09 AM - +263 71 256 8023: Hello Ms Siddhi ,l am going to  a prefect's leadership camp at my school ,so l won't be available for the next four days so my parents can take part on the session on  my behalf. Tahnk you
