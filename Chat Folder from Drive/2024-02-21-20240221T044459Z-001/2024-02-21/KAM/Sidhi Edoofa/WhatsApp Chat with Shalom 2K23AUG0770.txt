29/1/24, 2:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Shalom,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa*. Recently I was having a discussion with the Academic Board. They highlighted  that you have not been able to proceed with your admission process in a timely manner, since your child is at school and you have been occupied with work. Hence, I pitched in that I will be able to help you out and take over your application profile so that together we can ensure a timely and smooth progress. Since my operational hours accommodate your timings more suitably, I will be assuming the duties of your admission officer. I am optimistic that together, we can pave the way for an auspicious beginning to your academic journey, resulting in the right career prospects and eventual success for both you and your family.
29/1/24, 2:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: On 26th of January, India celebrated its 75th Republic Day, and I want to extend warm regards to you and your family! As we mark 75 years of freedom and democracy, my heart overflows with pride for our vibrant nation. We celebrated the sacrifices of our forefathers, the strength of our unity, and the promise of a brighter tomorrow. Let's hold onto the spirit of this auspicious day, embracing the values that make India truly special. <This message was edited>
29/1/24, 2:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: On this auspicious note, I would like to extend my heartiest regards to you and your family, and I hope that just like my proud nation, we will work unitedly and make progress in your admission process to ensure that you are able to realise your dream of pursuing higher education here in India. May I know if you are currently available so that we can discuss the progress and the next steps to be taken for your admission journey.
