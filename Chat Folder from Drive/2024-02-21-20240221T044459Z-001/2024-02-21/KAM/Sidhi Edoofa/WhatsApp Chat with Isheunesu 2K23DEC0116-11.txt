29/12/23, 8:43 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
29/12/23, 8:43 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
29/12/23, 8:43 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identifying reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
29/12/23, 8:43 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
29/12/23, 8:43 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?

29/12/23, 9:08 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.

So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by 2nd Jan 6:30 PM.
29/12/23, 9:08 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

29/1/24, 2:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
29/1/24, 2:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
29/1/24, 2:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
29/1/24, 2:24 PM - +263 77 701 7502: Yes I am
29/1/24, 2:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
29/1/24, 2:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
29/1/24, 2:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
29/1/24, 2:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
29/1/24, 2:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
29/1/24, 2:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
29/1/24, 3:15 PM - +263 77 701 7502: Yes , it is
29/1/24, 3:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
29/1/24, 5:15 PM - +263 77 701 7502: Yes
29/1/24, 5:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As much as I would like to continue with our discussion, since my operational hours for the day have already concluded, I would like to reconnect with you tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the Financial Secure Plan and admission process. Until then, please take care and have a blessed day ahead!
30/1/24, 5:43 AM - +263 77 701 7502: Thank you
30/1/24, 1:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Isheunesu. I hope everything is well on your end. Before we proceed with our discussion today, I would like to check in on you and your family. How are you all doing today?
30/1/24, 1:36 PM - +263 77 701 7502: We are doing well and you
30/1/24, 1:53 PM - +263 71 745 7100: We're alright and you?
30/1/24, 2:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are all doing well. I am fine too, thank you for asking. During our last interaction, we were discussing about the Financial Secure Plan. As you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
30/1/24, 2:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
30/1/24, 2:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
30/1/24, 3:04 PM - +263 71 517 2372: We’re good and yoself? How is life treating you?
30/1/24, 3:39 PM - +263 77 701 7502: Yes
30/1/24, 4:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are all doing well. I am fine myself, thank you for asking. May I know if you were able to go through my previous messages?
30/1/24, 4:30 PM - +263 77 701 7502: Yes ,l am
30/1/24, 5:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
30/1/24, 5:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
30/1/24, 5:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
30/1/24, 5:25 PM - +263 71 745 7100: Sure
30/1/24, 6:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion, however, my operational hours for the day have concluded. Let us reconnect tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the admission process. I wish you a blessed day ahead!
30/1/24, 7:26 PM - +263 77 701 7502: Stay blessed
31/1/24, 1:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Isheunesu. I hope you are having a wonderful day. How are you all doing today?
31/1/24, 1:51 PM - +263 77 701 7502: We are doing well and you
31/1/24, 2:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am fine too, thank you for asking. In our last conversation, we were discussing about the details of the Financial Secure Plan. Moving forward in today's discussion, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
31/1/24, 2:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
31/1/24, 2:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
31/1/24, 2:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
31/1/24, 4:09 PM - +263 77 701 7502: Sure
31/1/24, 4:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
31/1/24, 4:50 PM - +263 71 745 7100: Yes,you can.
31/1/24, 5:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
31/1/24, 5:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
1/2/24, 1:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Isheunesu. I hope you are doing great today. How has your day been going so far?
1/2/24, 1:41 PM - +263 77 701 7502: Greetings ma'am,how are you today?
1/2/24, 4:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am fine, thank you for asking. Kindly excuse me for the delay in my response as our team is currently engaged in the preparations for our upcoming Zimbabwe trip in February. May I know if you were able to follow through with the details in our previous conversation?
1/2/24, 4:31 PM - +263 77 701 7502: Yes ,l was able
2/2/24, 1:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Isheunesu.

I hope you are having a wonderful day today. I apologize for not being able to respond to your message yesterday as our operational hours had concluded by then. Before we proceed with our session today, I would like to ask how you and your family are doing today?
2/2/24, 2:05 PM - +263 77 248 5316: We're doing alright and you Ma'am
2/2/24, 3:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am fine too, thank you for asking. Let us continue with our previous conversation about the Financial Secure Plan.
2/2/24, 3:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
2/2/24, 3:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
2/2/24, 3:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
2/2/24, 3:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
2/2/24, 4:51 PM - +263 77 248 5316: I see a good initiative in this
2/2/24, 5:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
2/2/24, 6:35 PM - +263 77 990 3073: Yes you are correct Ma'am
2/2/24, 8:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. As much as I would like to continue with our conversation today, my operational hours have already concluded and I have had a long day already. Let us conclude our conversation for today, and we will reconnect tomorrow to further discuss the Financial Secure Plan.

I wish you a blessed night!
2/2/24, 9:00 PM - +263 77 990 3073: Okay thank you and same with you
3/2/24, 11:40 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Isheunesu. How are you all doing this fine morning?
3/2/24, 12:46 PM - +263 71 745 7100: Fine thanks,how are you?
3/2/24, 1:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am well too, thank you for asking. In our previous conversation we were discussing the Financial Secure Plan. Allow me to proceed with our discussion -
3/2/24, 1:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
3/2/24, 1:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
3/2/24, 1:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
3/2/24, 2:05 PM - +263 71 745 7100: It is good
5/2/24, 1:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Isheunesu.

I hope you all had a great weekend. I was unable to respond to your last message as our operational hours on Saturday are from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM. Before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to ask how are you all doing today?
5/2/24, 1:20 PM - +263 77 701 7502: I am doing well, the weekend was very nice
5/2/24, 1:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. In our previous session, we had discussed what happens up until the 15th month of the plan. Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
5/2/24, 1:53 PM - +263 77 701 7502: Yes , l am
5/2/24, 2:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their family the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
6/2/24, 11:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Isheunesu.

I hope that you are all doing wonderful today. How has your day been going so far?
6/2/24, 11:59 AM - +263 77 701 7502: Hello Ma'am, so far it is nice
6/2/24, 12:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held last week, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
6/2/24, 12:15 PM - +263 77 701 7502: Yes, l am
6/2/24, 12:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Allow me to share some more interesting details about the event with you. Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
6/2/24, 12:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
6/2/24, 12:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
6/2/24, 12:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me share a glimpse of the conference with you and your family. I am certain that you too would be this excited to attend such events when he comes to India.
6/2/24, 12:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 12:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

6/2/24, 12:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 12:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me know once you are able to go through the messages about the SLICE CON, along with the images and videos shared with you. This was indeed a momentous step for all of our students, making them employable ready and giving them access to the right opportunities for their careers ahead.
6/2/24, 1:12 PM - +263 77 701 7502: I go through it, and it is desirable and so amazing
6/2/24, 1:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly, Isheunesu. Also, regarding the discussion we had the other day about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
6/2/24, 1:51 PM - +263 77 701 7502: We are still in the process
6/2/24, 1:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Could you kindly let me know by when you will be able to discuss it with your family?
7/2/24, 11:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Isheunesu

I hope this message finds you well and filled with the same excitement that's buzzing here at Edoofa! It's that time of the year again when we eagerly anticipate our annual Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare. This event holds a special place in our hearts as it brings us closer to our community, and we're counting down the days with great anticipation!
7/2/24, 11:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Just like clockwork, we're gearing up for the seminar next week, and I couldn't resist sharing our enthusiasm with you. Your presence would truly make the event all the more meaningful, guiding you on your journey to India. Hence, with immense joy, we wanted to extend the special invitation for the Meet and Greet Seminar to you and your wonderful family.
7/2/24, 11:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: And in the process of doing the same, I happened to notice that you haven't started your EWYL Program by now. In light of this, I had a discussion with Ms. Sanjana, the head of the EWYL Department, and I am happy to share that she has graciously agreed to make a special exception for you, expediting your application process.
7/2/24, 11:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As a result, I have gone ahead and created your very own dedicated EWYL Group - *Isheunesu EWYL23E1032*, adding both you and your parents to the mix. If I have missed including any other family members, they can easily join using the following link: [https://chat.whatsapp.com/Jjxkl1kKVRv7dghhRdxJ8e].

We are genuinely thrilled to witness you embark on this transformative journey, and we are rooting for your success every step of the way!

Warmest regards,
Admissions Team.
7/2/24, 12:45 PM - +263 77 701 7502: Greetings ma'am I am excited to connect with you today
7/2/24, 1:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I hope you are having a lovely day. How are things with you today?
7/2/24, 1:45 PM - +263 77 701 7502: Nice to me and you
7/2/24, 2:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Everything is well here, thank you for asking. May I know if you were able to discuss the with your family?
7/2/24, 5:44 PM - +263 77 701 7502: Yes,we were
7/2/24, 6:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Kindly share any queries or thoughts that you might have about the Financial Secure Plan.
7/2/24, 11:51 PM - +263 77 701 7502: Does this have due date or is there a chance of accrual payments
8/2/24, 1:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Isheunesu.

I hope you are all doing well. I understand your concern please, allow me to help you with it. Under the Financial Secure Plan, you will have the flexibility to select your preferred monthly payment date, and maintain consistent deposits for the next 10 months.

Additionally, if you have a surplus budget exceeding $150 in any given month, you have the option to deposit that amount, which will then be adjusted with your subsequent deposits. For instance, if you deposit $200 in March, your next payment due in April will be adjusted to $100.

I hope this was helpful?
8/2/24, 1:20 PM - +263 77 990 3073: Well explained thank you Ma'am
8/2/24, 1:21 PM - +263 77 990 3073: When are we supposed  to commence depositing the monies
8/2/24, 1:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For the current round of students, there are only 27 seats available for the students who can benefit from the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. 

Since you have been one of the most dedicated students, and I see you have great aspirations, I wanted you to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.
8/2/24, 1:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of February, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
8/2/24, 1:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
8/2/24, 1:47 PM - +263 77 990 3073: Oo noted with thanks, let me get in touch with the rest of the family  and come up with the date that is flexible to everyone. Then we will let you know
8/2/24, 2:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Discussing such matters with family is definitely important. Kindly have a discussion with your family members, and let me know once you are able to decide on a date for the monthly deposits.
8/2/24, 2:53 PM - +263 77 990 3073: Ok cool
9/2/24, 1:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Isheunesu.

I hope you are all doing great today. How has your day been going so far?
9/2/24, 1:21 PM - +263 77 990 3073: We're doing alright  and your side?
Thanks for checking on us.
9/2/24, 1:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am doing good, thank you for asking. May I know if you were able to discuss with your family and come up with a feasible deposit date for your monthly installments?
9/2/24, 1:45 PM - +263 77 990 3073: Yes we did opt for the 18th of every month
9/2/24, 1:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing these details, your commitment to securing a seat in this exclusive program is appreciated.

To proceed with the next steps, we will be sharing an official agreement detailing the specifics of the Financial Secure Plan along with its benefits. This agreement is a crucial document that outlines the terms and conditions of your participation in the program. It serves as a legal framework ensuring transparency and mutual understanding between all parties involved.
9/2/24, 1:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As we prepare to send you the agreement, we kindly request the following details to personalize the document:

1. Full Name of Parent/Guardian/Sponsor responsible for catering to the student's finances [The representative in whose name you want the agreement to be]
