20/2/24, 1:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for introducing yourself, Mr. Alec. It's a pleasure to learn more about you and your family. Moving forward, I would like to bring an important aspect to your attention. The collective aim that we have for the student strongly values balanced involvement from parents, especially when the student is unable to participate. Your proactive engagement holds significant weight, and if, for any reason, either you or your guardians won't be available, we kindly request you to inform us beforehand so that we can plan and schedule our discussion beforehand. I hope you have taken note of this as well?
20/2/24, 1:03 PM - +263 77 305 8214: Well noted Ms Siddhi.
20/2/24, 1:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two WhatsApp groups to connect with the team:
20/2/24, 1:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Keren 2K24FEB0546)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
20/2/24, 1:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Keren EWYL23E1309)* . In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
20/2/24, 1:10 PM - +263 77 305 8214: Yes, it is quite clear and well understood.
20/2/24, 1:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
20/2/24, 1:12 PM - +263 77 305 8214: Am ready, we can start.
20/2/24, 1:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/2/24, 1:23 PM - +263 77 305 8214: I am done, I think you can take me through each stage. Thank you
20/2/24, 1:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
20/2/24, 1:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
20/2/24, 1:29 PM - +263 77 305 8214: I think it's clear Ms Siddhi.
20/2/24, 1:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps -

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
20/2/24, 1:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
20/2/24, 1:35 PM - +263 77 305 8214: Yes you can go ahead, am following.
20/2/24, 1:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
20/2/24, 1:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
20/2/24, 1:40 PM - +263 77 305 8214: It is clear, however, kindly elaborate on the Financial Secure Plan. How does it work?
20/2/24, 1:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Financial Secure Plan is payment plan curated by the Edoofa Management to help the students and their parents a smooth application process. We will discuss the details about how the Financial Secure Plan works during our upcoming sessions. In the meanwhile, shall we proceed with our discussion?
20/2/24, 1:45 PM - +263 77 305 8214: Noted, we can proceed.
20/2/24, 1:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
20/2/24, 1:54 PM - +263 77 305 8214: Yes please, go ahead.
20/2/24, 1:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
20/2/24, 1:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
20/2/24, 1:57 PM - +263 77 305 8214: You can share Ms Siddhi.
20/2/24, 2:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/2/24, 2:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/2/24, 2:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/2/24, 2:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/2/24, 2:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled for tomorrow after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
20/2/24, 2:08 PM - +263 77 305 8214: I think I will be able to go through all of them tomorrow. Let's schedule our next session for Thursday. I suggest we have a 2 hour session to compensate for tomorrow. Same starting time. What do you think.
20/2/24, 2:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We have structured the sessions for each day in a manner that ensures there is no overwhelming amount of information being presented at once. In such a case, if you will be able to go through the videos by tomorrow, we can schedule our next session for a later time during the day so that you can get ample time to go through the videos. May I know if that would be suitable for you?
20/2/24, 2:21 PM - +263 77 305 8214: That's fine. I can confirm that I will be available as from 3pm tomorrow. However, we can go back to our normal starting time on Thursday.
Thank you
20/2/24, 2:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Most definitely, sir. Let us reconnect at 3:00 PM for tomorrow and from Thursday onwards we will connect at 12:00 PM. 

I hope by then you will be able to go through the videos. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed day ahead and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
20/2/24, 2:29 PM - +263 77 305 8214: Thank you Ms Siddhi. I would like to comment you for such an interactive session. Thank you.
20/2/24, 2:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your kind words sir.
