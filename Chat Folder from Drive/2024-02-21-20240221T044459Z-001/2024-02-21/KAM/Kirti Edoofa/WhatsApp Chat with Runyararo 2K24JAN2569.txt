I liked the Edoofians' testimonials especially for Valerie's testimonial- "Rising to the top- An Edoofians Journey of Accomplishment".
She took us from the start of the Edoofian Journey, the internship options and how they help the student's financial plan to contribute towards fees and pursue further studies - the benefits of the EWYL. It was quite impressive.
Every morning our counsellor generously lighted our spirits through motivational quotes. It grabbed our attention and made our day enjoyable and willing to be part of the Edoofa's journey.
Edoofa's affordability towards higher education and the guarantee of employment after quality studies are mainly the key aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program that have particularly impressed me thus far.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
7/2/24, 3:53 PM - +263 77 717 1803: We can start our discussion .
7/2/24, 3:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
7/2/24, 4:05 PM - +263 77 717 1803: I have gone through the image. You can proceed by explaining in detail
7/2/24, 4:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
7/2/24, 4:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
7/2/24, 4:28 PM - +263 77 717 1803: Yes they are clear.
7/2/24, 4:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
7/2/24, 4:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
7/2/24, 4:30 PM - +263 77 717 1803: Yes l am following
7/2/24, 4:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
7/2/24, 4:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
7/2/24, 4:35 PM - +263 77 717 1803: Well clarified Mrs Kirti.
7/2/24, 4:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
7/2/24, 4:41 PM - +263 77 717 1803: I am still available for further discussion.You can start.
7/2/24, 4:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
7/2/24, 4:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?
7/2/24, 4:53 PM - +263 78 483 1208: Yes.
7/2/24, 4:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me share the videos with you now
7/2/24, 4:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

8/2/24, 4:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It sounds like you had a busy day preparing for the upcoming poultry project. Cleaning and disinfecting the structures is a crucial step for the well-being of the poultry. Your dedication to the task is commendable, and I hope the project goes smoothly. In that case, we can surely connect tomorrow afternoon same time.
8/2/24, 5:43 PM - +263 78 483 1208: Thank you for understanding.
8/2/24, 6:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, have a blessed night ahead.
9/2/24, 12:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Runyararo,

I trust you're well. I'm following up regarding the message I shared with you above, since we were not able to continue with our discussion may I know if you are available to connect with us now and if you were able to go through the videos by now?
9/2/24, 12:25 PM - +263 78 483 1208: I was able to go through the videos . I will share my summary shortly.
9/2/24, 12:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. I shall wait for your response for the summary of the videos.
9/2/24, 1:07 PM - +263 78 483 1208: Ok .
9/2/24, 2:44 PM - +263 78 483 1208: The videos are illustrating an Edoofian Journey towards greater success.They have given a detailed structure necessary for an Edoofian to follow and gain the knowledge to pursue affordable and higher education.

In the first video titled "Importance Message from Edoofa's founders", they shared on the experiences they had in Africa- understanding the African community leading ideas on how they can uplift the potential African student facing challenges to pursue higher education.And that's Edoofa.
9/2/24, 2:44 PM - +263 78 483 1208: Edoofa's vision is not just to get students affordable quality education and making students employable through the SEELS program but it's also focused on increasing students capacity for success thus making students more responsible and independent. 
Edoofa is an important and authentic agent. It provides and assist in university admission making the work easier.Edoofa has invested a lot of time ( over 10 years) to identify good schools, colleges and university for passionate Edoofians. Founders encourage students to follow instructions so as to prepare and be qualified for these prestigious institution
9/2/24, 2:44 PM - +263 78 483 1208: Lastly, the videos clearly explained about the SOP (statement of purpose).The founders signified the document as a unique opportunity to convince the admission board your eligibility status. It includes your solid archievements, visions, academic goals and why you are seeking admission in that particular institution ( university)
9/2/24, 3:02 PM - +263 78 483 1208: I was kindly asking for the particular form needed to be filled. The founder's request from the videos.
9/2/24, 3:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please as we move ahead with the next step now I shall share the same with you.
9/2/24, 3:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
9/2/24, 3:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
9/2/24, 3:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
9/2/24, 3:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
9/2/24, 3:14 PM - +263 78 483 1208: Thank you for the detailed information.
9/2/24, 3:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
9/2/24, 3:16 PM - +263 78 483 1208: Yes we are on the same page.
9/2/24, 3:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 10:00 am. <This message was edited>
9/2/24, 3:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

10/2/24, 2:43 PM - +263 78 483 1208: <Media omitted>
12/2/24, 5:57 AM - +263 78 483 1208: *What skills do you need to be an Aerospace engineer:*

Aerospace engineering is dynamic, a multidisciplinary field combining principles from various engineering disciplines such as mechanical, electrical and material engineering. It is constantly evolving with new sophisticated technologies, challenges and opportunities and aerospace engineers have mastered special skills to keep up with the latest trends and innovations in aerospace engineering.
To become a qualified aerospace engineer, there are numerous skills needed to be learned which are technically, analytically and business related. With regard to the technical skills, l need to have a solid foundation in applied mathematics, physics and engineering principles.This will enable my problem solving skills.l need to be proficient in using various software tools and platforms essential for modelling simulation, analysis and optimization of aerospace systems. Other than my technical skills, l need to have soft skills. These are skills like communicating, flexibility and writing. It allows me to share ideas to other engineers l work with in the same spectrum and writing articles on any working project. 
After designing , developing ,testing and modifying our aircrafts, they need to be on aviation markets.As a result l should also have the skills to study the behaviour of market trends and the demanding companies for profitability.
12/2/24, 5:58 AM - +263 78 483 1208: *How are theories of aerodynamics used in the aerospace engineering field:*

The theories of aerodynamics have impacted positively to the aerospace engineering field. This theory, the study of forces and the resulting motion of objects through the air, plays a pivotal role in aircraft design, flight performance and safety measures.The design of systems such as the control surfaces, landing gears, and even the aircrafts overall shape are all influenced by aerodynamics. One of the crucial part of an aircraft design is the wing. This design was obtained after applying the theories of aerodynamics such as the Bernoulli's principle. The wing is  designed to generate lift. It is in the shape of airfoil. So what happens it creates an imbalance in pressure distribution by causing air to flow at different speeds above and below the wing. When the airspeed is lower below the wing than above the wing,  a pressure difference is applied. As a result an upward thrust will cause the aircraft to lift counteracting the opposing weight of the Airbus.
12/2/24, 6:00 AM - +263 78 483 1208: *Can you describe some of the lift augmentation devices used in an aircraft:*

A lift augumentation devices is a part installed on the wing if an aircraft to produce an increase in lift at a given speed. They are normally useful at low speed because it reduce the stall speed. The most common and significant high lift devices are flaps and slats.

Slats are extendable high lift devices on the leading edge( attached to the front)   of some fixed wing  aircraft.When extended into the airflow the slats increase the camber of the airfoil whichever increases the coefficient of lift. So, it allows the aircraft to stall at a higher angle of attack .As a result it reduces the take off distance.
Flaps are usually mounted on the wing trailing edges of a fixed-wing aircraft.Their adjustable position allows also to generate lift at low speeds. Other than reducing takeoff they are also used to reduce the landing distance through producing more drag allowing a steeper descent angle without increasing your airspeed on landing.
12/2/24, 6:01 AM - +263 78 483 1208: *What are the main areas of aviation:*

The main areas of aviation include commercial aviation, military aviation, general aviation and aerospace engineering. Aerospace engineering is a special branch of engineering that designs, develop and test aircrafts and spacecrafts. There are two main branches in aerospace and these are aeronautical(deals with aircraft that soar within the atmosphere) and astronautical( deals with spacecrafts, satellites and other machines that explore within the space).

Commercial aviation involves the operation of airlines and transportation of passengers and cargo.It includes national ,regional and international airlines. The most common airbuses are Boeing and Airbuses. The most signicant trustees in aviation industry.

Military aviation focuses on the use of aircraft for military purposes such as defense and combat.The aircrafts are mainly designed for navigation, surveillance and are capable in fighting wars through firing missiles to targeted zones.

General aviation encompass private and recreational flying including activities like private aircraft ownership , flight training and recreational flying.
12/2/24, 12:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Runyararo.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for submitting the SOP form, and the academic interview questions however, one question is to be answered so may I know by when will you be able to share question 1?

Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*"
12/2/24, 6:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: "Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________"
12/2/24, 6:32 PM - +263 78 483 1208: Noted
12/2/24, 6:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
12/2/24, 6:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
12/2/24, 6:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course B.Tech (Aerospace Engineering) for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
12/2/24, 6:37 PM - +263 78 483 1208: Yes
12/2/24, 6:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
12/2/24, 7:03 PM - +263 78 483 1208: Yes.
12/2/24, 7:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
12/2/24, 7:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
12/2/24, 7:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
12/2/24, 7:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
12/2/24, 7:20 PM - +263 78 483 1208: Yes Mrs Kirti
12/2/24, 7:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
12/2/24, 7:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
12/2/24, 7:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
12/2/24, 7:52 PM - +263 78 483 1208: Yes
12/2/24, 7:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2700 to $3700 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
12/2/24, 7:58 PM - +263 78 483 1208: Yes
12/2/24, 8:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
12/2/24, 8:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $2600 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $2600 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $3600 per annum*

Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $3600). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
12/2/24, 8:40 PM - +263 78 483 1208: Yes.
12/2/24, 8:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $3600 as per the above example.
12/2/24, 8:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $3600- $1000 = $2600. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1300 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1300 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
12/2/24, 8:52 PM - +263 78 483 1208: Noted Mrs Kirti
12/2/24, 8:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
12/2/24, 8:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
12/2/24, 8:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
12/2/24, 9:01 PM - +263 78 483 1208: Noted
12/2/24, 9:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
12/2/24, 9:51 PM - +263 78 483 1208: Your explanations were well clarified. All my queries were answered.
12/2/24, 9:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
12/2/24, 9:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
12/2/24, 9:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/2/24, 10:04 PM - +263 78 483 1208: I would like to give thanks on the important information you gave through my counseling session on University admission and the associated costs. I am well informed.Right now l am extremely looking forward for the offer letter to make my Edoofian Journey a success.
12/2/24, 10:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
12/2/24, 10:11 PM - +263 78 483 1208: I excited. What's the news
12/2/24, 10:11 PM - +263 78 483 1208: *l'm
12/2/24, 10:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
12/2/24, 10:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
12/2/24, 10:13 PM - +263 78 483 1208: I am not aware of the solution.
12/2/24, 10:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
12/2/24, 10:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
12/2/24, 10:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for February 15, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before February 15, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by March 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?

Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?

12/2/24, 10:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.

18/2/24, 6:47 AM - +263 77 717 1803: Good Morning Ms Kirti.  It's Joseph Dafi, RUNYARARO DAFI's father.  We were in Harare yesterday, at Martin Luther King Junior School.  What a Team you have!  It was a great day.  We interacted, we shared a lot about Edoofa and the future of our higher education for our son's and daughters.  We received the Offer letter from LPU.  We were on the bus, a few minutes away from the venue.  We did not have enough time to analyze it; but we were excited to receive the Offer Letter.  However, Ms Kirti, my main concern at the moment after yesterday and even before, is that I SINCERELY REQUEST that you change Runyararo's course to MECHANICAL ENGINEERING.  He can always choose a specialised field when he completes his Mechanical Engineering.  I raised this with your Admissions Team and they asked me to talk to you about it.  One of the Team members was Mr Austin Bapu.  I did not get the business card for the other one; but they were both a great team.  Please Ms Kirti, do the best for my son.  Let me leave it here for now and wait for your response first.  I still have some issues to raise with you, our Counsellor, especially after yesterday's interaction with other parents, the Edoofa Team and other Edoofians.  Thank you.

19/2/24, 8:17 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Runyararo.

I hope you are doing well, I am pleased to hear about your time and experience during the meet and greet Indeed Mr. Austin updated me about your request personally as well. Before answering your concern, I would like to know what other issue you wish to inquire about?
19/2/24, 8:51 AM - +263 77 717 1803: Good Morning Ms Kirti
Thank you for the quick response.  I was pleasantly surprised when a cousin said that he is at Chandigarh University, apparently in the same State.  Is it possible to get a seat there?  I noticed on the Offer Letter that Accomodation/Residential was said to be "not opted", what does that mean?  As I was interacting with other parents they were talking about 70%, 80%, 90% and even 100% scholarship.  Ours from LPU was 50%, not in any way complaining Ms Kirti but wondering whether we could be lifted from the 50% without compromising quality.  Just mere concerns as a parent but I know you will always do the best for us and Runyararo.  Thank you.
19/2/24, 12:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concerns, let me help you understand them one by one, coming back to your concern regarding sharing Runyararo's application with LPU University and not with Chandigarh University. Let me inform you that LPU University is one of the best universities in India. Since you mentioned CU yourself I understand that it is easy for you to fall in love with what you see on the internet. I am sure with your research, you must have noticed that India is a country that has over 850 universities, and every university has its own eligibility criteria.
19/2/24, 12:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is practically impossible for us to apply to all these universities, so once the admission file of the student is ready, we handpick the university based on the ranking, its quality of education, its quality of teachers, practical exposure, etc. which actually would be a right fit for the students and then we share the application with them.

Now, if students have the same freedom, the only problem is that the information that the students receive is only from the internet and the internet is a place where everyone has the freedom to write and claim anything. You would often find that universities are mentioned as top universities, whereas in reality, it is not so.
19/2/24, 12:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Being Indians, we are connected with the Ministries, and Education Board where we have the rankings and information of the universities, and based on that we recommend. 

Whereas sometimes who is sitting 1000 miles away, the only source of information would be the internet and we do not want a situation where you later complain about the quality.
19/2/24, 12:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You know there was recently a case regarding the Chandigarh University girls' hostel and huge protests erupted after disturbing news emerged from the girl's hostel that private videos of several hostel girls were secretly recorded in the hostel bathroom and were circulated on the internet. 

I am sure being an outsider, you might not be familiar with it. When we know all this about the university and the management working there, there is no way we can ever think of partnering with such universities and sending our students over there. I hope you understand the same now?
19/2/24, 1:55 PM - +263 78 483 1208: Noted Mrs Kirti. Currently my father's phone is not online. He is in town with the phone but in a couple of minutes he will be online to give you his response basing on the concerns.

Thank you.
19/2/24, 2:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, I will be waiting for his response.
19/2/24, 3:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon,
I hope you are doing well,

Please excuse me for being unavailable for the session today, 
I have an urgent family emergency because of this I will not be able to continue the sessions for the next few days.

I will drop a message in the group as soon as I am available. 

*Be assured that your admissions process will not be hampered, and I will commence the same on priority once I come back*
20/2/24, 7:58 AM - +263 77 717 1803: Good Morning Ms Kirti
Thank you for your response.  We believe you and really understand that you will do the best for us and our son.  We look forward to your return.  
(Joseph Dafi)
