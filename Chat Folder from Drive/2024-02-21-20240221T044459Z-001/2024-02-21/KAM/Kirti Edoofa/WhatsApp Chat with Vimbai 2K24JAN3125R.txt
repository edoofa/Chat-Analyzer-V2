16/2/24, 8:59 AM - +263 71 838 9027: <Media omitted>

16/2/24, 9:02 AM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>

16/2/24, 9:06 AM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/2/24, 9:06 AM - +263 71 838 9027: Thank you so much madam so the date of the exam won't change?
16/2/24, 9:08 AM - Kirti Edoofa: It will be on the same date as mentioned in the poster.
16/2/24, 9:12 AM - +263 71 838 9027: I've analysed the cycle madam
16/2/24, 9:13 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
16/2/24, 9:13 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
16/2/24, 9:16 AM - +263 71 838 9027: Yes I'm seeing them
16/2/24, 9:17 AM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
16/2/24, 9:17 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
16/2/24, 9:19 AM - +263 71 838 9027: Yes I'm following
16/2/24, 9:20 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
16/2/24, 9:20 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
16/2/24, 9:22 AM - +263 71 838 9027: Yes , very clear Ms Kirti
16/2/24, 9:23 AM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
16/2/24, 9:28 AM - +263 71 838 9027: Yes , let's proceed
16/2/24, 9:31 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
16/2/24, 9:31 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?
16/2/24, 9:34 AM - +263 71 838 9027: Yes
16/2/24, 9:34 AM - Kirti Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
16/2/24, 9:34 AM - +263 71 838 9027: Yes I'm ready
16/2/24, 9:54 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me share the videos with you now.
16/2/24, 9:55 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

16/2/24, 9:55 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
16/2/24, 9:55 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
16/2/24, 9:55 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding.

19/2/24, 9:46 AM - +263 71 838 9027: Ok ,on the first video I learnt about the students who did the EWYL program and earned scholarship credits .and how they benefited from the program
The second one tells us about how the Edoofa program is different from the rest, it tells us that universities under Edoofa benefit a lot because they will get employed after graduating from the university.
The third one talks about universities and colleges.it tells us about great experiences from the university and colleges and how students are interacting
The fourth one is about the statement of purpose, it clears all the doubt of the parents as it explains all about the scholarship attachment to the universities and colleges.
19/2/24, 9:46 AM - +263 71 838 9027: That is what I understand from the videos
19/2/24, 9:47 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
19/2/24, 9:47 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
19/2/24, 9:47 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
19/2/24, 9:47 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.

19/2/24, 9:53 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 01:30 PM.
19/2/24, 9:53 AM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

I was able to make sure that the  classroom was tidy before and after school .Also , I'm the first born in a family of 3 children. So I am able to manage and see how my siblings are participating at school and assisting them on doing house chore . Some times my parents my leave the house to attend business meetings or family gatherings . I will be the one to manage the security and the day to day occasions at home.
