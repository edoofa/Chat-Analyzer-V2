26/12/23, 12:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa added you
12/1/24, 5:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Nokutenda,

I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
12/1/24, 5:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
12/1/24, 5:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
12/1/24, 6:38 PM - +263 78 272 0741: Wow congratulations 👏
12/1/24, 6:38 PM - +263 78 272 0741: Thank you, compliments for the new year to you too
12/1/24, 6:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome and thank you. With great excitement and pride, I also want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
12/1/24, 6:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
12/1/24, 6:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we discuss your admission journey further, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

12/1/24, 7:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing to hear your thoughts. We also had the pleasure of conversing with some of our students who expressed their joy upon receiving their A-Level results.

Reflecting on my own school days, I vividly recall the mix of excitement and anticipation surrounding the result day. It is an important moment that shapes the path of one’s academic journey.
12/1/24, 7:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
12/1/24, 7:58 PM - +263 78 272 0741: Indeed ma'am and the curiosity to know what you came out with and the adrenaline rush
12/1/24, 7:59 PM - +263 78 272 0741: It seems someone tried to open the results for me hence l'm unable to view them l will have to check them from my school on Monday
12/1/24, 8:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Surely you can share the result on Monday.
12/1/24, 8:07 PM - +263 78 272 0741: Yes ma'am
12/1/24, 8:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In that case, let us reconnect on Monday when you share your results with us so that we can move forward with your admission process. Have a blessed night and weekend ahead.
12/1/24, 8:10 PM - +263 78 272 0741: Thank you have a blessed night and weekend as well

15/1/24, 8:42 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Nokutenda.

I'm sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will promptly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
15/1/24, 8:52 AM - +263 78 272 0741: Thank you ma'am..

But l wanted to change my program l want to study cyber security and forensic auditing or computer science so l wanted to know the fee structures of the programs
15/1/24, 9:36 AM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, thank you for letting me know that, may I know why do you wish to change your course all of a sudden?
15/1/24, 9:43 AM - +263 78 272 0741: I realized that the program l chose is not a good fit for me  because the subject matter is not as interesting as l thought it would be or because l might find it too difficult to excel in due to my results in Accounting.l discovered a new passion and interest that l want to pursue instead. For one, the job market for both cyber security professionals and forensic auditors is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years. This means that there will be many opportunities for those who have the necessary skills and training.Cyber security professionals work to protect the world's digital infrastructure from attack, while forensic auditors help to uncover fraud and other financial crimes.


Hence I decided to change my program ma'am. <This message was edited>
15/1/24, 10:46 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for stating your reasons really well. May I know if your parents support you as well?

15/1/24, 11:23 AM - +263 78 272 0741: I understand ma'am.
15/1/24, 11:24 AM - Kirti Edoofa: @263782720741 so may I know if this course aligns with your career aspiration?
15/1/24, 11:25 AM - +263 78 272 0741: Yes it does
15/1/24, 11:26 AM - +263 78 272 0741: But isn't there a course that will help me learn forensic auditing?
15/1/24, 12:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Nokutenda I believe you are confused here, let me help you understand better. Forensic Auditing which you are referring to is a specified branch of Bcom, the course which has been given to you. If you wish to pursue Forensic auditing you will have to continue with Bcom since it will be making the right base for you. 

However, here you mentioned that you developed an interest in computers over time so I am not sure about your clarity?
15/1/24, 12:23 PM - +263 78 272 0741: Yes ma'am my interest is in computers now so l wanted to know if there is a course that will include both computers and forensic auditing like Bcom in cyber security and forensic auditing
15/1/24, 12:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that however, I am sure you are also smart enough to understand that you will not be able to get two different fields in one course right? What you can do is choose your major for now which you are more inclined to and you can chose your minor in the second year of your university, the university gives you that liberty to chose your minor in your second year of education.
15/1/24, 12:51 PM - +263 78 272 0741: I will go with the Bcom in computer science ma'am.
15/1/24, 12:52 PM - +263 78 272 0741: Thank you for elaborating the courses for me
15/1/24, 12:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, however, I am confused here do you mean BCOM or BCA? as there is no such course called bcom in computer science?
15/1/24, 12:54 PM - +263 78 272 0741: Typing error ma'am l wanted to type BCA
15/1/24, 12:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It Is alright please, I understand. Thank you for sharing the confirmation with me here. Now, on that note, please write a mail to "*academicboard@edoofa.com*" stating that you had a discussion with your admission officer Ms. Kirti about changing your course from BCOM to BCA for the intake 2024 and that you have finalized the same for yourself.

Please also mention your admission group name in the mail once done please share the screenshot with us so that we can even update the records <This message was edited>
15/1/24, 12:55 PM - +263 78 272 0741: Okay ma'am
15/1/24, 12:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I shall wait for your response.
15/1/24, 12:59 PM - +263 78 272 0741: Ma'am l wanted to know the fee structure of the course first so that l'll know if my mother will be able to pay for it or not
15/1/24, 1:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Nokutenda, we will be proceeding with the next steps as well since we tried connecting with you in the month of September but there was no response that time and that is why you were not able to move ahead with your admissions that time, however, now that we can connect we will move ahead with the steps ahead.
15/1/24, 1:01 PM - +263 78 272 0741: Alright ma'am I understand now
15/1/24, 1:52 PM - +263 78 272 0741: <Media omitted>
15/1/24, 1:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the screenshot with me, it is duly noted with us.
15/1/24, 2:04 PM - +263 78 272 0741: You're welcome ma'am.
15/1/24, 2:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelors in Computer Application for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
15/1/24, 2:21 PM - +263 78 272 0741: Yes ma'am
15/1/24, 2:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/1/24, 2:24 PM - +263 78 272 0741: Thank you for reminding me
15/1/24, 2:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
15/1/24, 2:29 PM - +263 78 272 0741: Yes, I can definitely share my understanding of the university admission. First, student need to search for their desired university and program and then begin the application process. The application process includes uploading required documents such as recommendation letters, and a statement of purpose. Once all of the required documents have been uploaded, students can submit their application. After their application has been submitted, students will be notified of the decision made by the university.
15/1/24, 2:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
15/1/24, 2:36 PM - +263 78 272 0741: I don't think I have queries
15/1/24, 2:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
15/1/24, 2:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
15/1/24, 2:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
15/1/24, 2:40 PM - +263 78 272 0741: Yes we're excited ma'am.
15/1/24, 2:40 PM - +263 78 272 0741: Thank you ma'am.
15/1/24, 2:41 PM - +263 78 272 0741: We're grateful to the board as proud Edoofians
15/1/24, 3:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
15/1/24, 3:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.
15/1/24, 3:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
15/1/24, 4:03 PM - +263 78 272 0741: I have reviewed them we can now discuss them in detail
15/1/24, 4:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
15/1/24, 4:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
15/1/24, 4:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
15/1/24, 4:27 PM - +263 78 272 0741: This is understandable ma'am so the university will do the evaluation in connection with the board right,!
15/1/24, 4:34 PM - +263 78 272 0741: Yes this is a great opportunity
15/1/24, 4:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
15/1/24, 4:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
15/1/24, 4:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
15/1/24, 4:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I did not understand you well here, may I know if you could elaborate on your concern here?
15/1/24, 5:00 PM - +263 78 272 0741: Yes it does make sense ma'am l understand clearly
15/1/24, 5:00 PM - +263 78 272 0741: I was asking if it's the university that will decide my scholarship percentage or it's the board.
15/1/24, 9:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, kindly excuse me I was occupied with a meeting today and hence I could not move ahead with the discussion with you. Let us plan to reconnect tomorrow so that we can continue with our discussion as planned. Have a blessed night and do convey my regards to your family as well.
16/1/24, 9:07 PM - +263 78 272 0741: Greetings Ms Kirti, kindly excuse me for failing to connect with you today we're having electricity and network challenges.
24/1/24, 12:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Nokutenda,

I trust you're all having a good day. I want to start by apologizing for my absence over the past week. Unfortunately, I was unwell with a severe ENT infection, which required me to rest as per my doctor's advice. Thankfully, I'm feeling much improved now and am eager to reconnect with you so we can continue our discussions. But before we proceed, I'm curious to hear about how your last week went?
24/1/24, 1:23 PM - +263 78 272 0741: Good afternoon Ms Kirti.

I'm having a good day, l'm also eager to reconnect with you and l wish you a speedy recovery.

The past week was a good week because I got to learn about the book wrote by Napoleon Hill tittled "Think and Grow Rich."How was yours?
24/1/24, 5:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your kind wishes for a speedy recovery. I'm glad to hear that you're having a good day and that you're also looking forward to reconnecting.

It's fantastic to hear about your productive week, especially your exploration of Napoleon Hill's "Think and Grow Rich." That book is a timeless classic, offering valuable insights on personal development and success. It's always enriching to delve into such literature that challenges and expands our thinking.
24/1/24, 5:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As for my week, while it was mostly focused on rest and recovery, I did manage to find some comfort in quieter activities, like reading and reflecting. It's always interesting how periods of rest can also be times of learning and personal growth in their own way.
24/1/24, 5:37 PM - +263 78 272 0741: That's true ma'am,times of rest can make you relive your life and relook the experiences and challenges you faced and overcame then the result of success after challenges.It makes us strong and realize that nomatter how bumpy the road gets there's always a soft tar for a soft ride.
24/1/24, 9:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263782720741 I completely agree with you. I would love to continue with our conversation however, given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
24/1/24, 10:42 PM - +263 78 272 0741: Goodnight
25/1/24, 7:21 AM - +263 78 272 0741: Good morning Ms Kirti
25/1/24, 12:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Nokutenda.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation yesterday since we were not able to move further with our discussion may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can continue with our discussion?
25/1/24, 12:05 PM - +263 78 272 0741: Yes we can connect ma'am l'm ready
25/1/24, 12:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing so may I know if you are clear so far?
25/1/24, 12:18 PM - +263 78 272 0741: Yes ma'am l'm clear so far
25/1/24, 12:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
25/1/24, 12:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $750, you'll need to make a payment of $375 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $375 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
25/1/24, 12:48 PM - +263 78 272 0741: Yes ma'am l want to ask if the registration fee is different from tuition fees and if the $750 instance is the annual fee I'll have to pay
25/1/24, 12:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand. This registration fee of $750 is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
25/1/24, 1:22 PM - +263 78 272 0741: I think l understand you're saying that the $750 will be part of my tuition fee but l'll have to pay half of it before the deadline so as to reserve my seat right??
25/1/24, 1:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263782720741 Yes please, this $750 you will have to pay when you receive your offer letter and you can pay this $750 in two installments and the remaining tuition fee after your arrival in India.
25/1/24, 1:27 PM - +263 78 272 0741: I understand now it's clear.
25/1/24, 1:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
25/1/24, 1:46 PM - +263 78 272 0741: No l don't have queries
25/1/24, 1:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process?
