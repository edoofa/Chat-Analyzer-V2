16/1/24, 9:52 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Proud Edoofians,

I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
16/1/24, 9:52 AM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
16/1/24, 9:52 AM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
16/1/24, 9:59 AM - +263 71 845 9184: Thank you ma'am.  Happy new year to you tooo.
16/1/24, 9:59 AM - +263 71 845 9184: As we family we are over the moon. Batsirai managed to pass his A levels with 13 points
16/1/24, 7:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, and thank you for your wishes. With great excitement and pride, I also want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
16/1/24, 7:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
16/1/24, 7:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
16/1/24, 7:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we discuss your admission journey further, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

10/2/24, 10:58 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings Batsirai, 

I trust this message finds you in good health. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admission officer at Edoofa.*  Today while I was organizing my day, I was going through our records, and I came across your scholarship application and noticed that you were one of the dedicated students who was so keen on pursuing your education abroad. However, because of some situations beyond your control, you were not able to turn your dream into a reality and since then we lost touch with each other.

Hence, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out personally and just check in with you and your family. How have you been doing? Were you able to start your higher education by now, or are you still exploring better opportunities?
10/2/24, 11:06 AM - +263 71 845 9184: Hello ma'am how are you doing?? I'm Batsirai's mum. We still stuck and don't know the way forward.  We were really hopeful that our son will be able to learn under the Edoofa scholarship.  We only got a scare when we saw the figures rising. The fee prices were okay with us and we hadn't factored in the Accommodation fees. We knew we would carter for the fee, travelling cost and visa cost. We are getting cold fit for we don't know if we will able to afford all of the costs. If we hard a rough estimation for how much it will cost us all in all to get our son enrolled  and learning in India  we can actually be able either to settle our fears or see wether we can really afford it all not. 
We are really scared of the cost for we don't know which other costs lay ahead.
10/2/24, 11:07 AM - +263 71 845 9184: If you cud help us with the estimate of the exact costs that we need. From the fees, accommodation costs, visas, travelling cost, every  cosy that we need to say right our son is set and ready to attend his University
10/2/24, 11:09 AM - +263 71 845 9184: I know this is too much to ask bt kindly help me because lm really confused and scared abt the costs
