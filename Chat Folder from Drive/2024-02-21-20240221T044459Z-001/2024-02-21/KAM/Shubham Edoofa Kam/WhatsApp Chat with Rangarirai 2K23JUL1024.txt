19/12/23, 9:00 AM - You joined using this group's invite link
16/1/24, 11:23 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Rangarirai,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 11:23 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 12:37 PM - +263 71 889 2415: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 4:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
16/1/24, 4:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly allow us time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, Mr. Shubham, the senior career counselor at Edoofa will connect with you to guide you on the next steps in your academic career.
16/1/24, 4:39 PM - +263 71 889 2415: Ok
24/1/24, 8:53 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good Day, Dear parent and Rangarirai
*I am Mr Shubham, Senior Acadmecian at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence I request you to come online at the earliest and notify me so that I can guide you ahead.
24/1/24, 8:53 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 8:54 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *Congratulations on your exemplary A-level results* At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.

May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
24/1/24, 1:32 PM - +263 71 889 2415: Hello Mr Shubham good afternoon. I am here now
24/1/24, 1:51 PM - +263 71 889 2415: We haven't found the money yet but by early March the requested amount will be on the table
24/1/24, 2:50 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I am doing great please
24/1/24, 2:50 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Can you elaborate please?

25/1/24, 8:25 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good Morning Everyone, 

*“If you think education is expensive, try ignorance.” --- Andy McIntyre*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
25/1/24, 8:50 AM - +263 71 889 2415: Good morning sir
25/1/24, 8:53 AM - +263 71 889 2415: We are facing a hard time with our network providers the internet speed is extremely slow. Hence that's why i showed up lately
25/1/24, 9:30 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I totally understand, please!
25/1/24, 9:31 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Please yesterday, I asked you a question, can you answer the same so that we can continue our session from where we left yesterday?
25/1/24, 9:33 AM - +263 71 889 2415: I was saying. We don't have the $750usd which was required by then for the university registration. Hence we planned to pay it in early March
25/1/24, 10:23 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: What if we are able to provide you with a flexible way to provide 3-part payments till March and then you can complete the formalities by a more convenient way and ensuring that Rangarirai's admissions process begins?
25/1/24, 10:29 AM - +263 71 889 2415: Ok so how is it going to be like
25/1/24, 10:30 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I will be assisting you with a flexible timeline, So that your family is able to afford all the formalities, Will that help you?
25/1/24, 10:31 AM - +263 71 889 2415: That will be good indeed <This message was edited>
25/1/24, 10:33 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So shall we begin with the session?
25/1/24, 10:40 AM - +263 71 889 2415: Yes please
25/1/24, 12:10 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: That is absolutely understandable and thank you for sharing. Being a senior academician and counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
25/1/24, 3:09 PM - +263 71 889 2415: Why sir?
25/1/24, 3:45 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>

*“Education is the key to unlocking the world. It is the passport to freedom.” ---- Oprah Winfrey*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
29/1/24, 4:29 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I was expecting your response, but I can see that you were not able to attend the session due to reasons unknown to us, Please understand that the only way that I and My team will be able to assist you is with your cooperation and participation in these sessions, taking out 20-30 minutes from your daily life can truly transform your child's life, *Hence I have scheduled your session for tomorrow at 09:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
30/1/24, 8:49 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good morning!  let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*"As the scriptures teach, knowledge is a steadfast companion. A person enlightened by wisdom is held in high regard across all realms. The brilliance of education surpasses the allure of beauty and the vigor of youth."*

May our journey of learning be guided by the profound teachings that echo through the ages. With positive energy, let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education.
30/1/24, 9:26 AM - +263 71 889 2415: Good morning sir
30/1/24, 9:29 AM - +263 77 312 4510: Morning sir, for sure it breaks life barriers.
30/1/24, 10:14 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I am doing great please
30/1/24, 10:14 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So before proceeding with the session, are there any questions you would like to ask?
30/1/24, 10:19 AM - +263 77 312 4510: I understand and appreciate that. Our biggest challenge for now is our choked final position. We have failed to meet given deadlines because of that issue. However our finances stabilize from early March. Another hindrance is poor network connection from service providers. Messages are taking long to deliver resultantly causing unnecessary inconveniences.
30/1/24, 10:23 AM - +263 77 312 4510: Is there another slot to fit in other the one we missed?
30/1/24, 11:07 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I totally understand the issue, and I can help you and Rangarirai, attain the education he deserved, So shall we continue ahead?
30/1/24, 11:51 AM - +263 77 312 4510: With much pleasure sir you may proceed
30/1/24, 12:43 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I see you are quite a visionary and we will work together to make the right decision for your career. It is important to know why the Edoofa guidance will be unique compared to the normal University approach.
30/1/24, 12:43 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *1. Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
30/1/24, 12:43 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 12:43 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *3. Financial Support and Planning:* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.
30/1/24, 12:43 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *4. Industrial Visits, Attachments and practical learning experiences:* With the recent example of SLICE-CON which stands for Symposium of Leaders, Innovators and Creators with Edoofa Conclave 24 where our Edoofians embarked on an enlightening industrial visit, immersing themselves in dynamic interactions with our esteemed Founder, CEOs of different Companies which are recognized worldwide, and visionary entrepreneurs from the industry. We are also visiting Zimbabwe in February to prepare our Edoofians for their journey and help them with the next level of career.

30/1/24, 12:43 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 12:44 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: These are just a few of the various benefits and keeping all this in mind, are you ready to step into your higher education through the Edoofa Program which is the most popular scholarship in Africa?
30/1/24, 1:01 PM - +263 77 312 4510: I think with a flexible payment  plan as indicated Edoofa scholarship program is the way to go!
30/1/24, 1:10 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Electrical Engineering) and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
30/1/24, 1:31 PM - +263 77 312 4510: Correct
30/1/24, 1:50 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*
30/1/24, 1:50 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
30/1/24, 2:08 PM - +263 77 312 4510: I remember  registration fees being able to be paid in flexible terms. Unfortunately I lost  some of the crucial information got in my stolen gadget. However you did sent me part of the information, I will thoroughly go through it over again. But if there's an important point that may need urgent clarity you may proceed furnishing me with such information
30/1/24, 2:36 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Duly noted please
30/1/24, 2:36 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
30/1/24, 2:37 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 
Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
30/1/24, 2:37 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee that you pay will be subtracted from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.

*Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
30/1/24, 3:17 PM - +263 77 312 4510: No not yet it's well said
30/1/24, 3:18 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
30/1/24, 3:38 PM - +263 77 312 4510: It's clear, when do universities normally require their fees?
30/1/24, 3:56 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: You will be update about the same shortly
30/1/24, 3:57 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I understand that you are interested in this golden opportunity to study in India under the given Scholarship. I do realize that your Family Members may have other concerns and this is the reason I have requested our Program Director Mr. Abhinav to spare some time to talk to you about this. I hope you recall that he was the one to Interview Rangarirai and had a Video Call with  Parents.
30/1/24, 3:57 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So are you available for the same right nw?
30/1/24, 4:11 PM - +263 77 312 4510: Ok noted
30/1/24, 4:15 PM - +263 77 312 4510: If they're other concerns I'll definitely raise alarm for your quick attention
30/1/24, 4:15 PM - +263 77 312 4510: So far so good
30/1/24, 4:19 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Duly noted please!
30/1/24, 4:26 PM - +263 71 889 2415: Yes thats correct
30/1/24, 4:27 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I understand that you are interested in this golden opportunity to study in India under the given Scholarship. I do realize that your Family Members may have other concerns and this is the reason I have requested our Program Director Mr. Abhinav to spare some time to talk to your Parents about this. I hope you recall that he was the one to Interview you and had a Video Call earlier.

*So I request the parents to be active for this interactive video call session with the Program Director* so that he can financially assist you and plan your child's higher education on Priority.

*Your video call session is scheduled for 09:15 AM CAT tomorrow*
31/1/24, 7:57 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good morning! Drawing inspiration from biblical wisdom: 

*"In the sacred texts, we find that knowledge is a faithful companion, elevating one to respect beyond borders. Education outshines both beauty and youth."*

31/1/24, 10:45 AM - +263 77 312 4510: No, I think it's ok. Only network connection from this end is a big menace!
31/1/24, 10:48 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Can  you elaborate?
31/1/24, 10:53 AM - +263 77 312 4510: Was answering your question. I'm only complaining about our communication with Mr Gupta being interrupted by poor network connection
31/1/24, 11:32 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Is the network issue now resolved?
31/1/24, 12:16 PM - +263 77 312 4510: It's fluctuating
31/1/24, 1:04 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So can you go to a place with a stable network?
31/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 77 312 4510: I have enquired the problem is power. No adequate electricity to power our system! The point I'm gets the better connection around here.
31/1/24, 2:24 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I understand so any updates about the same?
31/1/24, 2:50 PM - +263 77 312 4510: The problem still persists. Connection is intermittent. Needs patience!
31/1/24, 3:16 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Noted pelase
31/1/24, 6:35 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I will connect with you *tomorrow again at 09:00 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
1/2/24, 8:23 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good Morning Everyone,

1/2/24, 11:36 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So did you manage to connect with the Edoofa Program DIrector?
1/2/24, 2:45 PM - +263 77 312 4510: I did unfortunately network connection was poor. We could not talk via video call but voice notes maybe because of work load and probably impatient with our on/off network connection, the conversation wasn't that conclusive. Irregardless of that I picked crucial points from his side. He stressed the need to expedite the processes irregardless of impending financial constraints. He was much concerned about beating time frames keeping in mind that the available time may seem more but due processes may consume much of it.

 No question yet sir
5/2/24, 9:11 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Hello @263773124510 
During your session with the Program Director a few days back, He mentioned that he had made a special exemption for your child and that he would be personally looking over your child's application. *Since then he has personally forwarded your child's application to various universities here In India for a higher quantum of scholarship.*

*But I believe he also asked you to complete the initial registration formalities on priority as he would be visiting Zimbabwe in the third week of February*, So May I know about the updates regarding the same and when are you planning to complete the formalities towards the semester fees?
5/2/24, 9:30 AM - +263 77 312 4510: You're quite right, because of our inhibitive current financial status he edged me to raise $300 this first week of February to get the registration process to take off. I hope before this  weekend I would have got part of the fee.
5/2/24, 10:03 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Duly noted please, So are you aware of the transaction methods as well?
5/2/24, 10:09 AM - +263 77 312 4510: I have since lost that information I used to have it
5/2/24, 10:13 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me assist you with the same
5/2/24, 10:13 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: If you can make the payment from Harare, that case the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
5/2/24, 10:13 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
5/2/24, 10:13 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
5/2/24, 10:13 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send.

9/2/24, 5:05 PM - +263 71 889 2415: Here is the thing sir. I am born in a family of six, as i highlighted before, and i am a second born in that family. This means that we have got four more kids who are still doing there ordinary and primary education respectively. There this means that a lot of money is required to fund those kids and i myself lately for i am about to pursue my higher education. For this reason i opted for an Edoofa scholarship so it could help me in relieving this kind of pressure on our family as we are ordinary famers growing tobacco and maize. Hence, releasing such kind of money like $2800 you always mention, that is per year if am not mistaken, it takes a while to digest and to give it a go. Nevertheless that registration fee you requested, we will be working tirelessly to make it available as soon as possible.

 Thank you
