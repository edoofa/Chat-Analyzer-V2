This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.

Edoofa Admission Team.
7/1/24, 8:33 AM - +263 71 852 8592: Thank you so much Sir have good time
8/1/24, 2:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tatenda,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honoured to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
8/1/24, 2:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
8/1/24, 2:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 2:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
8/1/24, 3:42 PM - +263 71 852 8592: Thank you very much and same to you may God do great wonders to us this year
8/1/24, 4:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your kind wishes, dear. I hope that God grants us the strength to achieve great wonders this year.

A new year brings forth a multitude of possibilities and fresh opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practice more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?
9/1/24, 9:39 AM - +263 71 852 8592: To finishy admission process as soon as possible and join other in August to lndia for my tertiary

9/1/24, 10:00 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Surely, dear.
9/1/24, 10:01 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
9/1/24, 10:01 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, I would encourage you to go through the above image representing your university admission process and once you are done, let me know so that I can explain the same to you.

9/1/24, 10:25 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
9/1/24, 10:25 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school. <This message was edited>

However, in recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 7:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 8:40 PM - +263 71 852 8592: Ok Ma'am

14/2/24, 8:05 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good Morning Dear, 
Hope you are doing well
I have been trying to connect with you to understand if you are facing any challenges in registering yourself for the event?
14/2/24, 9:28 AM - +263 71 277 9226: Good morning. Is it still necessary to register when Tatenda is now training as a Registered General Nurse locally. Where he is there is poor network and they are not allowed to have phones in class. Can I feel the form so that I can go and discuss on possible refund of the initial payment.
14/2/24, 2:11 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Duly noted please
20/2/24, 7:40 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good Morning Everyone,
