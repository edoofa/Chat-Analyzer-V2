I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
12/1/24, 5:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
12/1/24, 5:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
16/1/24, 12:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Proud Edoofians,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

31/1/24, 9:48 AM - +263 77 857 6268: Greetings sir ,sorry l can not proceed with undergraduate degree in India due to financial reasons and l have been enrolled  at a cheap University in Zimbabwe due to financial crisis we are facing ,so l was wondering if it's possible to keep the scholarship pending maybe l might get a chance to persue my masters there
31/1/24, 10:27 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I understand Talent, So in which university have you applied to?
31/1/24, 10:28 AM - +263 77 857 6268: I have applied at Midlands State University
31/1/24, 11:18 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Having Conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.
31/1/24, 11:19 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I am shocked to compile these data for Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities of Zimbabwe.

*Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE)* -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - *($680 per term)*

*Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT)* https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - *($535 per term)*

*University of Zimbabwe (UZ)* -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm *($523 per term)*

NUST -*($870 per term)*
31/1/24, 11:19 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: While the cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, the cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal which is Sadza and curry costs a student $1 one time and you are aware of this better. The cost of *Accommodation, Food, Wifi, stationery, gadgets, transport* etc is an additional expense for a student. The initial registration fee for the Zimbabwean Universities ranges from *$20-$75 without the guarantee of being eligible or not.* The *attachment fee before graduation ranges from $200 or more.*
31/1/24, 11:19 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me tell you, I was caught in surprise when I compared it with the Edoofa Scholarship Program, not because of affordability but the opportunity to acquire skills, and knowledge and be employable. Speaking about Employability, do you feel Zimbabwe is ready to equip the graduates with job opportunities in their aspired fields?
31/1/24, 11:25 AM - +263 77 857 6268: Well the fees are correct but most of these universities are paying using the zimbabwean currency which is ZWL of wc if you convert it correctly also using the black market rate let me use MSU as an example the fees is 618USD but if you convert it using the current bank rate and black market rate it mounts to 407USD per Semester whereas the Accomodation fee at rez is $140USD and when you convert it again it's something like  $92USD where there is WiFi and also buses which ferry students to and from their prospective campuses
31/1/24, 11:31 AM - +263 77 857 6268: Well the opportunities are there as compared to those in Zimbabwe, and being able to acquire a job might be difficult but we have no other options because the calculations we did helped us to make a decision of which considering our current financial instability  ,we also considered other factors like what if we fail to pay up the money which will be needed whilst studying in India on yearly basis ,that would be a problem sir
31/1/24, 12:30 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Please you are incorrect the above stated fees is after the Conversion Talent
31/1/24, 1:12 PM - +263 77 857 6268: No sir  let me share a screenshot of the fees structure and the options of payment
31/1/24, 1:12 PM - +263 77 857 6268: <Media omitted>
