2/2/24, 11:03 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: If you can make the payment from Harare, that case the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
2/2/24, 11:03 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
2/2/24, 11:03 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
2/2/24, 11:03 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send.
