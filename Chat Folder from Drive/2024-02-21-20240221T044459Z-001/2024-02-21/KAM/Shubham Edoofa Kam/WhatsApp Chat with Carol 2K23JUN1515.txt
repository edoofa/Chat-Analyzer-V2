I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 11:17 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education.

*Since you have not been attending your sessions regularly, I wanted to check if everything is okay or what issues are you facing?*
7/2/24, 10:21 AM - +263 77 341 4460: Good morning we are all fine

Industrial Visits, Attachments and practical learning experiences:* With the recent example of SLICE-CON which stands for Symposium of Leaders, Innovators and Creators with Edoofa Conclave 24 where our Edoofians embarked on an enlightening industrial visit, immersing themselves in dynamic interactions with our esteemed Founder, CEOs of different Companies which are recognized worldwide, and visionary entrepreneurs from the industry. We are also visiting Zimbabwe in February to prepare our Edoofians for their journey and help them with the next level of career.

7/2/24, 4:46 PM - +263 77 341 4460: I understand all your explanation sir but looking our  family background we see it's better to  quit the scholarship she can study local here in Zim or she will apply for for funded scholarship
