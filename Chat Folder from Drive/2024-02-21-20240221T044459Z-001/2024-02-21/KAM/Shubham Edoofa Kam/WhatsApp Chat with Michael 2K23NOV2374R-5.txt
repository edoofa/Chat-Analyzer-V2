This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
19/12/23, 12:28 PM - +263 71 355 8896: Yes it is and I appreciate
19/12/23, 12:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that @263713558896. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575

5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1600  (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1850.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1600. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?

It will cost the students a monthly expense of $40 to $50 to gather groceries or even sometimes order food from outside the university, giving you affordability and convenience too. I hope I am clear on this?

20/12/23, 6:59 AM - +263 71 355 8896: 3 pm sounds fine to me.
20/12/23, 1:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you @263713558896, Let's connect at 3:00 pm
20/12/23, 2:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Michael, Wishing you all a good day!
20/12/23, 2:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With respect to our discussion, I would like to know if you are ready for today's discussion about your offer letter, Could you please share your response?
20/12/23, 3:02 PM - +263 71 355 8896: Yes I am ready now
20/12/23, 3:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation @263713558896, As we have established your total annual education cost as $1600, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
20/12/23, 3:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
20/12/23, 3:06 PM - +263 71 355 8896: Clearly understood
20/12/23, 3:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a student. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $1600. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1600 - $1000 = $600, which will need to be paid by your parents/guardians.

This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
20/12/23, 3:11 PM - +263 71 355 8896: Noted. Well clarified
20/12/23, 3:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
20/12/23, 3:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1850 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $850 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
20/12/23, 3:16 PM - +263 71 355 8896: Yes this I have understood as well
20/12/23, 3:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Glad to see we share the same perspective. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1850. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you  arrive in India will be $1,500 - $1850 = $850 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
20/12/23, 3:22 PM - +263 71 355 8896: Yes it's clear too ma'am
20/12/23, 3:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as January 1st, 2024*. <This message was edited>
20/12/23, 3:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
20/12/23, 3:25 PM - +263 71 355 8896: But is There an a payment plan??
20/12/23, 3:26 PM - +263 71 355 8896: Yes please do so
20/12/23, 3:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $900 of the registration fee. This $900 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $450 before the first deadline date of *January 1st, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $450 before the second deadline date of *February 1st 2024, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
20/12/23, 3:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Name's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $900 within 15 working days, before January 1st, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
20/12/23, 3:32 PM - +263 71 355 8896: Understood
20/12/23, 3:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
20/12/23, 3:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
20/12/23, 3:34 PM - +263 71 355 8896: Yes. I have understood ma'am
20/12/23, 3:35 PM - +263 71 355 8896: No I'm in Kadoma
20/12/23, 3:36 PM - +263 71 355 8896: So when paying the registration fee,, does it also include the 12.5 % bank charges?
20/12/23, 3:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263713558896
20/12/23, 3:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
20/12/23, 3:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
20/12/23, 3:40 PM - +263 71 355 8896: This means on top of the 450 I have to add 7% of that?
20/12/23, 3:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
20/12/23, 3:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263713558896,
20/12/23, 3:43 PM - +263 71 355 8896: Okay. Understood
20/12/23, 3:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.
20/12/23, 3:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
20/12/23, 3:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
20/12/23, 3:45 PM - +27 63 101 5527: Is the registration payable 3days after arrival in India or before
20/12/23, 3:48 PM - +263 71 355 8896: No thank you. I still have the details
20/12/23, 3:48 PM - +27 63 101 5527: And the offer letter says ...subject to eligibility to program based on Alevel results ...what happens if the registration is paid and when Alevel results are out MVN decides he is not eligible
20/12/23, 3:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @27631015527 The registration fees needs to be clear within the deadlines shared by the university.
20/12/23, 4:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me assist you here please, As you are concern for the eligibility criteria, I would like to share that the eligibility is based on the subject combination in Michael's A level and based on the documents we have submitted he is already found eligible for the admission in MVN University. I hope you understand?
20/12/23, 4:04 PM - +263 71 355 8896: So ma'am is there hope that another university might accept which is quite cheaper than MVN University?
20/12/23, 4:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263713558896 May I know if there is any challenge?
20/12/23, 4:05 PM - +263 71 355 8896: Well the fees and deadlines might be quite a challenge for us
20/12/23, 4:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, Could you please share what is the challenge there dear?
20/12/23, 4:06 PM - +263 71 355 8896: The deadline of 1st of January, we will just be coming out of the festive season so I'm sure you can understand
20/12/23, 4:07 PM - +263 71 355 8896: The 450 that needs to be paid on or before the 1st of January
20/12/23, 4:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I truly understand your challenges, and appreciate your efforts in sharing them with us. Being your admission officer, I would love to help you here, for the same it's important for me to have a better understanding of the current situation. Hence, May I kindly know how much you will be able to pay by the deadline?
20/12/23, 4:46 PM - +263 71 355 8896: Let me discuss it first with my parents and get back to you
20/12/23, 4:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Please discuss about this with your parents and I would be here waiting for your response.
20/12/23, 4:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, in the meantime I would love to assist you with this query. Shall we proceed?
20/12/23, 4:50 PM - +263 71 355 8896: Thank you
20/12/23, 4:50 PM - +263 71 355 8896: Yes let's proceed
20/12/23, 4:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Most Welcome @263713558896
20/12/23, 4:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
20/12/23, 4:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
20/12/23, 4:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the MVN University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
20/12/23, 4:54 PM - +263 71 355 8896: Okay I understand now. Thank you so much for the assistance
20/12/23, 4:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome dear, As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by MVN, you would lose out on the scholarship from MVN and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
20/12/23, 4:57 PM - +263 71 355 8896: Transfer?
20/12/23, 4:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with MVN by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Gulzar without risking losing out on the scholarship.
20/12/23, 4:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $1000 to MVN University to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $1000.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $1000, but because you would have already paid $1000 for MVN, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $1000 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
20/12/23, 4:59 PM - +263 71 355 8896: Yes now I have clearly understood. Thank you
20/12/23, 5:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @263713558896 Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?

28/12/23, 6:55 PM - +27 63 101 5527: Sorry am battle with connection
28/12/23, 7:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries dear, May I know if we can continue now?

28/12/23, 7:14 PM - +263 71 355 8896: I'm speaking in accordance to this payment plan, but only for January and February month ends
28/12/23, 7:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Well Understood @263713558896, If you don't mind, May I ask what are your plans to raise the registration amount?
28/12/23, 7:19 PM - +263 71 355 8896: We can afford to raise the money at month ends only
28/12/23, 7:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, I understand that you have challenges at the moment, I would do my best to assist you here with the effective financial plans. As you said that you want to pay the $170 now for your enrollment fees and you will pay the registration fees at the end of January. <This message was edited>
28/12/23, 7:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, on that note, please write a mail to "academicboard@edoofa.com" stating that you had a discussion with your admission officer Ms. Ashi about the cause of the delay in your registration fee and state the reason why and even mention the date and amount that you will be able to pay $170 for your remaining enrollment fees before 30th December 2023. For the registration fees, you will pay $450 by 30th January, 2024 and $450 by 29th February.

Please also mention your admission group name in the mail, once done share the screenshot with me.
28/12/23, 7:27 PM - +263 71 355 8896: No this one I'm paying on Saturday the 30th of this month
28/12/23, 7:29 PM - +263 71 355 8896: Okay so does this mean I'll still be making the payment to MVN University
28/12/23, 7:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263713558896 We will request the university to allow you extension considering that you have genuine concern.
28/12/23, 7:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes dear, this is what I have mentioned in the message
28/12/23, 7:33 PM - +263 71 355 8896: Okay fine. So no other University other than MVN has offer me a place??
28/12/23, 7:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263713558896 I understand that you are looking forward to other university, although let me share that at the moment we have only received the offer letter from MVN University. I remember earlier that you were asking about Lovely Professional University and Galgotias University, I want to share that these are one of the best private universities in India that focuses more on branding and that is the reason they have good exposure for the students, however, it's a bit challenging for the parents to afford Higher Education at these university as the fees structure at these university will be a bit expensive.
28/12/23, 7:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: When you enrolled in the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I had a conversation with your counselor and he suggested us to apply your application for higher quantum of scholarship which is why we have applied your application at one of the best university which not only offer the quality of education but also have the cost of education which is affordable by parent.
28/12/23, 7:43 PM - +263 71 355 8896: Oooh now I understand,,, thank you so much and we appreciate your concern.
28/12/23, 7:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome dear. May I know by when you will be able to mail the academic board?
28/12/23, 7:47 PM - +263 71 355 8896: Tomorrow evening when I have good Wifi connection
28/12/23, 7:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Once you share the mail please make sure to share the screenshot with us, so that I can move ahead and request the academic board for the extension
28/12/23, 7:49 PM - +263 71 355 8896: Okay okay thank you
28/12/23, 7:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263713558896, Have a good night!
28/12/23, 7:50 PM - +263 71 355 8896: Have a good night
30/12/23, 10:58 AM - +263 71 355 8896: Good morning @919650537098 I hope I find you well. May I please discuss something of paramount importance with you.
30/12/23, 12:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning @263713558896, I hope you are doing well. 

Sure, dear. I would love to have a discussion with you dear.
30/12/23, 12:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As I am waiting for your response. In the meantime, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of the remaining part of $150 for your Edoofa Enrollment fee by today- 30th December 2023. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far. Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
30/12/23, 1:04 PM - +263 71 355 8896: Yes about that ma'am,, after a very close analysis we have seen that we will not be able to afford fees for me to study abroad
30/12/23, 1:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263713558896, May I know what is the concern dear?
30/12/23, 1:15 PM - +263 71 355 8896: Okay so the main concern is being able to raise 900 by February month end, and then another 850 by August..
30/12/23, 1:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I  understand your concern, although I am sure that the cost of education was shared with you earlier, right?
30/12/23, 1:18 PM - +263 71 355 8896: Yes it was and we thought it was affordable but from the look of things, and being honest for us, it just isn't.
30/12/23, 1:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I appreciate your honesty in sharing your concern with us. As you shared that you have challenge in paying the registration fees, we already helped you by giving you the flexible payment plan. For the tuition fees, There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
30/12/23, 1:27 PM - +263 71 355 8896: Yes true but my parents are struggling to put the whole amount together
30/12/23, 1:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, I understand that you are having financial challenge, and that's why I am here to help you. We have shared the payment plan with you so that you can complete the procedure without having any challenge, hence I am not understanding which amount you are referring here. Could you please let me know?
30/12/23, 1:39 PM - +263 71 355 8896: Ma'am,,, paying 1600 a year is almost the same as studying here in Zimbabwe, so it's rather wise if the amounts are almost the same, why not just stay and study here and we might be thinking of taking a gap year to balance off things and be financially prepared for my tertiary education
30/12/23, 1:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me dear, As you have shared that the cost of education in Zimbabwe is same as here in India. May I know if you have searched well dear?
30/12/23, 1:53 PM - +27 63 101 5527: Can we just apply our minds on this matter a little bit more and arrive at a desicion
30/12/23, 1:53 PM - +27 63 101 5527: Issue isnt so much the amounts but the deadlines are tight and unmanageable
30/12/23, 1:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am here to help you regarding your concern @27631015527, but it is only possible when you will keep the transparency in sharing your actual concern with us. For the clear understanding, Please let me know what is the challenge?
30/12/23, 1:58 PM - +27 63 101 5527: The challenge isnt the quantum of the fees but more to do with deadlines ...it's hard to come up with those amounts at such short notice in this part of the world
30/12/23, 1:58 PM - +27 63 101 5527: We can eventually put it together but not inside 2 weeks
30/12/23, 1:59 PM - +27 63 101 5527: Re;registration balances
30/12/23, 1:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand so the challenge is with the deadline right?
30/12/23, 2:00 PM - +27 63 101 5527: Correct
30/12/23, 2:03 PM - +27 63 101 5527: With the actual tuition fees portion we have I think up to July 2024 to make necessary adjustments, savings to meet our end of the obligation...but with registration fee...the timeline is tight
30/12/23, 2:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Well Understood @27631015527, To assist you here, Could you let me know by when you think you will be able to complete the registration process?
30/12/23, 2:07 PM - +27 63 101 5527: Ok it's my humble request you treat the first payment as a commitment to the program and give me a day to table a proper financial arrangement that we can execute
30/12/23, 2:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure please, Take you time and have a discussion as a family.

3/1/24, 6:33 PM - +27 63 101 5527: March 2024
3/1/24, 6:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, I understand that you are going through a difficult situation, however, since you are aware that the universities have already issued the deadlines for you, and as you are aware that there are only limited rounds of applications that are opened by the universities, therefore we can only request them for an extension of some days. 

But here you are asking for an extension of 2 months, that is practically impossible since by that time the universities might not allow you the endowment benefits. Now, in this situation, I was planning to help you in a better way so that you may not lose on the opportunity that you have here. So, shall we discuss that now?
3/1/24, 6:38 PM - +27 63 101 5527: Yes
3/1/24, 6:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, @27631015527. since you have mentioned that you have financial difficulty at present, and due to that, you are finding it challenging to complete the admission process. Now, being your admission officer, I personally do not want you to lose on this opportunity that you have now since it will affect Michael's career and future. 

So, on a personal front, I can help you in dealing with the admission process in a better way if you can help me understand about your financial preparations as of this month, how much amount is it that you can find it possible to raise for your admission fee in this month?
3/1/24, 6:42 PM - +27 63 101 5527: $200usd
3/1/24, 6:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For the clear understanding this $200 is for university registration right?
3/1/24, 6:43 PM - +27 63 101 5527: Yes
3/1/24, 6:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation @27631015527, May I know by when you think you can pay this amount  ?

3/1/24, 6:57 PM - +27 63 101 5527: Yes
3/1/24, 6:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, I will have conversation with the university officials to tackle the financial challenges you're facing concerning the upcoming registration fee. However, I want to know if you can make the initial payment of $100 by this week as this will give us the strong base to present your case and approve the above payment plan. May I know if that's possible ?
3/1/24, 7:02 PM - +27 63 101 5527: No it's not possible I am not expecting any funds till monthend ...and the little that's there his sister has to return to school next week ..that arrangement will not unfortunately work...I am trying to as honest and practical with this situation as possible

4/1/24, 3:18 PM - +263 71 355 8896: Yes I am

4/1/24, 6:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings @27631015527, May I kindly know if you are available for the discussion please ?
4/1/24, 6:21 PM - +27 63 101 5527: I m available now
4/1/24, 6:21 PM - +27 63 101 5527: Battled with connection
4/1/24, 6:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand please, I would like to mention that with regards to our last conversation, I have taken proactive steps to address your concerns with the team. While we understand that you are having financial concerns at the moment, and we are trying our best to help you out so that Michael can pursue his Higher Education. However, we are concerned that the enrollment fees have not been completed by the due date, which makes it difficult for me to approve the payment plan we discussed.

As you know that the deadline to complete the remaining enrollment fees was the 30th of December, and it is essential to fulfill this remaining fees to strengthen your case for the payment plan approval. It would not be possible for me to approve the payment plan as you have not paid this amount which makes your case weak and I will not be able to put your case forward.
