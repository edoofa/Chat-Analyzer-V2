I am *Mr. Shivjeet, and I serve as the Admission Officer at Edoofa.* I wanted to extend my heartfelt wishes to you and your family for a prosperous and fulfilling 2024. 

I firmly believe that with the commencement of this new year, comes the promise of fresh beginnings, guiding the way for the actualization of one's deepest dreams and aspirations. As we stand on the threshold of this promising year, I am filled with excitement for the adventures it holds.
6/1/24, 1:28 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the same spirit, I would like to share that I am embarking on a journey as I prepare myself to pursue my doctorate and take a step forward in my academic pursuits. This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.
6/1/24, 1:28 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The decision to transition to a new phase in my life presents an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of students, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience remain enriched and fulfilling.

As I embark on this new journey, I want to assure you that I have entrusted your application file to capable hands. From this point forward, your admission journey will be seamlessly guided by one of our accomplished admission officers, *Ms. Siddhi,* who will connect with you on Tuesday.  I hope you will make yourself available for further procedures and will give your best to your career.
6/1/24, 1:28 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments. Wish you all the best, and God Bless.

8/1/24, 2:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Simba,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honoured to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
8/1/24, 2:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
8/1/24, 2:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 2:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
16/1/24, 7:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Simba,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. I was hoping to get a response from your end following my previous messages. However, in recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 7:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 9:55 PM - +263 77 339 6006: Good evening. Thank you for everything. Simba got his results and he did well, he has 3 A Level passes. Unfortunately due to circumstances beyond my control, he is not able to proceed with the Edoofa program. Things are very tight in Zimbabwe at the moment and with only one source of income which is reducing by the day, I can't afford for him to be in India. Thank you very much for everything.
22/1/24, 9:52 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good Day, Simba
*I am Mr Shubham, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*

Recalling our interaction after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today.
22/1/24, 9:56 AM - +263 77 339 6006: Good day. I will ask Simba to share his results. But nevertheless he is not able to proceed, I can't afford the costs for him to travel

25/1/24, 12:10 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: That is absolutely understandable and thank you for sharing. Being a senior academician and counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?

30/1/24, 11:15 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Surely please
30/1/24, 11:16 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA (Geography) and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
30/1/24, 11:17 AM - +263 77 339 6006: Yes
30/1/24, 11:53 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*
30/1/24, 11:53 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
30/1/24, 6:14 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 6:46 PM - +263 77 339 6006: I asked for estimate figures for fees, visa and flights please. I need to make a decision as soon as possible
30/1/24, 6:47 PM - +263 77 339 6006: Before you proceed with the enrollment process please share the requested figures

God Bless You!
1/2/24, 9:07 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good morning!
I trust you are doing well. 
*I've observed that my messages have been read but not responded to. In moments of silence, I'm reminded of Psalm 37:7 (NIV): "Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him."*
 Is everything alright?
1/2/24, 9:11 AM - +263 77 339 6006: Good morning. I have also noted that you have been avoiding my questions about the costs which I need to plan for. What is the reason for this?
1/2/24, 9:57 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Please I have not been avoiding the same, these sessions follow a particular chronology that we have to look into and I will be sharing all the details with you in our session today, So shall we proceeded ahead?
1/2/24, 9:57 AM - +263 77 339 6006: I am listening Sir
1/2/24, 10:22 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So shall we continue with our session of the day?
1/2/24, 10:58 AM - +263 77 339 6006: Yes
1/2/24, 12:12 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
1/2/24, 12:12 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 
Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
1/2/24, 12:12 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee that you pay will be subtracted from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.

*Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
1/2/24, 12:16 PM - +263 77 339 6006: Noted. So lets just say Simba needs to take the $900 with him when he travels right? What is the cost of the ticket to India and the visa?
1/2/24, 12:57 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Please that will be around $450
1/2/24, 5:10 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
2/2/24, 9:27 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good morning! let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*Proverbs 9:9 (NIV):*
*"Instruct the wise and they will be wiser still; teach the righteous and they will add to their learning."*

Let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education.
2/2/24, 4:33 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I was expecting your response, but I can see that you were not able to attend the session due to reasons unknown to us, Please understand that the only way that I and My team will be able to assist you is with your cooperation and participation in these sessions, taking out 20-30 minutes from your daily life can truly transform your child's life, *Hence I have scheduled your session for tomorrow at 09:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
3/2/24, 8:18 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good morning! let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*Proverbs 3:13-18 (NIV):*

*"Blessed are those who find wisdom, those who gain understanding, for she is more profitable than silver and yields better returns than gold. She is more precious than rubies; nothing you desire can compare with her."*

Let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education.
3/2/24, 1:45 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As it's the weekend, *Now we will connect for our session on Monday at 09:00 AM. Please be online during your session.*

Let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education.
5/2/24, 3:54 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *Embrace education as the key to a brighter future. Proverbs 4:7 (NIV) wisely states, "The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom." Seize the opportunity to break free from limitations. Keep in mind Philippians 4:13 (NIV), "I can do all this through him who gives me strength." Let education empower your child!*

Over the past few days, we've been trying to connect with you to discuss your child's academic journey. We understand the financial commitments involved in providing quality education for your child. The challenges in Africa, particularly the uncertainty of employment after completing a bachelor's degree, are evident.

Considering the urgency of your child's education, I've scheduled a session for *tomorrow at 09:30 AM CAT* .Looking forward to connecting with you tomorrow.
6/2/24, 8:49 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good morning! let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*Proverbs 1:5:*

*"Let the wise listen and add to their learning.' In the tapestry of progress, education is the thread that weaves nations together. As India seeks wisdom, let us prioritize education, creating a future where knowledge transcends boundaries and resonates more profoundly than ever. A commitment to learning is a commitment to a thriving, united nation."*

Let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education.
6/2/24, 8:52 AM - +263 77 339 6006: Goo morning. I understand I will be looking at raising $1400 for Simba to travel for his studies. I am afraid I will not be able to afford that amount
6/2/24, 9:17 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I understand so what would be your plans ahead?
6/2/24, 9:18 AM - +263 77 339 6006: I am struggling to make ends meet right now. So I will send Simba to a local university where I can ask for payment terms.
6/2/24, 9:34 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So before proceeding with the session, are there any questions you would like to ask?
6/2/24, 9:48 AM - +263 77 339 6006: I have no further questions.
6/2/24, 10:40 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So is the reason you were not particip[rating for the sessions earlier?
6/2/24, 10:42 AM - +263 77 339 6006: Sir I am sure I spoke about this right at the beginning when you asked about Simba's results. That is when I asked you for an estimate of amounts expected and it took you a while before sending. I also explained that I work from 0800hrs to 1630hrs, and so the time you engage for sessions I will be at work, so I can't give you 100% attention
6/2/24, 11:41 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I totally understand please
6/2/24, 11:42 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Since you will not be able to raise the $1400, So what are your plans for Simba then?
6/2/24, 11:44 AM - +263 77 339 6006: So I will send Simba to a local university where I can ask for payment terms.
6/2/24, 12:16 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me help you understand the Situation in Zimbabwe in much more detail

While the cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, the cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal which is Sadza and curry costs a student $1 one time and you are aware of this better. The cost of *Accommodation, Food, Wifi, stationery, gadgets, transport* etc is an additional expense for a student. The initial registration fee for the Zimbabwean Universities ranges from *$20-$75 without the guarantee of being eligible or not.* The *attachment fee before graduation ranges from $200 or more.*
6/2/24, 12:17 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me tell you, I was caught in surprise when I compared it with the Edoofa Scholarship Program, not because of affordability but the opportunity to acquire skills, knowledge and be employable. Speaking about Employability, do you feel Zimbabwe is ready to equip the graduates with job opportunities in their aspired fields?
6/2/24, 12:30 PM - +263 77 339 6006: I hear you and I agree with you. If I had a way of raising the amount at once I would.
6/2/24, 12:40 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Can you elaborate?
6/2/24, 1:08 PM - +263 77 339 6006: I think I have tried to be as clear as possible Sir. I can't afford for Simba to travel abroad to study. When finances permit later in life I will send him outside Zimbabwe, but for now he will do his studies in Zimbabwe.
6/2/24, 1:23 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I totally understand the situation you are facing, Knowing the same the Program Director wishes to connect with you over a video call session tomorrow, May I know by when will you be available for the same?
