16/1/24, 12:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Natasha,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 3:58 PM - +263 78 724 8051: Greetings, l will send   after collecting them from school.l failed to open the portal because of poor network l have been facing

20/1/24, 8:39 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
20/1/24, 8:39 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly allow us time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, Mr. Austin, the senior career counselor at Edoofa will connect with you to guide you on the next steps in your academic career.

*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, we had hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence I request you to come online at the earliest and notify me so that I can guide you ahead.

22/1/24, 4:10 PM - +263 71 994 1766: Let us wait for Natasha to be online

We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

As scheduled yesterday, I a here for the session. Are you ready?

1/2/24, 9:50 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I can understand!
1/2/24, 9:50 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: It is important to know the facts of Edoofa's guidance and uniqueness compared to the normal University approach.

1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.

1/2/24, 9:51 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

1/2/24, 11:26 AM - +267 78 427 538: We are but still facing problem here financially
1/2/24, 11:41 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I understand and I am here with a solution for the same where I will be recommending Natasha's application for up to a 100% scholarship on tuition and even Accommodation thereby reducing the costs lesser than that of Zimbabwe. The costs can be further reduced through the Earn WHile You Learn Program thereby students can even self finance their education
1/2/24, 11:56 AM - +267 78 427 538: So what's next now
1/2/24, 12:17 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Let me guide you forward, To confirm our records: the course Natasha selected for her higher education is Bachelor of Business Administration and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
1/2/24, 12:17 PM - +267 78 427 538: OK we are looking forward for your assistance Mr Austin
1/2/24, 12:18 PM - +267 78 427 538: Yes it is sir
1/2/24, 12:29 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
1/2/24, 1:16 PM - +263 78 724 8051: Greetings,you said the university will ask which amount to be paid for the given time
1/2/24, 1:21 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with the same
1/2/24, 1:22 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
1/2/24, 1:22 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counseling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program *as I will be recommending your application for a higher quantum of scholarship.* Congratulations on the same. Now, let us assume,
1/2/24, 1:22 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*

4. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
1/2/24, 1:22 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education ($1650-$1000= $650) and this remaining fee of $650 is supposed to be paid within 3 days of arrival.
1/2/24, 1:22 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
1/2/24, 1:25 PM - +263 78 724 8051: Ok sir
1/2/24, 1:31 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Do you have any questions for me as of now?
1/2/24, 2:10 PM - +263 78 724 8051: No sir,l will let you know
