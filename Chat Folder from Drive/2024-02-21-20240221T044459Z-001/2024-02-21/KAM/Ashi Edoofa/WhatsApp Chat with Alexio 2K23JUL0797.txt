16/1/24, 1:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Alexio,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 1:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 78 186 1128: Good afternoon Mr Milan, I have already shared my A level results with you
16/1/24, 1:55 PM - +263 78 186 1128: Do you want me to share them again?
22/1/24, 6:15 AM - +263 78 186 1128: Greetings Mr Milan, how are you?
