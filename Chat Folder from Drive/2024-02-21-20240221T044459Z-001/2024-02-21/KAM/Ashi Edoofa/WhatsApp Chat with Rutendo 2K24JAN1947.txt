7/2/24, 12:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

7/2/24, 12:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
7/2/24, 12:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
7/2/24, 12:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
7/2/24, 12:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear.
7/2/24, 12:53 PM - +263 78 759 9952: Yes they are clear
7/2/24, 12:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
7/2/24, 12:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
7/2/24, 12:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
7/2/24, 12:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
7/2/24, 1:04 PM - +263 77 264 6599: Yes ,me too am following
7/2/24, 1:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
7/2/24, 1:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
7/2/24, 1:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
7/2/24, 1:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
7/2/24, 1:06 PM - +263 77 264 6599: Very clear and understandable
7/2/24, 1:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
7/2/24, 1:11 PM - +263 78 759 9952: Yes we can begin
7/2/24, 1:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life.

7/2/24, 5:54 PM - +263 78 759 9952: So the first video i had a clear picture on the proud edoofian there india and how the Earn While You Learn Program has given them a feeling a independence.  The founders of Edoofa also highlighted on the fact they interacted with people  with high potential as well as success and the ones who failed the succeed  sue to circumstances. They mainly highlighted on candidates like me to follow instructions as well as be open minded and creative in order to enjoy the whole process
7/2/24, 6:11 PM - +263 78 759 9952: The second video  highlightes on the goal or aims of the Edoofa scholarship which is to make students employed even with the changing demands . Their goal is to make education affordable  as they have relationships with universities . Lastly they guide , mentor and show the path of success to students  financially challenged  as well .

7/2/24, 6:41 PM - +263 78 759 9952: The third video exposes on how edoofa has worked hard to provide a system ,platform,  network  as well as resources for students to pass .It also highlightes that it observes the universities or colleges  on how the quality of ts education ,quality of the teaching stuff,  universities that make students employable after graduating as well as accommodation for the international students .These universities support the EWYL program for more scholarships credits for the students  .The edoofa team view themselves as parents who also sending their children to those universities which is very considering
7/2/24, 6:55 PM - +263 78 759 9952: The last video  explains about the SOP which convinces the university on why i want to study there . It also contains my abilities, strengths, skills as well as visions. It also indicates the Edoofa's  recommendation plays a huge part in securing a place in the university.
7/2/24, 7:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
7/2/24, 7:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
7/2/24, 7:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
7/2/24, 7:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
7/2/24, 7:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
7/2/24, 7:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
7/2/24, 7:27 PM - +263 78 759 9952: Yes i agree
7/2/24, 7:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
7/2/24, 7:34 PM - +263 78 759 9952: Yes
7/2/24, 7:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
7/2/24, 7:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

I hope by then you will be able to fill out all the forms. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed night and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
8/2/24, 9:30 AM - +263 78 759 9952: <Media omitted>
8/2/24, 9:50 AM - +263 78 759 9952: 2. What is psychology and how is it a science?

Psychology is the study of human mind and behavior.It looks at things like learning, memory and decision making. It's considered a science because it uses scientific methods to observe and describe how people think , feel and act.They  look at things like personality,  emotions, motivation and mental health. Psychologist use research data , observations,  analysis and experiments to test their hypothesis and theories about the human mind .This helps it better to understand human behavior and to develop treatments for mental health conditions.   In short psychology is a science because it relies on evidence and science methods as well as following rigorous and systematic process to learn about the human mind .
8/2/24, 10:17 AM - +263 78 759 9952: 3. What do you understand by Id , Ego and SuperEgo . Please explain giving examples. 

Id refers to one of the three parts of the human psyche. The id is the most basic primitive part of the psyche. It's driven by the pleasure principle which seeks to fulfill needs and desires without considering consequences. It is concerned with instant gratification and doesn't take the reality of situation into account. The other part of the psyche is the Ego that is contact with reality and helps to satisfy the id's need in a way that's socially acceptable and consistent with one's moral values .For example, imagine you're on a diet but you see your favorite dessert." Your id" might say "eat it you want it and it will make you happy" but your Ego is aware of the negative consequences of eating the dessert like feeling guilty or derailing your diet .The last part is the SuperEgo which is the part that's concerned with morals and whats wrong or right . Its like an internalized version of society rules and values.for example , a persons superego might tell them to be honest, treat others with respect and behave morally.  Its like an innner voice.
8/2/24, 11:03 AM - +263 78 759 9952: 4. Why do you think there is a stigma about mental or talking about mental health ? How do you think you will be able to remove that stigma and make it more acceptable to society .

There are a numner number of reasons why there is a stigma around mental health and talking about it. There's still a lot od misunderstanding and misinformation about mental health conditions.  Some people believe that mental health conditions are not real or are just "all in the head" this can make it difficult for people to seek help as they feel ashamed or afraid of being judged.  Additionally, there is still a lack of resources and support gor people with mental health conditions. This can make it difficult to access treatment and can futher contribute to the stigma. There are a nomber number of things that can be done to reduce the stigma and mental health and make it more acceptable.  First , its important to increase education and awareness about mantal health conditions . This can help dispel myth and misconceptions and create a more understanding and support environment. Secondly,  its important to make health services accessible and affordable.  This can make it easier for people to get help
8/2/24, 11:30 AM - +263 78 759 9952: 5. There is ongoing debate on whether early or late experience are important in determining aspects of later life . What is your opinion? Do early experience rule us for life . Justify  your answer.

Its true tht there has been a alot of debate about the relative importance of early and later experience in shaping a person's life . However , i don't think its a simple as sating that one is more important than the other . I think its a combination of both early and later experience that shape a persons life . Early experience can certainly have big impact especially when it comes to attachments , behaviors, feelings , and beliefs . Its also possible to change and grow throughout our lives . As we gain more experience  and learn new things . We can make different choices and develop new coping mechanisms. So while early experience can certainly have a lasting impact , they don't necessarily determine our entire lives.
8/2/24, 12:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Rutendo, Wishing you a wonderful day!
8/2/24, 12:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response for the Academic interview questions, May I kindly know if you have completed the SOP form as well ?

8/2/24, 12:27 PM - +263 78 759 9952: <Media omitted>
8/2/24, 12:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response regarding the SOP form and academic questions.  With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.
8/2/24, 12:28 PM - +263 78 759 9952: Yes
8/2/24, 12:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Tuesday (13-Feb-2024).
8/2/24, 12:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Tuesday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

8/2/24, 6:01 PM - +263 78 759 9952: Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is Ms aditi and shee has scheduled my session for 13 February .

Wishing you all the best as you begin this exciting chapter. May it be filled with learning, personal growth, and, above all, a genuine sense of accomplishment.
8/2/24, 6:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: On the same note, I would like to know if you are available for today's discussion ?
8/2/24, 6:04 PM - +263 78 759 9952: Thank you very much
8/2/24, 6:04 PM - +263 78 759 9952: Yew
8/2/24, 6:04 PM - +263 78 759 9952: Yes
8/2/24, 6:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome dear, With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
8/2/24, 6:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the same time, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BA (Psychology)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
8/2/24, 6:11 PM - +263 78 759 9952: Yes it is very accurate
8/2/24, 6:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
8/2/24, 6:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
8/2/24, 6:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
8/2/24, 6:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
8/2/24, 6:17 PM - +263 78 759 9952: Yes um well aware
8/2/24, 6:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
8/2/24, 6:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
8/2/24, 6:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
8/2/24, 6:21 PM - +263 78 759 9952: Yes
8/2/24, 6:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
8/2/24, 6:28 PM - +263 78 759 9952: Yes
8/2/24, 6:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*
8/2/24, 6:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
8/2/24, 7:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263787599952 May I know if you have gone through my messages ?
8/2/24, 7:17 PM - +263 78 759 9952: Yes i have
8/2/24, 7:17 PM - +263 78 759 9952: Yes
8/2/24, 7:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
8/2/24, 7:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
8/2/24, 7:20 PM - +263 78 759 9952: Very clear
8/2/24, 7:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
8/2/24, 7:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
8/2/24, 7:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
8/2/24, 7:23 PM - +263 78 759 9952: I understand very well
8/2/24, 7:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
8/2/24, 7:34 PM - +263 78 759 9952: Everything is understood
8/2/24, 7:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
8/2/24, 7:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
8/2/24, 7:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
8/2/24, 7:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
8/2/24, 7:46 PM - +263 78 759 9952: We are very excited
8/2/24, 7:47 PM - +263 78 759 9952: They indeed looked very happy ...can't wait ro be in the same position
8/2/24, 7:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed dear. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
8/2/24, 7:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
8/2/24, 8:01 PM - +263 78 759 9952: Yes um very excited kindly share the news
8/2/24, 8:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.
8/2/24, 8:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
8/2/24, 8:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
8/2/24, 8:09 PM - +263 78 759 9952: No um not
8/2/24, 8:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
8/2/24, 8:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
8/2/24, 8:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for February 15, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before February 15, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by March 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
8/2/24, 8:11 PM - +263 78 759 9952: Woow the payment method is very flexible...thank you very much .
8/2/24, 8:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Most welcome dear, Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
8/2/24, 8:35 PM - +263 78 759 9952: No
8/2/24, 8:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
8/2/24, 8:37 PM - +263 78 759 9952: Yes i am very excited
8/2/24, 8:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
8/2/24, 8:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful.

20/2/24, 9:31 AM - +263 78 759 9952: Thank you for understanding.  Yes we can discuss
20/2/24, 9:42 AM - Ashi Edoofa: As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
20/2/24, 9:42 AM - Ashi Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
20/2/24, 9:43 AM - +263 78 759 9952: Yes  it certainly work
20/2/24, 9:44 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
20/2/24, 9:44 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
20/2/24, 9:55 AM - +263 78 759 9952: 1 .The tuition fee per semester after the scholarship is 900USD
2 . Standard duration of my course is 3 years 
3. The admission fee and precedure fee is 300 USD 
4.The registration fee is 750 USD
20/2/24, 10:10 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
20/2/24, 10:14 AM - +263 78 759 9952: Yes this clarifies the tuition fee
20/2/24, 10:14 AM - +263 77 264 6599: Yes
20/2/24, 10:14 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
20/2/24, 10:15 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
20/2/24, 10:15 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
20/2/24, 10:19 AM - +263 77 264 6599: We want  her to stay at the campus
20/2/24, 10:19 AM - Ashi Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
20/2/24, 10:20 AM - +263 78 759 9952: So the on-campus accommodation is 2000 and not 2250 as recorded on the offer letter ?
20/2/24, 10:21 AM - Ashi Edoofa: @263787599952 The cost for on-campus accommodation may vary from $2000 to $2250, although don't worry the actual cost will be share when you will receive the admission acceptance letter and then we will assist you regarding the accommodatioin
20/2/24, 10:21 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
20/2/24, 10:22 AM - +263 78 759 9952: Ok i understand now
20/2/24, 10:23 AM - +263 78 759 9952: Yes very clear
20/2/24, 10:23 AM - +263 77 264 6599: Yes the  examination  fee is clear
20/2/24, 10:26 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
20/2/24, 10:27 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on February 29, 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
20/2/24, 10:28 AM - +263 77 264 6599: Yes
20/2/24, 10:29 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
20/2/24, 10:31 AM - +263 77 264 6599: Well done ,yes  explain please
20/2/24, 10:50 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. As the amount needed for the registration fee is $750, this $750 can be conveniently paid in two instalments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$375 before the first deadline date of 29th February, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$375  before the second deadline date of 29th March, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
20/2/24, 10:50 AM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $750 within 15 working days, before *February 29th, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
20/2/24, 10:54 AM - +263 77 264 6599: Yes we are opting to  pay$375  on the 27th of feb then the other 375 on the 27 of march
20/2/24, 10:57 AM - +263 77 264 6599: So does the $375 have additional  charges
20/2/24, 10:59 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
20/2/24, 10:59 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
20/2/24, 10:59 AM - +263 77 264 6599: Harare  .
20/2/24, 11:01 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
20/2/24, 11:01 AM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
20/2/24, 11:01 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
20/2/24, 11:05 AM - +263 77 264 6599: Thank you very , You people are wonderful  everthing is well planned
20/2/24, 11:09 AM - +263 77 264 6599: So  after paying our 750  when will the rest be paid excluding the accomodation  fee
20/2/24, 11:19 AM - Ashi Edoofa: The rest amount will be needed before the arrival please
20/2/24, 11:19 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
20/2/24, 11:20 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?

20/2/24, 11:22 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Perfect!
20/2/24, 11:22 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
20/2/24, 11:31 AM - +263 77 264 6599: We are still deciding  whether campus or off campus
20/2/24, 11:33 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
20/2/24, 11:33 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
20/2/24, 11:33 AM - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
20/2/24, 11:33 AM - Ashi Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
20/2/24, 11:35 AM - +263 77 264 6599: Yes l understood everthing  from the conference
20/2/24, 11:40 AM - Ashi Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.

This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
20/2/24, 11:43 AM - +263 77 264 6599: Very advantageous  it helps us a lot  as parent
