20/2/24, 4:56 PM - +263 78 530 5332: I attended the meet and greet event (slice-con24) from the 17th to the 19th since I was selected as a student coordinator. the whole session was informative and wonderful. I enjoyed it and got to know of the programs I can study under Edoofa. However,  the issue that's troubling me up to now is the fact that is it possible to change from BBA that I was given before to another program as I had mentioned previously.  From my responses from other Edoofians who were part of the coordinating team i had it was easy and possible for them to change
