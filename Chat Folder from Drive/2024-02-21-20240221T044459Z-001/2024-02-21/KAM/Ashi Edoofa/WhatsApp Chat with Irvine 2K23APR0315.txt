Thank you for sharing the payment receipt of your university Registration Fee. It has been duly noted with us and we have shared it with the accounts team as well for payment confirmation. 

Once the payment is confirmed by the accounts team and the amount has been reflected in India, we will notify you and the university officials accordingly.
16/1/24, 10:49 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Irvine,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 10:49 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 2:24 PM - +263 77 272 4645: Good afternoon ma'am. Yes results are out but unfortunately we couldn't  get them because the school os asking for the outstanding fees , so I'm running around to get the money. As soon as we get the results , i will send them to you.
17/1/24, 8:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Irvine.

Thank you for sharing this information with me. Certainly, you can share the results with us once you have them. I will look forward to an update from your end. Until then, please take care and have a blessed night!
