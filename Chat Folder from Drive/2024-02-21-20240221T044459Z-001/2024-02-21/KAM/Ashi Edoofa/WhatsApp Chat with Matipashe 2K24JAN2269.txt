13/2/24, 11:40 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Text @263773861078
13/2/24, 11:59 AM - +263 77 386 1078: Firstly , my name is Matipashe Prince Chiponda and i'm the only child in my small family. I'm a Zimbabwean citizen born into a humble family with constrained resources. With the situation at hand , education became my only hope. I worked tirelessly throughout my years in high school oftenly sacrificing my sleep and other social activities , fortunately my hardwork paid off. I then started to look for a conducive environment where i could study for my tertiary education in terms of a scholarship. In the quest , i found Edoofa meeting my needs. My father being a manager at a hardware company and my mother serving as a teacher in a private institution , i'm confident that in terms of scholarship they are capable of paying the remaining fees till i graduate. These individuals have been supporting , and they will be supporting my educational plans both finincially and morally. Thank you.
13/2/24, 12:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your inspiring journey. Your dedication and hard work are truly commendable. I'm thrilled to hear about your success and the support from your parents. I believe your determination will lead to continued success in your tertiary education. Wishing you all the best on this exciting new chapter!
13/2/24, 12:04 PM - +263 77 386 1078: You're welcome and thanks to you too.
13/2/24, 12:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome dear, Moving forward, I would like to bring an important aspect to your attention. The collective aim that we have for the student strongly values balanced involvement from parents, especially when the student is unable to participate. Your proactive engagement holds significant weight, and if, for any reason, either you or your guardians won't be available, we kindly request you to inform us beforehand so that we can plan and schedule our discussion beforehand. I hope you have taken note of this as well?
13/2/24, 12:08 PM - +263 77 386 1078: I'm available but with my guardians i'm not so sure as greater part of the day they'll be busy at work. It's wise to confirm with them.
13/2/24, 12:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @263773861078, In the meantime, Now over the next four days, our focus as your admission team will be on equipping you with a comprehensive understanding of what lies ahead in your university admission journey and help you commence the same.

We can move forward.
19/2/24, 10:07 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
19/2/24, 10:07 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
19/2/24, 10:07 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
19/2/24, 10:07 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear.
19/2/24, 10:10 AM - +263 77 386 1078: Yes
19/2/24, 10:10 AM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
19/2/24, 10:10 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
19/2/24, 10:11 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
19/2/24, 10:11 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
19/2/24, 10:11 AM - +263 77 386 1078: Following
19/2/24, 10:19 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -
19/2/24, 10:19 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
19/2/24, 10:19 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
19/2/24, 10:19 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
19/2/24, 10:20 AM - +263 77 386 1078: Crystal Clear.
19/2/24, 10:21 AM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
19/2/24, 10:23 AM - +263 77 386 1078: Yes
19/2/24, 10:25 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
19/2/24, 10:25 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
19/2/24, 10:26 AM - +263 77 386 1078: Yes , we can move forward

19/2/24, 10:31 AM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/2/24, 11:51 AM - +263 77 386 1078: From this video i assimilated that students who are enrolled in the Edoofa Program are grateful for the opportunites provided by the organization , the also feel a sense of independence due to the scholarship credits earned through the EWYL program. In order to lead a successful journey with Edoofa you must be open to learning , reachable and never blame circumstance for your failure. Last but not least , to reach your full potential as an Edoofian you must be able to follow instructions and be open-minded.
19/2/24, 11:53 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Please do let me know once you have watched all the videos
19/2/24, 12:04 PM - +263 77 386 1078: I realized that Edoofa doesn't only help you with scholarships but it also provide vast opportunities to an individual. At the end of the day it's up to the student to make use of all the opportunities available and  be open minded or to have a limited mindsent. Students must follow instructions and ask advice and guidance from their experts.
19/2/24, 12:20 PM - +263 77 386 1078: I've grasped that the Edoofa Team have invested a lot of time creating systems and relationships which help them associate with top-notch accredited universites. The team also make an effort to enroll the student into a varsity which makes the student employable and worth after graduation. A lot of time is invested in finding the student eligible through counselling sessions etc , this equips the students with basic skills like communication , confidence etc
19/2/24, 12:26 PM - +263 77 386 1078: I've noted that the SOP is an important document which will help me get admitted into a good varisty , it shows my capabilities and why i'm worth getting enrolled in the specified university
19/2/24, 12:26 PM - +263 77 386 1078: I've watched all the videos and the feedback is above.
Thank You.
19/2/24, 12:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
19/2/24, 12:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
19/2/24, 12:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
19/2/24, 12:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
19/2/24, 12:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
19/2/24, 12:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?

So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
20/2/24, 1:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier.
