21/12/23, 9:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Blessing.

I trust you're all in good health. I wanted to reach out today, as the second deadline is drawing near. Hence I wanted to check on your preparations for this and to inquire about your plans, especially considering the upcoming festival season. Could you please let me know which date you have in mind to make the payment for the second deadline?
21/12/23, 9:49 PM - +263 77 665 3491: Evening Madam how are you
21/12/23, 9:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great.
21/12/23, 9:51 PM - +263 77 665 3491: I will be paying the remaining $300 on 29 December 2003
21/12/23, 9:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, however, please note that since it will be the festival season the banks can be closed and it will affect your deadline date.
26/12/23, 3:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Blessing,

I trust this message finds you well and in high spirits. As I was organizing my day today, I took the opportunity to review your scholarship application file. I observed that the remaining amount of $330 for your university registration fee is due before January 1, 2024. Consequently, I wanted to reach out since you have not responded to our previous message.

How is your preparation going forward? Have you been able to raise the outstanding amount of $330 by now?
26/12/23, 3:51 PM - +263 77 665 3491: Afternoon Madam.
26/12/23, 3:53 PM - +263 77 665 3491: Yes the remaining amount is $330 bt am not done and i think i will get the total amount on 29 December and do the payment on the same day
26/12/23, 3:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for the update. I have duly noted the information and will inform both the accounts team and the university officials accordingly. 

However, as we are currently in the festive season, there's a possibility that you might encounter unforeseen challenges at the bank. 

To be on the side of caution, we advise making the payment a day in advance. This precaution ensures you have a backup day, minimizing the risk of losing out on the entire opportunity. I trust you have taken note of our recommendation?
26/12/23, 3:57 PM - +263 77 665 3491: Yes Madam
26/12/23, 3:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Have a great day ahead and do convey my regards to your parents as well.
26/12/23, 4:02 PM - +263 77 665 3491: Thank you

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing the payment receipt for the last part of your university registration fee, we have duly noted it. Our accounts team is currently processing the same receipts for payment confirmation.

Once the payment is verified, we will update your scholarship application accordingly. Additionally, we will notify the university authorities about the payment for their records to ensure a smooth visa process.

16/1/24, 1:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Blessing,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 1:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 9:37 PM - +263 78 715 1013: Good evening let me share my A level results with you

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
17/1/24, 8:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly allow us some time to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, we will reconnect with you to discuss the next steps in your academic journey.
