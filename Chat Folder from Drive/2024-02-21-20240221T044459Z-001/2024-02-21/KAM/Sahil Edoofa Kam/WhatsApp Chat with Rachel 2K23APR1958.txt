16/1/24, 12:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Rachel

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

18/1/24, 7:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

18/1/24, 7:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly allow us time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, Mr. Sahil, the senior career counselor at Edoofa will connect with you to guide you on the next steps in your academic career.

*I am Ms.Harmehak,Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction, I remembered that during our session you portrayed an enormous potential of becoming a leader of tomorrow. Hence I have asked my Colleague *Mr.Sahil, Senior Academician* to personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority. 

Hence I request you to come online and continue with your admission procedures.
22/1/24, 4:37 PM - +263 71 320 6319: Good day Ms Harmehak

Thank you for introducing me to Mr Sahil.
23/1/24, 11:00 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning,

*I am Mr. Sahil, Senior Academician*

Your name recently caught my attention as I reviewed your Admissions Group. I was surprised to learn that you haven't completed the University registration process despite being a bright student. I still recall your passion for your career and goals, especially during the evaluation phase based on the special recommendation of Ms. Harmehak, making you one of my favorite students. Following a discussion with the Admissions Head, have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed earlier and what are your plans as of now?
23/1/24, 9:34 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: let's schedule our discussion for tomorrow at 9 AM CAT. If you face challenges or need a different time, let me know in this group. Success often comes from open communication about concerns.

How are you?
24/1/24, 10:15 AM - +263 77 252 4960: I am sorry to inform you that we may be withdrawing from the program because of financial challenges.
24/1/24, 12:12 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Certainly. Could you please elaborate on the challenges you are currently facing? This information will enable me to engage in discussions with the board and explore the possibility of securing a higher quantum of scholarship or proposing a flexible plan that suits your circumstances.
24/1/24, 1:56 PM - +263 77 252 4960: Good afternoon Mr Sahil, thank you for asking.

1.I have developed three  challenges that would require concurrent financing;

(a) An ill elder sister, newly diagnosed with dementia who is now under my care as her husband could not come to terms with her condition.

(b) My son (second born) who has not fully completed his mining course who also needs sponsorship.

(c) Rachel who needs financing for her tertiary education.

2. Poor remuneration for both my wife and my self both employed as nurses in Zimbabwe... prevailing economic challenges.

The above factors combined, threatens the sustainability of financing Rachel's tertiary education.

Thank you!
24/1/24, 2:21 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Thank you for sharing your challenges. I understand that the current situation involves multiple financial responsibilities, especially with the health condition of your elder sister and the education needs of your son and Rachel. Given this, I'm keen to explore potential solutions that can help address these concerns. Could you please provide more details on the specific financial support you would require for Rachel's tertiary education? This will assist me in discussing a tailored plan or additional scholarship options with the board.
24/1/24, 4:27 PM - +263 77 252 4960: Thank you for your concern Sir and for showing some willingness to explore potential solutions. Let me come back to you later, I am still at work until 2100hr.
