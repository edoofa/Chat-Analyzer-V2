This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.

I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
13/1/24, 2:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Emily,
13/1/24, 2:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
13/1/24, 2:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
13/1/24, 2:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
16/1/24, 7:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Emily,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. I was hoping to get a response from your end following my previous messages. However, in recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 7:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
17/1/24, 4:37 AM - +263 77 306 2654: <Media omitted>
17/1/24, 9:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Emily.

Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
17/1/24, 9:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly allow us some time to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, we will reconnect with you to discuss the next steps in your academic journey.

*I am Mr Sahil, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*

If you remember well, I hosted the counselling and evaluation sessions for you through the Edoofa Scholarship Program from which you have made me proud by qualifying for the program.

22/1/24, 12:58 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Recalling our counseling and evaluation sessions, I take pride in your qualification for our esteemed Edoofa Scholarship Program. Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
22/1/24, 1:02 PM - +263 77 306 2654: Thank you for your concern. I personally cant afford
22/1/24, 2:21 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Which part of the fees are you concerned for now please?
22/1/24, 2:25 PM - +263 77 306 2654: Admission fee
22/1/24, 2:46 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Are you more concerned about the timeframe/duration of the payment, or is your concern primarily about the amount?
22/1/24, 2:51 PM - +263 77 306 2654: The amount
22/1/24, 2:55 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: May I inquire about your plans now that the A-level results are out? Have you explored the fee structures of renowned public universities in Zimbabwe?
22/1/24, 3:05 PM - +263 77 306 2654: Yes
22/1/24, 3:14 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Have you compiled the costs and compared with cost of Education in India ?
22/1/24, 3:15 PM - +263 77 306 2654: Yes its cheaper for me this side
22/1/24, 4:03 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: No, it's not at all do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats, however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge.  Having Conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

22/1/24, 4:08 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I am shocked to compile these data for Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities of Zimbabwe.

*Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE)* -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - *($680 per term)*

*Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT)* https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - *($535 per term)*

*University of Zimbabwe (UZ)* -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm *($523 per term)*

NUST -*($870 per term)*

*I am sure you and your family must have also discussed this,*. So what have you decided for your future ahead?
22/1/24, 4:10 PM - +263 77 306 2654: Yes i am aware of that
23/1/24, 10:10 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: If we calculate the expenses, the cost will surpass what you are paying in India with the scholarship. This implies that if Emily studies in Zimbabwe, the expenses will be much higher right ?
23/1/24, 9:33 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: let's schedule our discussion for tomorrow at 9 AM CAT. If you face challenges or need a different time, let me know in this group. Success often comes from open communication about concerns. @263780157069 @263732903588 @263773062654
24/1/24, 8:45 AM - +263 77 306 2654: I understand your concern and am also wondering why my decision is not being considered in this case.  Are you also considering that even your admission fee is far much than the fees per semester at most local universities. I have reconsidered enrolling them at a local university. Its affordable and flexible for me considering my earnings. Unless you are telling me that you are going to take care of all the expenses. Thank you
24/1/24, 10:01 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I acknowledge the challenges you're facing. Perhaps there could be a miscalculation in estimating the finances required for studying abroad compared to a local university. If you're available, we can discuss this further over a call.
