5/1/24, 4:31 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Precious.
5/1/24, 4:31 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed for quite some time now. I can also see that you have seen my messages. This has raised some concerns on my part, which is affecting your scholarship application. As we have already mentioned before, we will be proceeding with your admission process after *August 2023*. It has already been 5 months now.

I understand that there might be challenges regarding this. Hence, if you're ready now, please let me know so that we can proceed with the session, or let me know if you are facing any challenges so that we can discuss this better. <This message was edited>
5/1/24, 4:35 PM - +263 71 257 6605: Good day sir. Definitely wanted to proceed with the registration but surely things in Zimbabwe have fallen apart. The economy is dysfunctional and raising the required funds is a challenge. Dont know if the situation can be helped.
5/1/24, 7:01 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The current situation in Zimbabwe has indeed presented significant challenges, particularly in terms of the economic instability, making it difficult to raise the required funds for the registration. May I know if you have made any plans on regards to the higher education?
5/1/24, 7:02 PM - +263 71 257 6605: Currently am tying to mobilise funds for local colleges
5/1/24, 7:08 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. May I know if you are able to select the university of your choice?
5/1/24, 7:10 PM - +263 71 257 6605: If she scores higher mark will choose university of Zimbabwe as first priority and it is my prayer that there won't be challenges again.
5/1/24, 7:13 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's understandable. Education is crucial, and navigating these challenges showcases your determination.
5/1/24, 7:18 PM - +263 71 257 6605: Thank you so much.
6/1/24, 1:42 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Parents of Precious,

I am *Mr. Shivjeet, and I serve as the Admission Officer at Edoofa.* I wanted to extend my heartfelt wishes to you and your family for a prosperous and fulfilling 2024. 

I firmly believe that with the commencement of this new year, comes the promise of fresh beginnings, guiding the way for the actualization of one's deepest dreams and aspirations. As we stand on the threshold of this promising year, I am filled with excitement for the adventures it holds.
6/1/24, 1:42 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the same spirit, I would like to share that I am embarking on a journey as I prepare myself to pursue my doctorate and take a step forward in my academic pursuits. This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.
6/1/24, 1:42 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The decision to transition to a new phase in my life presents an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of students, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience remain enriched and fulfilling.

As I embark on this new journey, I want to assure you that I have entrusted your application file to capable hands. From this point forward, your admission journey will be seamlessly guided by one of our accomplished admission officers, *Ms. Siddhi,* who will connect with you on Tuesday.  I hope you will make yourself available for further procedures and will give your best to your career.
6/1/24, 1:42 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments. Wish you all the best, and God Bless.

Regards,
Mr. Shiveet
Edoofa Admission Team.
8/1/24, 2:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Precious,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honoured to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
8/1/24, 2:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
8/1/24, 2:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 2:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
16/1/24, 7:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Precious,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. I was hoping to get a response from your end following my previous messages. However, in recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 7:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
29/1/24, 9:01 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good Day @263712576605 @263773265152 , 
*I am Mr Sahil, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*

If you remember well, I hosted the counselling and evaluation sessions for you through the Edoofa Scholarship Program from which you have made me proud by qualifying for the program.

29/1/24, 9:01 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 9:01 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Recalling our counseling and evaluation sessions, I take pride in your qualification for our esteemed Edoofa Scholarship Program. Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
29/1/24, 11:32 AM - +263 71 257 6605: Good day sir and team. Currently the economic situation in Zimbabwe is low to an extent that we couldn't raise the required funds hence us sending her to a local university. Once funds permit, we will always find a way to sending her there.
29/1/24, 12:44 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I personally noticed challenges in your admission process, so I'm here to help. Despite not being part of the admission team, as a member of the academic bench, I'll personally ensure your application is completed within three days, securing the maximum scholarship percentage possible .This will make your education more affordable than studying locally and open up maximum employment prospects. Trust me to handle everything, and let's start fresh for a successful outcome. As a dedicated effort, I'm providing you with the option to call me directly if there are any delays in the process.
29/1/24, 12:44 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Can you please share your A level results ?
29/1/24, 12:45 PM - +263 71 257 6605: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 1:28 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Congratulations! For qualifying the Advanced Levels. The time has come when you and your family have to now make rational decisions as this is an impactful turning point in your career.
29/1/24, 1:29 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats, however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge.  Having Conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

29/1/24, 1:29 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 1:29 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I am shocked to compile these data for Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities of Zimbabwe.

Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE) -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - ($680 per term)

Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT) https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - ($535 per term)

University of Zimbabwe (UZ) -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm ($523 per term)

NUST -($870 per term)

I'm sure you and your family have discussed this thoroughly. What decisions have you made for your future? Considering the cost and employment opportunities, have you compared the benefits of studying in India with the Edoofa program against other options?
29/1/24, 1:41 PM - +263 71 257 6605: We are weighing all options available to us and will see how it goes
29/1/24, 2:37 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Thats means $600*2 semester $1200 per year for tution fees $200 per year for internship 

$70 a month rent * 12 months = $840 a year for accommodation

Basic 3 meal sadza a day $1 per meal *3 meals a day *365 days = $1095 

Data bundles - $ 50 a month right * 12 months = $600 

Misc- $300 

Total at UZ = Exceeds $4100
29/1/24, 2:37 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Where as at Edoofa at top universities abroad you are only paying $2000-$3000 also complementary you are getting EWYL program to self finance the fees so which one is affordable ?
29/1/24, 8:00 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 8:36 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Good morning Everyone!*  let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*"As the scriptures teach, knowledge is a steadfast companion. A person enlightened by wisdom is held in high regard across all realms. The brilliance of education surpasses the allure of beauty and the vigor of youth."*

 With positive energy, let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education. So shall we begin ?
30/1/24, 6:52 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I was anticipating your response today but unfortunately, you were not available all day. I look forward to your active participation tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT time. I am eager for our interaction. As we embark on a new day, let's reflect on the wisdom from Proverbs 3:5-6 (NIV): *'Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.'*
31/1/24, 10:05 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Good morning Everyone!*

*“It is impossible for a man to learn what he thinks he already knows.”*

With positive energy, let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education. So shall we begin ?
31/1/24, 10:09 AM - +263 71 257 6605: Good morning
31/1/24, 10:26 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Can you please answer this?
31/1/24, 10:29 AM - +263 71 257 6605: Affordability is fine but as it stands we can not promise if the fee can be raised considering passports, visa and travel funds
31/1/24, 12:18 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: May i know who left the group ?
1/2/24, 8:58 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning!
I hope you're well. I sincerely apologize for the delay yesterday; I was engaged in a meeting. Thank you for your patience. As we resume our discussion, I'm reminded of Proverbs 16:3 (NIV): *"Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and he will establish your plans."* Shall we proceed with our decision now?
2/2/24, 9:14 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Good Morning Everyone*

*I hope you're well. I noticed my previous messages were read, but I haven't received a response.* Your open communication is crucial for me to understand your situation better. *As a member of the Academic board, I can personally assist you in securing a higher percentage of scholarship* possible if you share your concerns openly.Please feel free to share any specific details. Thank you, and I look forward to your response.
2/2/24, 9:24 AM - +263 71 257 6605: Morning team. As I always highlight in all communications that Zimbabwe is currently a dead country interms of economic perfomance and it's making it very difficult to raise funds that are required. Consider visa, travel, passport and all that requires funding
2/2/24, 11:00 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I completely understand the economic challenges in Zimbabwe. It's indeed a tough situation. However, consider this as an investment in your future. While the initial expenses for visas, travel, and passports may seem daunting, the education abroad is a one-time sacrifice that has the potential to change the trajectory of your family's life forever. We've seen students from the University of Zimbabwe struggling even after their masters, working at gas stations or selling SIM cards on the streets. A move abroad for education can open up opportunities that may not be easily available in the current economic climate. 

Nut now if you stay there and invest on your education in Zimbabwe then in coming years there will be no way out and it would be very difficult to put bread on table for your family.
3/2/24, 8:10 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning
How are you doing today?
5/2/24, 9:11 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning! let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*Proverbs 2:10-11 (NIV):*
*"For wisdom will enter your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul. Discretion will protect you, and understanding will guard you."*

Let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education
5/2/24, 7:21 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Embrace education as the key to a brighter future. Proverbs 4:7 (NIV) wisely states, "The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom." Seize the opportunity to break free from limitations. Keep in mind Philippians 4:13 (NIV), "I can do all this through him who gives me strength." Let education empower your child!*

Over the past few days, we've been trying to connect with you to discuss your child's academic journey. We understand the financial commitments involved in providing quality education for your child. The challenges in Africa, particularly the uncertainty of employment after completing a bachelor's degree, are evident.

Considering the urgency of your child's education, I've scheduled a session for *tomorrow at 09:30 AM CAT* .Looking forward to connecting with you tomorrow.
6/2/24, 9:35 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning! let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*Proverbs 1:5:*

*"Let the wise listen and add to their learning.' In the tapestry of progress, education is the thread that weaves nations together. As India seeks wisdom, let us prioritize education, creating a future where knowledge transcends boundaries and resonates more profoundly than ever. A commitment to learning is a commitment to a thriving, united nation."*

Let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education ,Shall we start?
