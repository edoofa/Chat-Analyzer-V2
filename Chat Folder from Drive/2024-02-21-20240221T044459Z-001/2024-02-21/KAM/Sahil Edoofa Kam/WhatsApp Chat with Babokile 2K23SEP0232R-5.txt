8/1/24, 12:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Babokile !

I trust this message reaches you in good health. I have been looking forward to the response from your side, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed for quite some time now. This has raised some concerns on my part, which is affecting your scholarship application. 

I am more than willing to continue with your journey, Hence I wanted to understand if there is something that is bothering you. If you're ready now, please let me know so that we can proceed with the discussion. If my understanding is correct, I am assuming that you have something that you want to share with us, right?
16/1/24, 12:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Babokile,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
29/1/24, 9:42 AM - Harmehak Edoofa: Good Day @263773881615 @263771039593 @263787077037 ⁩ , 

I am Ms.Harmehak,Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction, I remembered that during our session you portrayed an enormous potential of becoming a leader of tomorrow. Hence I have asked my Colleague Mr.Sahil, Senior Academician @919821838532 ⁩ to personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority. 

Hence I request you to come online and continue with your admission procedures.
29/1/24, 4:19 PM - +263 77 388 1615: Hello I am sorry I haven't been available for quite sometime 
Babokile did very well but unfortunately I don't think he will be able to enroll with you due to financial constraints
29/1/24, 4:20 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good Day , 
*I am Mr Sahil, Senior Academician at Edoofa* <This message was edited>
29/1/24, 4:20 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I personally noticed challenges in your admission process, so I'm here to help. Despite not being part of the admission team, as a member of the academic bench, I'll personally ensure your application is completed within three days, securing the maximum scholarship percentage possible .This will make your education more affordable than studying locally and open up maximum employment prospects. Trust me to handle everything, and let's start fresh for a successful outcome. As a dedicated effort, I'm providing you with the option to call me directly if there are any delays in the process.
29/1/24, 4:20 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
29/1/24, 7:58 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 9:53 PM - +263 77 388 1615: Ok thank you
30/1/24, 8:43 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Good morning Everyone!*  let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*"As the scriptures teach, knowledge is a steadfast companion. A person enlightened by wisdom is held in high regard across all realms. The brilliance of education surpasses the allure of beauty and the vigor of youth."*

 With positive energy, let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education. So shall we begin ?
30/1/24, 6:58 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I was anticipating your response today but unfortunately, you were not available all day. I look forward to your active participation tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT time. I am eager for our interaction. As we embark on a new day, let's reflect on the wisdom from Proverbs 3:5-6 (NIV): *'Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.'*
31/1/24, 10:17 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Good morning Everyone!*

*“It is impossible for a man to learn what he thinks he already knows.”*

With positive energy, let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education. So shall we begin ?
1/2/24, 8:47 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning!
I trust you are doing well. I've observed that my messages have been read but not responded to. In moments of silence, I'm reminded of Psalm 37:7 (NIV): "Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him." Is everything alright?
1/2/24, 10:52 AM - +263 77 388 1615: Good morning
1/2/24, 1:53 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Could you please provide an honest explanation for the delay in the process ? Given that A-level results are now available, there's a sense of urgency among students to secure places at top universities. The rapid filling of university seats is a common trend, and delays could limit options as the best opportunities are often claimed swiftly.
2/2/24, 3:37 AM - +263 77 388 1615: Good morning I am not sure whether its appropriate to call this 'delays' when I have already communicated that I could not proceed due to financial constraints
2/2/24, 8:44 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: This message was deleted
2/2/24, 8:45 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Please understand that as a member of the academic board, I hold some influence. If you openly share your concerns with me, especially specific details, I can personally assist you in securing a higher percentage of scholarship.
3/2/24, 8:07 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning
How are you doing today?
4/2/24, 7:02 AM - +263 77 388 1615: Good morning sir I am very well thank you
5/2/24, 9:09 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning! let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*Proverbs 2:10-11 (NIV):*
*"For wisdom will enter your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul. Discretion will protect you, and understanding will guard you."*

Let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education
5/2/24, 7:21 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Embrace education as the key to a brighter future. Proverbs 4:7 (NIV) wisely states, "The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom." Seize the opportunity to break free from limitations. Keep in mind Philippians 4:13 (NIV), "I can do all this through him who gives me strength." Let education empower your child!*

Over the past few days, we've been trying to connect with you to discuss your child's academic journey. We understand the financial commitments involved in providing quality education for your child. The challenges in Africa, particularly the uncertainty of employment after completing a bachelor's degree, are evident.

Considering the urgency of your child's education, I've scheduled a session for *tomorrow at 09:30 AM CAT* .Looking forward to connecting with you tomorrow.
6/2/24, 9:35 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning! let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*Proverbs 1:5:*

*"Let the wise listen and add to their learning.' In the tapestry of progress, education is the thread that weaves nations together. As India seeks wisdom, let us prioritize education, creating a future where knowledge transcends boundaries and resonates more profoundly than ever. A commitment to learning is a commitment to a thriving, united nation."*

Let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education ,Shall we start?
6/2/24, 10:50 AM - +263 78 707 7037: This is.. i no longer want to go to India 🤷🏽‍♂️
6/2/24, 11:02 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Could you please clarify the rationale behind your initial payment of the enrollment fees, especially considering your apparent change in the decision to study in India? I encourage you to openly discuss any factors or influences that led to this shift in plans. Are you considering a change in the course, or is it financial concerns that are influencing these decisions?
6/2/24, 11:04 AM - +263 78 707 7037: Course hasnt changed i already got a place in the local university NUST u should check it out
6/2/24, 11:38 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: In which course can you please share the letter ? You are paying $600 -$650 per term for tuition  right at NUST
6/2/24, 11:45 AM - +263 78 707 7037: Thing is ion want to an 1000miles away from home and you cant fight that
6/2/24, 11:55 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Choosing to make short-term sacrifices for education now could pave the way for a more prosperous future. On the other hand, remaining in your comfort zone might lead to a lifetime of working far from home, possibly in jobs with limited opportunities, such as in mines, selling SIM cards on the road, or taking up minimum-wage positions. Missing out on quality education today may result in a prolonged struggle for meaningful employment, even after graduating from a top university in Zimbabwe. Consider the potential consequences and decide on the path that aligns with your long-term goals and aspirations.

I understand its difficult but don't worry we have a huge community of student fro your country and it would like a second home and we will be there like your second family.
6/2/24, 3:52 PM - +263 78 707 7037: Thank you but am good
6/2/24, 3:54 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Can you please share how are planning your future if you don't get any job after completing degree from NUST?
6/2/24, 3:56 PM - +263 78 707 7037: Ill sell sim cards on the road.....
6/2/24, 4:03 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: In such a scenario, does it truly justify investing your hard-earned family money if your ultimate goal is to sell SIM cards? Pursuing a degree from a reputable university and country is typically aimed at broader career prospects, professional growth, and acquiring skills that go beyond entry-level jobs, ensuring a more promising and fulfilling future right ?
6/2/24, 4:05 PM - +263 78 707 7037: Not everyone wants to go to India and jus one of those people.... I was born here and ild like to stay here
6/2/24, 4:08 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: When you reserved your seat for Edoofa you were ready to study in India Right ?
6/2/24, 4:08 PM - +263 78 707 7037: Yess now am not
6/2/24, 4:10 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Can you please share what factors or changes in your circumstances led to your decision of not wanting to study in India now, especially considering that you were initially prepared to do so when you reserved your seat with Edoofa?
6/2/24, 4:16 PM - +263 78 707 7037: Like i said i wuld like to be closer to home
6/2/24, 4:19 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Are you connected with any student in India?
6/2/24, 4:19 PM - +263 78 707 7037: Yess
7/2/24, 9:09 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good Afternoon Parents and Bobokile
