16/1/24, 11:39 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Alex,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 11:39 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 2:57 PM - +263 71 455 7432: Good afternoon
16/1/24, 2:58 PM - +263 71 455 7432: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 2:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results with us. I noticed that your A-level results didn't turn out as we had hoped, particularly with the challenge in one subject. However, I want to take a moment to remind you that this result is not a reflection of your abilities or potential. It's simply a hurdle on your academic journey, one that you are more than capable of overcoming.
16/1/24, 2:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It's important to remember that everyone faces setbacks at some point. What matters most is how we respond to them. This is an opportunity for growth and learning. Reflect on the experience, identify areas for improvement, and use this as a stepping stone towards future successes.
16/1/24, 2:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Rest assured, that you have Edoofa’s full support in navigating this phase. Whether it's discussing options for retaking the exam, exploring alternative career paths, or just needing someone to guide you, we are here for you. 

I have taken note of your results and I will add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
16/1/24, 3:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly allow us time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, Mr. Sahil, the senior career counselor at Edoofa will connect with you to guide you on the next steps in your academic career.
16/1/24, 3:09 PM - +263 71 455 7432: Yes maam
16/1/24, 3:11 PM - +263 71 455 7432: Unfortunately I'm having financial problems with pushing for my education abroad
16/1/24, 4:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright please, I understand please do not worry Mr. Sahil will assist you.
22/1/24, 12:35 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good Day Alex, 
*I am Mr Sahil, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*

If you remember well, I hosted the counselling and evaluation sessions for you through the Edoofa Scholarship Program from which you have made me proud by qualifying for the program.

22/1/24, 12:35 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Recalling our counseling and evaluation sessions, I take pride in your qualification for our esteemed Edoofa Scholarship Program. Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
22/1/24, 9:21 PM - +263 71 455 7432: Thank you very much sir
22/1/24, 9:21 PM - +263 71 455 7432: The family can't raise enough money for education abroad or even tertiary education here in Zimbabwe. We still have eyes and vision on The EDOOFA Scholarship that l received but financially we're not fully equipped to tackle the funds that are needed
22/1/24, 9:24 PM - +263 71 455 7432: I was offered Early Admission and was to pay 600 dollars for admission 

Raising that amount was a goal we failed to reach as a family in the given space of time
23/1/24, 11:36 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Since results are out you won't get Early benefits now .
23/1/24, 11:40 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Given the missed deadline at Galgotias university, I'm keen to know the amount of funds your family has secured thus far?
23/1/24, 6:47 PM - +263 71 455 7432: We'll inforn u after we talk tonight <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 8:46 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I will connect with you *tomorrow again at 09:15 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!

30/1/24, 8:41 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Good morning Everyone!*  let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*"As the scriptures teach, knowledge is a steadfast companion. A person enlightened by wisdom is held in high regard across all realms. The brilliance of education surpasses the allure of beauty and the vigor of youth."*

 With positive energy, let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education. So shall we begin ?
30/1/24, 8:42 AM - +263 71 455 7432: Good morning sir
30/1/24, 8:42 AM - +263 71 455 7432: We may begin

30/1/24, 10:50 AM - +263 71 455 7432: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 12:22 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats, however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge.  Having Conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

30/1/24, 12:22 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I am shocked to compile these data for Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities of Zimbabwe.

Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE) -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - ($680 per term)

Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT) https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - ($535 per term)

University of Zimbabwe (UZ) -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm ($523 per term)

NUST -($870 per term)

I'm sure you and your family have discussed this thoroughly. What decisions have you made for your future? Considering the cost and employment opportunities, have you compared the benefits of studying in India with the Edoofa program against other options?
30/1/24, 12:23 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: : Thats means $600*2 semester $1200 per year for tution fees $200 per year for internship 

$70 a month rent * 12 months = $840 a year for accommodation

Basic 3 meal sadza a day $1 per meal *3 meals a day *365 days = $1095 

Data bundles - $ 50 a month right * 12 months = $600 

Misc- $300 

Total at UZ = Exceeds $4100
Have you calculated this ?
Where as at Edoofa at top universities abroad you are only paying $2000-$3000 also complementary you are getting EWYL program to self finance the fees so which one is affordable ?
30/1/24, 7:01 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I was anticipating your response today but unfortunately, you were not available all day. I look forward to your active participation tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT time. I am eager for our interaction. As we embark on a new day, let's reflect on the wisdom from Proverbs 3:5-6 (NIV): *'Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.'*
30/1/24, 9:06 PM - +263 71 455 7432: We understand this sir 

But raising a huge sum all at once might be a problem.  My mother was suggesting a gap year.  So we can raise the money for every thing
31/1/24, 10:23 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Good morning Everyone!*

*“It is impossible for a man to learn what he thinks he already knows.”*

With positive energy, let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education. So shall we begin ?
