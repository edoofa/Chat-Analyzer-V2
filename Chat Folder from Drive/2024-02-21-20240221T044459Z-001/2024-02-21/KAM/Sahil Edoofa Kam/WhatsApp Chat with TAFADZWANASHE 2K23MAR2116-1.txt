I firmly believe that with the commencement of this new year, comes the promise of fresh beginnings, guiding the way for the actualization of one's deepest dreams and aspirations. As we stand on the threshold of this promising year, I am filled with excitement for the adventures it holds.
11/1/24, 1:00 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the same spirit, I would like to share that I am embarking on a journey as I prepare myself to pursue my doctorate and take a step forward in my academic pursuits. This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.
11/1/24, 1:00 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The decision to transition to a new phase in my life presents an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of students, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience remain enriched and fulfilling.

As I embark on this new journey, I want to assure you that I have entrusted your application file to capable hands. From this point forward, your admission journey will be seamlessly guided by one of our accomplished admission officers, *Ms. Siddhi,* who will connect with you on Tuesday.  I hope you will make yourself available for further procedures and will give your best to your career.
11/1/24, 1:00 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments. Wish you all the best, and God Bless.

16/1/24, 3:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tafadzwanashe,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honoured to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
16/1/24, 3:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
16/1/24, 3:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
16/1/24, 3:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
16/1/24, 7:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Tafadzwanashe,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. I was hoping to get a response from your end following my previous messages. However, in recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 7:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

27/1/24, 11:59 AM - +263 71 800 1668: Greetings mentors. This is TAFADZWANASHE JAKA. My ewylgroup is TAFADZWANASHE EWYL23E0093. I had been logged out of this group when l had whatsapp problems.
I have talked to my EWYL mentor about my a level results which were not really good. Please assist me if there is any hope l would be accepted in any university in India or if my results are not good, can they offer diplomas and apprenticeships so that one get the education needed to go to university.
29/1/24, 8:57 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good Day @263718001668 , 
*I am Mr Sahil, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*

If you remember well, I hosted the counselling and evaluation sessions for you through the Edoofa Scholarship Program from which you have made me proud by qualifying for the program.
29/1/24, 8:57 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 8:57 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 8:58 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Recalling our counseling and evaluation sessions, I take pride in your qualification for our esteemed Edoofa Scholarship Program. Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
29/1/24, 9:25 AM - +263 71 800 1668: Greetings. When we last spoke it was before l wrote my A level in July 2023 and l was doing EWYL. I then got logged out of WhatsApp, even losing my EWYL group but l contacted my mentor directly and she added me to the the group numerous times until my whatsapp was stable.
Upon receiving my results, l managed to have to A level subjects and the third subject zimsec did not provide my result due to cala complications, although l wrote all the papers. I was disappointed and seeing that most of my peers who got an opportunity to study in India had flying colors.
This is the reason why l delayed contacting you when lost the ADMISSION group.

During my counselling you mentioned that the scholarship also looks at the performance of the student and my performance was not good.
Also l didn't think l would get enrolled in any prestigious university in India looking at my results.

My plans now were to hear from you how many passes one needs to get into university. If it is impossible and  l will accept whatever case it may be. This is why l had told my parent to wait since we didn't know if it was still possible.
29/1/24, 10:41 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Please can you add your parents to group so that I can make arrangements for you immediately , also please share your A level results.
29/1/24, 10:42 AM - +263 71 800 1668: Alright
29/1/24, 10:44 AM - +263 71 800 1668: I'm only in contact with my mother.My parents separated and we hardly communicate with my father wherever he is. I will add her.

29/1/24, 12:51 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: May I know why did you miss Accounting exam ?
29/1/24, 1:14 PM - +263 71 800 1668: I wrote the exams and l also sent a complain to zimsec. We have continuous assessment tests that we write before the final exams, so it happened that the Zimsec teachers did not attach my marks  so that l can receive the results. We were allowed to use the previous year's continuous assessment marks that's why even in mathematics l got my results using the previous cala.
29/1/24, 2:00 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: What was the final outcome ?
29/1/24, 2:41 PM - +263 71 800 1668: I'm yet to receive a reply from zimsec.
The cala marks we were not told.
29/1/24, 3:17 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Did you get in touch with your school head ?
29/1/24, 3:44 PM - +263 71 800 1668: Yes. When l collected the results l told him then he took a photocopy and told me he was going to sent a complain to zimsec.
29/1/24, 4:33 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Okay so by when are you expecting to to hear from them?
29/1/24, 7:46 PM - +263 71 800 1668: I will try to ask tomorrow and l will let you know their response.
29/1/24, 7:55 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 8:34 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Good morning Everyone!*  let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*"As the scriptures teach, knowledge is a steadfast companion. A person enlightened by wisdom is held in high regard across all realms. The brilliance of education surpasses the allure of beauty and the vigor of youth."*

 With positive energy, let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education. So shall we begin ?
30/1/24, 8:52 AM - +263 71 800 1668: Good morning.
30/1/24, 8:56 AM - +263 71 800 1668: I will not be able to know when zimsec will respond since it is not stated how much time they take. Im sure that the complaint reached zimsec.
30/1/24, 12:31 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: How are you doing today ?
30/1/24, 3:31 PM - +263 71 800 1668: I am doing well thank you.
30/1/24, 3:52 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Have you researched about the cutoff point at local universities ?
30/1/24, 4:01 PM - +263 71 800 1668: Yes l did.
30/1/24, 4:03 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: So what is the cut off for your desired course ?
30/1/24, 4:19 PM - +263 71 800 1668: Well,They require high grades in math's and computer science and physics for computer science and sometimes *information* *technology* course, with 2 A level subjects with computer science,, depending on the university.
30/1/24, 4:23 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Its 12 POINTS FOR IT in UZ
30/1/24, 4:29 PM - +263 71 800 1668: Yes. Those are the best universities in Zimbabwe.
30/1/24, 4:42 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Even Chinhoyi and Bindura hai 10 Points .
30/1/24, 4:47 PM - +263 71 800 1668: Yes
30/1/24, 4:48 PM - +263 71 800 1668: It's OK
30/1/24, 6:14 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: So do you fullfil this ?
30/1/24, 6:53 PM - +263 71 800 1668: No

*“It is impossible for a man to learn what he thinks he already knows.”*

With positive energy, let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education. So shall we begin ?
31/1/24, 10:26 AM - +263 71 800 1668: Good morning.How are you?
31/1/24, 11:51 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I am fine thank you
31/1/24, 11:51 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats, however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge.  Having Conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.
31/1/24, 11:52 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 11:52 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 11:52 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 11:52 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I am shocked to compile these data for Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities of Zimbabwe.

Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE) -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - ($680 per term)

Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT) https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - ($535 per term)

University of Zimbabwe (UZ) -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm ($523 per term)

NUST -($870 per term)

I'm sure you and your family have discussed this thoroughly. What decisions have you made for your future? Considering the cost and employment opportunities, have you compared the benefits of studying in India with the Edoofa program against other options?
31/1/24, 12:31 PM - +263 71 800 1668: When comparing the fees structures it seems like it's cheaper in Zimbabwe since the budget for Indian fees structures is about 2000 to 3000 per year. However there are a wide range of opportunities from studying in india as we look upon opportunities for connectivity for mentorship, learning with people from different backgrounds and student seminars.
 We can say it may be expensive but has a variety of advantages thus the risk is worth it.
31/1/24, 2:13 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Thats means $600*2 semester $1200 per year for tution fees $200 per year for internship 

$70 a month rent * 12 months = $840 a year for accommodation

Basic 3 meal sadza a day $1 per meal *3 meals a day *365 days = $1095 

Data bundles - $ 50 a month right * 12 months = $600 

Misc- $300 

Total at UZ = Exceeds $4100

Have you calculated this ?
31/1/24, 2:13 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Where as at Edoofa at top universities abroad you are only paying $2000-$3000 also complementary you are getting EWYL program to self finance the fees so which one is affordable ?
31/1/24, 2:20 PM - +263 71 800 1668: Well it is affordable with Edoofa.
31/1/24, 2:22 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: That is the reason why we are preferred by every family in Africa.
31/1/24, 2:22 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Being a senior academic and counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.


*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
31/1/24, 2:25 PM - +263 71 800 1668: Everyone may not achieve success if they are not hardworking and do not have the necessary things to achieve greatness.
1/2/24, 8:58 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning!
I hope you're well. I sincerely apologize for the delay yesterday; I was engaged in a meeting. Thank you for your patience. As we resume our discussion, I'm reminded of Proverbs 16:3 (NIV): *"Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and he will establish your plans."* Shall we proceed with our decision now?
1/2/24, 9:04 AM - +263 71 800 1668: Yes. Good morning.
1/2/24, 10:25 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
1/2/24, 10:25 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: It is important to know why the Edoofa guidance will be unique compared to the normal University approach.
1/2/24, 10:25 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
1/2/24, 10:26 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
1/2/24, 10:26 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Financial Support and Planning:* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

1/2/24, 10:27 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
1/2/24, 10:27 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: These are just a few of the various benefits and keeping all this in mind, are you ready to step into your higher education through the Edoofa Program which is the most popular scholarship in Africa?
1/2/24, 12:43 PM - +263 71 800 1668: Yes if it is possible.
1/2/24, 2:40 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Computer Science) and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
1/2/24, 2:59 PM - +263 71 800 1668: Yes it's correct.
1/2/24, 3:22 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
1/2/24, 3:49 PM - +263 71 800 1668: I'm sorry that l still remember a few things. We discussed about the offer letter, that if l am found eligible l will receive an offer letter from a university but l have forgotten what happens if l do not receive because maybe their cutoff of points does not align with my points. Just like now, I'm certain it's hard to get *Computer Science* course in our best universities in Zimbabwe so l was thinking that you could help know. Since information technology is less complicated than computer science, although they cover almost the same things, will l be able even to get a diploma then tackle the bigger dream with time.
You also said the registration fee was $500.
1/2/24, 4:15 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 
Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000 

This means this registration fee that you pay will be subtracted from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.

*Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
1/2/24, 4:29 PM - +263 71 800 1668: No
1/2/24, 4:42 PM - +263 71 800 1668: I last paid 200 for enrollment fee, the balance was 150 then you told me to do EWYL then come back to you after the 2023 students had gone to India. You had told me about  the fees structures.

Let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education
5/2/24, 7:20 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Embrace education as the key to a brighter future. Proverbs 4:7 (NIV) wisely states, "The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom." Seize the opportunity to break free from limitations. Keep in mind Philippians 4:13 (NIV), "I can do all this through him who gives me strength." Let education empower your child!*

Over the past few days, we've been trying to connect with you to discuss your child's academic journey. We understand the financial commitments involved in providing quality education for your child.

As India seeks wisdom, let us prioritize education, creating a future where knowledge transcends boundaries and resonates more profoundly than ever.

On this note, let us conclude our conversation for today. I will reach out to you once we get an update from the universities. Wish you a blessed day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family as well.
