16/1/24, 11:25 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Subilo,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 11:25 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 2:09 PM - +260 96 5393861: Thanks a lot for this communique and grateful to God for this new year. Message well received and would like to state that the final results are yet to come out we are hoping the last week of January and we will get in touch and share immediately. Kind regards
16/1/24, 2:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome and thank you for letting me know that. It is alright please, once you receive your please share the same with us.

24/1/24, 9:27 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Recalling our counseling and evaluation sessions, I take pride in your qualification for our esteemed Edoofa Scholarship Program. Recently, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
24/1/24, 9:41 AM - +260 96 5393861: Good morning Mr. Sahil, I hear you and appreciate the love you have to foster education to the teens and support. The evaluation was based on the mock results submitted and a scholarship of 50% was awarded. I hinted that the 50% scholarship would be costly to us and needed something higher to ensure afordability. So we suggested that we wait for the final results for the girl so that we try another assessment if we can score a 100% or better so than we have confidence when sending the child abroad we'll have no pressure.
24/1/24, 9:41 AM - +260 96 5393861: Otherwise we already and eager to enroll in this edoofa program.
24/1/24, 10:35 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: By when are you expecting your results?

30/1/24, 12:04 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Medical Laboratory Technology (MLT) is closely related to medicine and plays a crucial role in the field of healthcare. MLT professionals are responsible for performing laboratory tests that aid in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases. Their work contributes valuable information that helps physicians make informed decisions about a patient's health.

Here's how MLT is related to medicine and the career options it opens up in hospitals:

Diagnostic Support: MLT professionals work with various medical specimens such as blood, urine, and tissues to conduct laboratory tests. The results of these tests provide critical information to physicians for diagnosing illnesses and determining appropriate treatment plans.

Pathology Services: In hospitals, MLT professionals are often part of the pathology department. They analyze samples to identify abnormalities, infections, or other health issues. This information is fundamental for understanding the nature of diseases.

Blood Banking: MLT experts are involved in blood banking, ensuring the safety and compatibility of blood transfusions. They perform tests to identify blood types, screen for infectious diseases, and ensure the quality of donated blood.

Microbiology and Virology: MLT professionals work in microbiology and virology laboratories, where they study microorganisms and viruses. This is crucial for identifying infectious diseases and implementing appropriate control measures.

Clinical Research: MLT experts may also contribute to clinical research by conducting experiments, analyzing data, and assisting in the development of new diagnostic techniques and treatments.

Quality Control: Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of laboratory tests is vital. MLT professionals may be involved in quality control processes to maintain high standards in laboratory testing.

Hospital Administration: MLT professionals may take on administrative roles in hospital laboratories, overseeing laboratory operations, managing staff, and ensuring compliance with regulations.

In summary, a career in MLT not only supports the medical field by providing essential diagnostic information but also opens up various opportunities within hospitals, research institutions, and healthcare settings.
30/1/24, 12:05 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: A *B.Sc. in Medical Laboratory Technology* is a 3-year undergraduate program that focuses on the skills and knowledge required to work in the field of clinical laboratory science.
