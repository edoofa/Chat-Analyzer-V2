22/1/24, 12:41 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 12:41 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 12:41 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Recalling our counseling and evaluation sessions, I take pride in your qualification for our esteemed Edoofa Scholarship Program. Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
22/1/24, 1:09 PM - +263 71 324 6917: Well, l remember you
22/1/24, 1:19 PM - +263 71 324 6917: Yes, " A" level results are out
 My big brother was supposed to make payment inorder for to complete the University registration process. I have a discussion with him  and he said he did not receive his salary. Thus the reason why l did not complete the university registration process.
22/1/24, 3:38 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Now that the results are out, and considering the limited availability of scholarships with seats filling up quickly, is your family prepared to cover your registration fees?
23/1/24, 7:08 AM - +263 71 300 4819: On behalf of Tawanda,I as an entrusted close relative to him, his wish is my command. Our common handicap here in Zimbabwe is an unstable economic environment! It's very unfortunate that a big proportion of our population cannot reliably plan for the next project or program. Setting goals is just a matter of gambling! If wishes were horses,then Tawanda would have been already registered, considering his passion  for learning and his ability to set up important and strategic goals for his life. It will not only help him to lift up his standard of life but all of us,in the sense that he will represent a lofty standard for everyone to emulate! We insist that your efforts to encourage him to continue persuing such supreme achievements should be given up. On our side as a family everyone is trying by all means possible to avail whatever little we may be able to get,each of us playing his/her own part to have Tawanda back on track. We thank you in advance for your continued support of lifting up aspiring generations especially the underprivileged,to stand a common ground with the well to do,the world over! On behalf of Tawanda Murwira's Family,Iam yours sincerely Morgen Chambwera!
23/1/24, 7:09 AM - +263 71 300 4819: @not be given up!

23/1/24, 4:03 PM - +263 71 300 4819: So far there isn't a single thing that we have done so far!
23/1/24, 4:20 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Can you elaborate ?
