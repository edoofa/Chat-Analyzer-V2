16/1/24, 11:52 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Proud Edoofians,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level/ grade 12 results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 11:52 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level/ grade 12 results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level/ grade 12 results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

24/1/24, 9:23 AM - Harmehak Edoofa: Good Day @27822269670 @27697854566 @27655583577, 

I am *Ms.Harmehak,Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction, I remembered that during our session you portrayed an enormous potential of becoming a leader of tomorrow. Hence I have asked my Colleague *Mr.Sahil, Senior Academician* @919821838532 to personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority. 

Hence I request you to come online and continue with your admission procedures.
24/1/24, 9:23 AM - +27 69 785 4566: Good morning
24/1/24, 10:34 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning 
How are you Samkele ?
24/1/24, 10:35 AM - +27 69 785 4566: I'm good how are you
24/1/24, 12:53 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good Day , 
*I am Mr Sahil*

Recalling your evaluation sessions, I take pride in your qualification for our esteemed Edoofa Scholarship Program. Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now? <This message was edited>
24/1/24, 1:42 PM - +27 69 785 4566: I couldn't afford registration fee and I'm planning on applying locally for university
24/1/24, 1:52 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Did you know that EDOOFA received an astounding 2000 scholarship applications in a single day recently, and the trend continues with no less than 1000 applications coming weekly? The surge prompted us to explore the reasons behind this unprecedented influx. Conversations with our current students, who are preparing to embark on their educational journey to India under the Edoofa Scholarship, revealed some astonishing screenshots from the fee prospectuses of universities in Zimbabwe.

24/1/24, 1:53 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I am shocked to compile these data for Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities of Zimbabwe.

Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE) -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - ($680 per term)

Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT) https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - ($535 per term)

University of Zimbabwe (UZ) -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm ($523 per term)

NUST -($870 per term)

I'm sure you and your family have discussed this thoroughly. What decisions have you made for your future? Considering the cost and employment opportunities, have you compared the benefits of studying in India with the Edoofa program against other options?
24/1/24, 2:04 PM - +27 69 785 4566: I'm not a Zimbabwean I'm a South African
24/1/24, 2:07 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I was providing an example for illustration purposes. However, it's noteworthy that the general cost of universities in South Africa is typically higher, ranging from $900 to $1300 per term.
24/1/24, 2:12 PM - +27 69 785 4566: Yeah I'll apply for bursaries and NSFAS
24/1/24, 2:20 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Have you applied for any till now ?
24/1/24, 2:20 PM - +27 69 785 4566: Yes I did
24/1/24, 3:34 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: In which one please and did you get any response ?
24/1/24, 7:32 PM - +27 69 785 4566: No I'm waiting for a response why are you asking me all this
24/1/24, 8:25 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I am trying to help you .
24/1/24, 8:27 PM - +27 69 785 4566: I only applied NSFAS

29/1/24, 11:54 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Happy new year .
29/1/24, 11:57 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Being a senior academic and counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.


*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
29/1/24, 11:59 AM - +27 82 226 9670: I know you want best for Samkele but as I said last we can't afford to pay fees for her
29/1/24, 12:01 PM - +27 82 226 9670: She did very well in her exams passed with bachelour degree so pain full that we can't manage to take her to varsity
29/1/24, 12:53 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 12:53 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: It is important to know why the Edoofa guidance will be unique compared to the normal University approach.
29/1/24, 12:54 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: 1. *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
29/1/24, 12:54 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 12:54 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: 3. *Financial Support and Planning:* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

29/1/24, 8:02 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 8:37 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Good morning Everyone!*  let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*"As the scriptures teach, knowledge is a steadfast companion. A person enlightened by wisdom is held in high regard across all realms. The brilliance of education surpasses the allure of beauty and the vigor of youth."*

 With positive energy, let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education. So shall we begin ?
30/1/24, 6:53 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I was anticipating your response today but unfortunately, you were not available all day. I look forward to your active participation tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT time. I am eager for our interaction. As we embark on a new day, let's reflect on the wisdom from Proverbs 3:5-6 (NIV): *'Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.'*
31/1/24, 10:06 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Good morning Everyone!*

*“It is impossible for a man to learn what he thinks he already knows.”*

With positive energy, let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education. So shall we begin ?
1/2/24, 8:44 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good morning!
I trust you are doing well. I've observed that my messages have been read but not responded to. In moments of silence, I'm reminded of Psalm 37:7 (NIV): "Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him." Is everything alright?
1/2/24, 8:57 AM - +27 69 785 4566: Yes
1/2/24, 8:57 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Did you manage to go through this please?
1/2/24, 9:04 AM - +27 69 785 4566: There's no need cause I've went through this before and I told you I will no longer be studying in India due to financial problems what part of this do you not understand
1/2/24, 10:44 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: May I know what if as parents are you entirely dependent on NSFAS if things don't turn out well how are you planning to continue education of Samkele ?
1/2/24, 10:48 AM - +27 69 785 4566: I will take a gap year and apply for NSFAS next year I'm not dependent on it it's mandatory for me as a South African to get funding from NSFAS
1/2/24, 1:42 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I understand the reliance on NSFAS. However, considering the competitiveness in the job market, what if there are delays or challenges in obtaining funding from NSFAS? Waiting for their response could potentially result in wasting one or more years for Samkele. In the current job market scenario, employers often prefer candidates with continuous education and work experience. A gap year might negatively impact Samkele's career. Have you considered alternative plans or options to ensure a smoother and timely continuation of Samkele's education?
1/2/24, 2:17 PM - +27 82 226 9670: This all make point but what is the use to take Samkele far from us and she faces difficulties there who is going to look after her cause we are finicially broke can't afford to pay for University at first we thought Endofa is taking care of everythingas NSFAS does cause they food accommodation as well as fees
1/2/24, 3:06 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Are you available for a call
