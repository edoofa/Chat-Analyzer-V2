2/2/24, 2:22 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Kudzai!

I understand that circumstances led you to delay your higher education journey as of last year, after taking a significant step towards building your future through us and I am sure that you must have been in touch with our Admissions team to figure out the best available solutions for you. Since then, Edoofa has been on a journey of innovation, creating new opportunities for learning and growth for students like you!

While I was going through your conversation, It reminded me of how I started my education journey full of questions and aspirations, and therefore I wanted to check in and have a conversation about how you are doing currently. 
May I know how are you planning to move your journey ahead?🚀

16/2/24, 2:43 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

While we were having multiple conversations with our students in the past few days for the meet & greet event, we figured that there is a slight confusion in the invitation dates. Hence, I wanted to quickly reach out and ensure that the same is not the case with you.

- As per the invitation, you are supposed to attend the event along with your parents on 17th of February which is tomorrow. 
- If you are recommending any of your friends(Non Edoofians) along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for 18th of February(8am/1pm) or 19th  February(1pm). They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event.
16/2/24, 2:43 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Please ensure that you are present at the venue 30 minutes earlier and are dressed appropriately.
Don't forget to carry your admit card!

Cannot wait to see you there tomorrow! Hope you're excited too! 😃🕺🏻
16/2/24, 2:47 PM - +263 78 888 5077: Good day to you Ma'am
17/2/24, 7:44 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good morning!
I hope this message finds you full of excitement and energy as the most awaited day of the event is here! Make sure you reach the venue on time so that you can make the most of the huge opportunity that you have in front of you today.🚀

Also, do not forget to share your experience and pictures of the event, once things are wrapped up there. All the best and have a blast there!👍🏻😃
17/2/24, 1:43 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 

As our team engages with Edoofians and parents at today's meet & greet event in Harare, I couldn't help but notice your absence. We were truly looking forward to connecting with you and your family, and exploring the many growth opportunities that Edoofa offers.

Could you please share why you and your parents couldn't attend?
17/2/24, 8:43 PM - +263 78 888 5077: Good evening Maam! 

Maam my parents are not around so no one was able to provide transport fee and some refreshments for me . <This message was edited>
19/2/24, 9:36 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning Kudzai!
Hope you are well.

No need to apologize at all! I completely understand. Financial constraints can be challenging, and it's okay that you couldn't attend the meeting. Perhaps there will be opportunities in the future. I wish you could also be there and be a part of this amazing event, no worries though here is a picture of our Edoofians at the event do have a look at it.✨
19/2/24, 5:24 PM - +263 78 888 5077: Good day Ma'am 😊
19/2/24, 5:24 PM - +263 78 888 5077: I'm still waiting for the picture
