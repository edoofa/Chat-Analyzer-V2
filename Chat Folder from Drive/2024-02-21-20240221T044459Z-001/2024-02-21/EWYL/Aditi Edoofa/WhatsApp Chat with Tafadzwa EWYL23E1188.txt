23/1/24, 8:29 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning on this beautiful day!✨
Hope you are well.

Let's begin with today's session🚀
23/1/24, 8:34 AM - +263 78 378 6270: Morning to you too
23/1/24, 8:35 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
23/1/24, 8:35 AM - +263 78 378 6270: My sister's husband and my brother, my sisters are yet to join
23/1/24, 8:37 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I extend a warm welcome to you for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey
23/1/24, 8:40 AM - +263 78 378 6270: Thank you very much
23/1/24, 8:52 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So Tafadzwa, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
23/1/24, 9:07 AM - +263 78 378 6270: Being able to further my education going through university it is my biggest long term goal in that, If l am able to be granted the chance to get a place in a university. 
A university is going to make me have more knowledge about the course that l always dreamt of doing which is Psychology. It has always been one of my goals too so as l further my education through university will be able to be better and well educated in that course and all of my goals start through getting into university and acquiring knowledge about the course deeper. Also through out the journey want to be able to have a huge impact  in the society through I want to be able to finish my education and further it even more until l am a renowned psychologist that has started up organizations for those people in need of  care and time to be listened to especially the issues and problems they can not share with anyone. I want to be able to have campaigns against staying silent when one is mentally depressed. One person's health matters especially emotionally and mentally, people have to know about the dangers of depression and anxiety. After everything else want to have a positive impact in the society...these are my long term goals
23/1/24, 9:09 AM - +263 78 378 6270: The EWYL will help me in getting more skills be it interaction with other people since the course that l want focuses more on interaction too with people and will help in getting the scholarship credits that will make it easy for me to further my education since l will be having fees to pay that will be manageable and more family friendly....
23/1/24, 9:11 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Your long-term goals are truly inspiring, aiming not only for personal growth through education but also to make a meaningful impact on society, particularly in mental health awareness and support. Pursuing Psychology is a noble path, and your vision for starting organizations and campaigns against mental health challenges showcases your commitment to creating positive change.

It's great to hear that you see the Earn While You Learn program as a valuable resource for acquiring skills and earning scholarship credits. The program's focus on interaction and the flexibility it offers in managing fees align well with your aspirations.
23/1/24, 9:14 AM - +263 78 378 6270: Following
23/1/24, 9:14 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
23/1/24, 9:16 AM - +263 78 378 6270: Do not understand
23/1/24, 9:18 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
23/1/24, 9:18 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
23/1/24, 9:20 AM - +263 78 378 6270: Following
23/1/24, 9:22 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
23/1/24, 9:24 AM - +263 78 378 6270: Okay , noted
23/1/24, 9:24 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
23/1/24, 9:26 AM - +263 78 378 6270: Yes, very interesting
23/1/24, 9:29 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.
23/1/24, 9:29 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 9:29 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 9:35 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Wrapping up the session I must say it's been a wonderful interaction. I can't wait for our next one.
23/1/24, 9:39 AM - +263 78 378 6270: Same applies...and thank you very much
24/1/24, 8:28 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Happy Wednesday!🌻

24/1/24, 8:30 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
24/1/24, 8:30 AM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
24/1/24, 8:34 AM - +263 78 378 6270: It sounds interesting and great
24/1/24, 8:37 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
24/1/24, 8:37 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube

4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is.
24/1/24, 8:49 AM - +263 78 378 6270: 1. We have Ms Sanjana who is the Head of the EWYL department,  Ms Davi who is the Head coach of the EWYL and yes of course Ms Aditi who is my EWYL mentor...then my sister's husband and brother 

2. My mentor's 1st goal is make me have an equal opportunity to develop 21st century skills that will ensure me that l am equipped for the employment market after am done with my final degree
2nd goal that my mentor has for me is for me to be able to self-finance my very own education by working hard and making sure l earn maximum amount of credits

3.
24/1/24, 8:49 AM - +263 78 378 6270: 3. Newsletter
24/1/24, 8:50 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
24/1/24, 8:55 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now what about the 4th one? <This message was edited>
24/1/24, 8:55 AM - +263 78 378 6270: 4. Hall of inspiration in my very own understanding it's a room or space but in this scenario it's a group of people that have a certain program they do which is to give enthusiasm to people  or something that is going to give them new creative ideas and more insight regarding life in general and how to tackle certain problems in life
24/1/24, 8:56 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Awesome!
24/1/24, 8:56 AM - Aditi Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of.

25/1/24, 8:44 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing, I’m happy with your understanding.

25/1/24, 8:54 AM - +263 78 378 6270: The document is just explaining the steps on how to search for these companies that we will be needing to partner with as Edoofa program and the ways that are more precise and more clearer and easier to do in order to have a successful project.

25/1/24, 9:28 AM - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-

3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
25/1/24, 9:29 AM - +263 78 378 6270: Noted
25/1/24, 9:31 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
25/1/24, 9:31 AM - +263 78 378 6270: Following
25/1/24, 9:31 AM - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*TAFADZWA/ADITI*
25/1/24, 9:32 AM - +263 78 378 6270: Okay following
25/1/24, 9:32 AM - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
25/1/24, 9:32 AM - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
25/1/24, 9:32 AM - Aditi Edoofa: ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

Same applies

So are you ready for the session?🚀
29/1/24, 8:32 AM - +263 78 378 6270: Good morning to you 

Yes, am ready
29/1/24, 8:35 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
29/1/24, 8:37 AM - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
29/1/24, 8:37 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

The past three days flew by in a whirlwind for Team Edoofa – both for those in India and those in Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. Now that we've had a chance to catch our breath, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success.

Your insights from the event are highly valued, and I'm keen to hear about your experience. Would you be open to sharing your thoughts, including your interest in attending similar events in the future and any suggestions for improvement?

20/2/24, 6:35 PM - +263 78 378 6270: Personally the event, made me more confident with the Edoofa program and it's board members...unlike other reviews we have been getting we were not so sure if it was worth but after Mr Angad explained everything to us even sharing videos of other edofians already there in India , we can finally it's worth it. Everyone wanted this one on one meeting that's what l have realized and parents that attended now trust that Edoofa it's a real thing not a myth...l would definitely be glad to attend more of these events from yesterday onwards.
