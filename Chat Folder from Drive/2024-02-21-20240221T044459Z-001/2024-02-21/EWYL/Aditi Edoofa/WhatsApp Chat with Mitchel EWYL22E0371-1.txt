I have been expecting to hear from you for the past couple of days, but I can see you have not been able to get back to me due to certain reasons I am not aware of. You see, I was looking forward to having you at the event as I know how beneficial it is going to be for you. Most of my students have already quite enthusiastically reserved seats for themselves and their family and friends.

Is everything alright? Are you facing any challenges? Is there something you'd like to share?
