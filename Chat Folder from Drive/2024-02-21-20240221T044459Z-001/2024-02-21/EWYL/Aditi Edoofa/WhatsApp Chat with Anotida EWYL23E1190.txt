23/1/24, 8:35 AM - +263 71 445 2768: I’m doing good ma’am
23/1/24, 8:35 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Yes
23/1/24, 8:35 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
23/1/24, 8:35 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I can see that there is someone else who has joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
23/1/24, 8:36 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Ok ma’am
23/1/24, 8:36 AM - +263 71 445 2768: That’s Mr Zvavamwe my dad

23/1/24, 8:46 AM - +263 71 445 2768: You’re welcome
23/1/24, 8:48 AM - +263 77 256 4012: Hi How are you I'm Me Zvavamwe Anotida's Father
23/1/24, 8:49 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Nice to meet you Sir!
23/1/24, 8:50 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So Anotida, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
23/1/24, 8:58 AM - +263 71 445 2768: I want to finish my degree and become one of the best lawyers in my country I think ENWYL Will help me to achieve my dreams and also it will help me to have skills for instance time management like what you said being and Edoofian you have to be punctual
23/1/24, 9:01 AM - Aditi Edoofa: That's an excellent ambition! Completing your degree and aiming to become one of the best lawyers in your country is a remarkable goal. The EWYL program is indeed a valuable opportunity to not only support your academic journey but also equip you with essential skills, including time management. Punctuality is indeed crucial, and developing strong time management skills will serve you well in your studies and future endeavors.
23/1/24, 9:09 AM - +263 71 445 2768: That’s true ma’am
23/1/24, 9:09 AM - +263 71 445 2768: I’m sure this program will help me in the future
23/1/24, 9:12 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
23/1/24, 9:18 AM - +263 71 445 2768: No I don’t
23/1/24, 9:18 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
23/1/24, 9:18 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
23/1/24, 9:35 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Wrapping up the session I must say it's been a wonderful interaction. I can't wait for our next one.
23/1/24, 9:37 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Exciting news
23/1/24, 9:37 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Thank you
23/1/24, 9:37 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Ok ma’am thank you
24/1/24, 8:27 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Good morning ma’am
24/1/24, 8:28 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Happy Wednesday!🌻
Hope you are well.

Are you ready for today's session?
24/1/24, 8:30 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Yes I’m ready
24/1/24, 8:35 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
24/1/24, 8:36 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Thank you <This message was edited>
24/1/24, 8:37 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Nice to know
24/1/24, 8:38 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
24/1/24, 8:40 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Yea it’s interesting
24/1/24, 8:40 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.
24/1/24, 8:41 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 8:41 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 8:46 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Yes I’m done
24/1/24, 8:48 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
24/1/24, 8:49 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Yes it is
24/1/24, 8:49 AM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
24/1/24, 8:50 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Thank you
24/1/24, 8:50 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Sounds great
24/1/24, 8:51 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
24/1/24, 8:52 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube

4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is.
24/1/24, 9:02 AM - +263 71 445 2768: 1. We have Ms Sanjana the Head of the department and Ms Davi the head coach 

They will monitoring our group conversations and the mentoring us through their structured curriculum 

2 my mentor has set 3 goals for me which are 
 
Making sure that my academic journey is great 

Making sure that I am given enough opportunities to self finance my education in India 

Working towards attaining the objective of 21st century skills

3 Newsletter 

4 the hall of inspiration is there to inspire young people in many ways for instance in one the newsletters it is there to advise people that being mature is not a matter of age but one has to grow mentally so that he or she may be successful in life and also when one is mature it is easy for them to learn life skill.
24/1/24, 9:03 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Awesome!!
24/1/24, 9:03 AM - Aditi Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
24/1/24, 9:04 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 9:04 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Ok ma’am
24/1/24, 9:10 AM - Aditi Edoofa: @263714452768 Have you gone through it?
24/1/24, 9:10 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Yes I’m done
24/1/24, 9:10 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Quite interesting
24/1/24, 9:11 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, that’s wonderful. I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
24/1/24, 9:15 AM - +263 71 445 2768: My understanding with the document is there are different projects in the Edoofa EWYL Program where an Edoofian has to take part of . After the competition of wacho project one is supposed to get scholarship credits which are directed to the fees balance for example visiting local secondary schools and tell young students about the program is also another task that will help a student to get credits so basically the EWYL Program is there to equip young people with 21st century life skill.
24/1/24, 9:16 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing, I’m happy with your understanding.
24/1/24, 9:19 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Thank you
24/1/24, 9:22 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
24/1/24, 9:22 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

24/1/24, 9:29 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
24/1/24, 9:31 AM - +263 71 445 2768: One has to identify different companies within his/ her country and shared objectives on how the edoofa program is helping people to get different life skills after graduating in India
24/1/24, 9:32 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great! 
So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!

These companies are supposed to be financially sound so that they will be able to take care of the Edoofians through their journey

What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship?

I have learnt that Edoofa is helping young people to acquire good education facility in India
Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)?
I want good education facility which is not there in my country and some of the degrees that are offered in my country are internationally recognized.
29/1/24, 9:12 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Superb!
29/1/24, 9:12 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
29/1/24, 9:12 AM - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*ANOTIDA/ADITI*
29/1/24, 9:13 AM - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
29/1/24, 9:13 AM - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
29/1/24, 9:13 AM - Aditi Edoofa: ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:

29/1/24, 9:16 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Exciting
29/1/24, 9:16 AM - +263 71 445 2768: So I’m supposed to visit schools in my Area?
29/1/24, 9:18 AM - Aditi Edoofa: You can if you want to.
29/1/24, 9:18 AM - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
29/1/24, 9:18 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

30/1/24, 9:28 AM - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

While we were having multiple conversations with our students in the past few days for the meet & greet event, we figured that there is a slight confusion in the invitation dates. Hence, I wanted to quickly reach out and ensure that the same is not the case with you.

- As per the invitation, *you* are supposed to attend the event along with your parents on *19th of February* which is Monday.
 
- If you are recommending any of *your friends (Non Edoofians)* along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for *18th of February (8am/1pm) or 19th February(1pm)*. They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event.
17/2/24, 9:03 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Please ensure that you are present at the venue 30 minutes earlier and are dressed appropriately.
Don't forget to carry your admit card!
