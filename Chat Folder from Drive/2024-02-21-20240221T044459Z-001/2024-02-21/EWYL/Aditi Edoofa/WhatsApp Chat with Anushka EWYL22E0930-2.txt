2/2/24, 1:53 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello, Anushka, this is an official announcement from Team Edoofa!

*Great news – there's a reserved spot just for you in the registration process!* 
We understand that sometimes deadlines can be challenging to meet. Missing the registration fee deadline might seem like a roadblock, however, it isn't yet! Your dedication matters the most to us.

I am sure that your admissions officers must have already taken the first steps, and as a mentor, it is my advice to you to have transparency in your conversations so that we can help you fulfill your goal of arriving in India for your higher education! ✅
There’s a catch! You now have a chance to fast-track your admissions process and meet your officers too! 😀

*Join our unique event in Harare with 5000+ participants for a meet & greet, Q&A, and fast-track admission to your journey to India.* Bring your parents for a deeper understanding of the program. Secure your seats by confirming the number of attendees. Excited to have you! ✨
7/2/24, 11:28 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello, Anushka!

I have been expecting to hear from you for the past couple of days, but I can see you have not been able to get back to me due to certain reasons I am not aware of. You see, I was looking forward to having you at the event as I know how beneficial it is going to be for you. Most of my students have already quite enthusiastically reserved seats for themselves and their family and friends.

Is everything alright? Are you facing any challenges? Is there something you'd like to share?
