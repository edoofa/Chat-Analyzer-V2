17/2/24, 9:33 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning, Trevor!

While we were having multiple conversations with our students in the past few days for the meet & greet event, we figured that there is a slight confusion in the invitation dates. Hence, I wanted to quickly reach out and ensure that the same is not the case with you.

- As per the invitation, *you* are supposed to attend the event along with your parents on *19th of February* which is Monday.
 
- If you are recommending any of *your friends (Non Edoofians)* along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for *18th of February (8am/1pm) or 19th February(1pm)*. They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event.
17/2/24, 9:33 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Please ensure that you are present at the venue 30 minutes earlier and are dressed appropriately.
Don't forget to carry your admit card!

Cannot wait to see you there tomorrow! Hope you're excited too! 😃🕺🏻
17/2/24, 10:36 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Just a Correction, we will see you there on Monday, *19th February 2024*.
18/2/24, 10:33 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning Trevor!

We are ready to make your weekend extra special and worthwhile!  We do realize we've been reaching out to you a bit more frequently than usual 😃, but the wait is finally over, and we're bursting with excitement to meet you at the meet & greet event tomorrow!🕺🏻

While we make the necessary arrangements for you and your parents at the venue, could you please let us know who along with you is attending the event?
