I understand that circumstances led you to delay your higher education journey as of last year, after taking a significant step towards building your future through us and I am sure that you must have been in touch with our Admissions team to figure out the best available solutions for you. Since then, Edoofa has been on a journey of innovation, creating new opportunities for learning and growth for students like you!

While I was going through your conversation, It reminded me of how I started my education journey full of questions and aspirations, and therefore I wanted to check in and have a conversation about how you are doing currently. 
May I know how are you planning to move your journey ahead?🚀

The past three days flew by in a whirlwind for Team Edoofa – both for those in India and those in Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. Now that we've had a chance to catch our breath, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success.

Your insights from the event are highly valued, and I'm keen to hear about your experience. Would you be open to sharing your thoughts, including your interest in attending similar events in the future and any suggestions for improvement? Additionally, if you have captured any memorable moments in photos, we would greatly appreciate you sharing them.

Your perspective is crucial, and I also encourage you to discuss the event with your parents and gather their feedback.
