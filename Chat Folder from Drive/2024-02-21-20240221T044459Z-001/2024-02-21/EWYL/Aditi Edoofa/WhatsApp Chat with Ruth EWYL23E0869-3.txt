6/1/24, 1:25 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of *our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs*, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:26 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
6/1/24, 1:38 PM - +263 78 616 4869: Oooh ok ok
6/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 78 616 4869: Great
11/1/24, 4:09 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hellooooo!!!!

I quickly just wanted to share the scoop on *Slice Con'24—it was seriously awesome!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️

17/2/24, 9:01 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning Ruth!

While we were having multiple conversations with our students in the past few days for the meet & greet event, we figured that there is a slight confusion in the invitation dates. Hence, I wanted to quickly reach out and ensure that the same is not the case with you.

- As per the invitation, *you* are supposed to attend the event along with your parents on *19th of February* which is Monday.
 
- If you are recommending any of *your friends (Non Edoofians)* along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for *18th of February (8am/1pm) or 19th February(1pm)*. They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event.
17/2/24, 9:01 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Please ensure that you are present at the venue 30 minutes earlier and are dressed appropriately.
Don't forget to carry your admit card!

Cannot wait to see you there tomorrow! Hope you're excited too! 😃🕺🏻
17/2/24, 9:42 AM - +263 77 750 3842: Good morning. I am sorry to announce our failure to attend the much awaited function. This has been brought in because we only managed to secure an examination seating for June end of day yesterday. We hoped to have secured it in our province , Masvingo , earlier but could not get it as most centers are not affording June exams and some not welcoming external students. We are yet to receive the statement of entry for the exam early next week. Ruth and I would want to apologize for the inconveniences caused.  I believe you know that Ruth needs A level Chemistry for her to qualify for the offered University degree program. Thank you for understanding .
17/2/24, 10:12 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Just a Correction, we will see you there on Monday, *19th February 2024*.
17/2/24, 10:12 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, please I do understand that, however I would advise you to attend the event, and the admissions as well as counseling team there will be helping you with this.
18/2/24, 10:13 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning Ruth!

We are ready to make your weekend extra special and worthwhile!  We do realize we've been reaching out to you a bit more frequently than usual 😃, but the wait is finally over, and we're bursting with excitement to meet you at the meet & greet event tomorrow!🕺🏻

While we make the necessary arrangements for you and your parents at the venue, could you please let us know who along with you is attending the event?
18/2/24, 10:13 AM - Aditi Edoofa: In the meanwhile, I am sharing a few pictures & clips of yesterday's seminar with you. Take a look!
