Hope you are well.

Over the past few days, I've noticed that network challenges may be limiting your ability to participate in our sessions. However, for quite some time now, I've observed that our progress in these sessions has been stagnant due to your unavailability. Could you please clarify if there are any factors beyond network issues that are hindering your attendance in these sessions?

We understand that sometimes deadlines can be challenging to meet. Missing the registration fee deadline might seem like a roadblock, however, it isn't yet! Your dedication matters the most to us.

I am sure that your admissions officers must have already taken the first steps, and as a mentor, it is my advice to you to have transparency in your conversations so that we can help you fulfill your goal of arriving in India for your higher education! ✅
There’s a catch! You now have a chance to fast-track your admissions process and meet your officers too! 😀

*Join our unique event in Harare with 5000+ participants for a meet & greet, Q&A, and fast-track admission to your journey to India.* Bring your parents for a deeper understanding of the program. Secure your seats by confirming the number of attendees. Excited to have you! ✨ <This message was edited>

• To get the admit card, make sure you have filled out the form mentioned below.
• ONLY you have to fill out the form, your guardian or your parent do not have to fill out the form.

(This form will ask you for a *UNIQUE PASSCODE*, which is :) - *E0363*

I hope you are doing well! It was noticed that we are not able to generate the admit card for you due to wrong passcode. 

This is your new passcode:

You can fill the registartion form again and let us know about the same. We will provide you with the admit card. <This message was edited>

I hope you are doing well. 

Since you have not received your admit card, as you improperly filled the registartion form, you can directly reach the venue and you will be registered on the venue itself.
