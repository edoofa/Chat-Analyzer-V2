12/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 71 696 6271: Thank you
12/1/24, 1:38 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So Kudakwashe, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
12/1/24, 1:51 PM - +263 77 650 5799: My long term goal is doing a masters in my program which is medical laboratory technology I want to open my personal research institute and laboratory in Zimbabwe so that I can establish medical base and do research on medicine and mass produce medicine also built pharmacies which will sell the medicine this way I will end the problem of shortage of medicine and expensive medicine in my country
12/1/24, 1:53 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your ambitious and impactful long-term goal. Pursuing a Master's in Medical Laboratory Technology and establishing your own research institute and laboratory in Zimbabwe reflects a commendable vision. Your plan to conduct research on medicine, mass produce it, and open pharmacies to address the shortage and affordability issues is both noble and essential. Such initiatives have the potential to significantly contribute to the healthcare sector in your country, improving accessibility to essential medicines.
12/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Yeah that's my main goal
12/1/24, 1:55 PM - +263 77 650 5799: I have seen and heard a lot of people die due to shortage and poor medication so I wanna change that
12/1/24, 1:57 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
12/1/24, 1:58 PM - Aditi Edoofa: That's such an amazing thought!
12/1/24, 1:58 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Please explain
12/1/24, 1:59 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
12/1/24, 1:59 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
12/1/24, 2:01 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Noted mam
12/1/24, 2:03 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
12/1/24, 2:04 PM - +263 77 650 5799: It's a pleasure knowing them 🙂
12/1/24, 2:05 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Awesome!
12/1/24, 2:05 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
12/1/24, 2:13 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Yes it's interesting
12/1/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.
12/1/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/1/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/1/24, 2:34 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Wow this is so inspiring I look forward to receiving more newsletters in the future
12/1/24, 2:34 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
12/1/24, 2:34 PM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
12/1/24, 2:34 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Yes indeed it's great
12/1/24, 2:34 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Today's session concludes here.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
20/1/24, 2:07 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
20/1/24, 2:07 PM - Aditi Edoofa: ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

20/1/24, 2:09 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Oky let me create one
20/1/24, 2:09 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Noted
20/1/24, 2:10 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
20/1/24, 2:10 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

22/1/24, 2:11 PM - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

23/1/24, 2:22 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, sure!
23/1/24, 2:22 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Wow! You look lovely!❤️
23/1/24, 2:23 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Thank you mam ☺️
23/1/24, 2:24 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
23/1/24, 2:25 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Oky mam did you get e form I sent you

23/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Thank you mam
23/1/24, 2:36 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Wrapping up the session I must say it's been a wonderful interaction.
24/1/24, 1:37 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Happy Wednesday!🌻
Hope you are well.

Are you ready for today's session?
24/1/24, 1:40 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Yeah let's start
24/1/24, 1:44 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
24/1/24, 1:44 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that you will be having. I would like to brief you about the roles of your Counselor, your Admission Officer, and your EWYL Mentor.
24/1/24, 1:44 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Oky mam
24/1/24, 2:17 PM - +263 77 650 5799: This message was deleted
24/1/24, 2:17 PM - Aditi Edoofa: @263776505799 May I know what are you referring to?
24/1/24, 2:18 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Sorry wrong message
24/1/24, 2:25 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Alright!
24/1/24, 2:25 PM - Aditi Edoofa: During your journey with Edoofa, you majorly go through 3 stages! Do you have any idea what might be the three stages?

Your *counselor* is your _first point of contact_. Your counselor has been guiding you during your _onboarding process_ where you learned about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same.
24/1/24, 2:25 PM - Aditi Edoofa: After that, you are contacted by your _Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with your admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all your admissions-related queries like your _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._
24/1/24, 2:28 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Noted mam
24/1/24, 2:31 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Finally, you will be starting your _EWYL journey with your EWYL Mentor,_ where you get a chance to learn *21st-century job skills* and *earn scholarship credits* which will ultimately help you fund your higher education. Your Mentor will be involved with you at every step and will be guiding your way throughout your journey. Your mentor will be your closest point of contact who will help you build your personality along with your skill set. All your queries related to your EWYL program will be addressed by your mentor.
24/1/24, 2:31 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Note: Your EWYL mentor will not be addressing your admission queries
24/1/24, 2:31 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries
24/1/24, 2:32 PM - +263 77 650 5799: We are on the same page mam
24/1/24, 2:36 PM - Aditi Edoofa: That concludes our initial orientation. I trust that you've gained valuable insights and anticipate that there will be more to come as we progress towards achieving great success.
24/1/24, 2:36 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Yes indeed I have
24/1/24, 2:39 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
25/1/24, 1:09 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *_🌟 URGENT UPDATE 🌟_*

Kudakwashe, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

In light of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. *We won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable* and I am confident that together, we will create something truly extraordinary.
25/1/24, 4:18 PM - Aditi Edoofa: As India celebrates its Republic Day, I would like to inform you that tomorrow, 26th January,24,🇮🇳 is a national holiday in honor of this significant occasion.  In observance of this special day, our institution will be closed tomorrow, and there will be no official activities.
Let us take this time to reflect on the values and principles that our constitution upholds, promoting unity, diversity, and freedom for all citizens. Enjoy the holiday with your loved ones, and let the spirit of patriotism resonate within our hearts. ❤️

2/2/24, 1:39 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Kudakwashe, As the countdown to your India journey ticks away, with just a quarter left (approximately 3 to  4 months! 😀) before you step into this new adventure, I understand that the chaos and preparations might be swirling around you. Let's navigate through this excitement together. Here is an amazing opportunity for you as *our Founder & CEO Mr. Angad, along with the admission officers and counselors (whom you have only met virtually until now) are coming to Zimbabwe for an exclusive annual meet & greet! Sounds amazing, right?* 🤩

With more than 5000 people participating, this meet & greet is going to be truly unique that Harare has ever seen. We present to you a fantastic opportunity for you to ask questions, address your concerns/queries, fast-track your admission process, and gain clarity about your journey to India.🇮🇳
2/2/24, 1:40 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I strongly advise bringing your parents and guardians; they play a vital role in your life journey and education decisions. As you're on the verge of starting your higher education, this event allows them to actively participate, understand the program, and witness the experiences of your senior Edoofians.

Prepare for this adventure! I'm genuinely thrilled that you'll be part of this phenomenal event!✨
To secure your seats, kindly let us know how many seats shall be reserved for you.
7/2/24, 11:25 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello, Kudakwashe!

I have been expecting to hear from you for the past couple of days, but I can see you have not been able to get back to me due to certain reasons I am not aware of. You see, I was looking forward to having you at the event as I know how beneficial it is going to be for you. Most of my students have already quite enthusiastically reserved seats for themselves and their family and friends.

Is everything alright? Are you facing any challenges? Is there something you'd like to share?
7/2/24, 2:52 PM - +263 77 650 5799: How are u mam I would really love to come to the event but I stay far away from Harare and my family can't afford to come for the event as transportation fee and food exceeds our budget
7/2/24, 3:04 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Well, as your mentor I truly appreciate your commitment and effort to attend the event. We understand that travel logistics can sometimes be challenging, and we want to make attending our event as convenient as possible for you but making travel arrangements at such a scale is not possible for us. So, you would be required to make your travel arrangements by yourself. 

However, I want to emphasize that this event is not just a gathering; it's an investment toward your future education. Our founders, who have traveled all the way from India, covering a distance of over 5000 miles, are coming specifically to meet you and share insights about your higher education and numerous opportunities.

So, as your mentor, I would strongly suggest that you make the necessary arrangements and attend the event as it’s going to be a life-changing experience for you.
7/2/24, 3:57 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Kudakwashe, I also wanted to reach out to you today because I have been studying your progress in the EWYL Community Building Project and seeing that you shared less than even 5 referrals this month it's clear that you're putting in efforts. Kudos to you for that!💯
So today, I'm stepping in to assist you. If you're facing any challenges in your projects or if there are concerns you'd like to address, feel free to share them with me. Your success is our priority, and I'm here to support you every step of the way.✨

Remember your progress and development are our top priorities. Let's continue this journey together. Keep up the spirit and hard work, I am really proud of you!❤️
7/2/24, 8:46 PM - +263 77 650 5799: As of now I'm kinda facing challenges creating my LinkedIn account
7/2/24, 8:56 PM - +263 77 650 5799: I understand will try to be there but I can't promise

Hope you are well.
