22/1/24, 4:29 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *_🌟 URGENT UPDATE 🌟_*

Bright, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it's going to be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes proper time and effort, our team will be occupied so tight. Therefore, I was thinking of connecting only once a week for the time being.

Therefore, your new session timing will be *Every Tuesday, 9:30 a.m*. ⏰

Can't wait for this adventure together! 🚀

- If you are recommending any of *your friends (Non Edoofians)* along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for *18th of February (8am/1pm) or 19th February(1pm)*. They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event.
17/2/24, 8:53 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Please ensure that you are present at the venue 30 minutes earlier and are dressed appropriately.
