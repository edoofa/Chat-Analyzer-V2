6/2/24, 9:20 AM - +263 78 101 2373: Thank you for further elaborating and making me understand better☺️

6/2/24, 9:24 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Sure,  Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
6/2/24, 9:24 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
6/2/24, 9:27 AM - +263 78 101 2373: It's grate you are preparing students for the future
6/2/24, 9:28 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Indeed, Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
6/2/24, 9:28 AM - +263 78 101 2373: I really appreciate the explanation regarding the goals of the EWYL PROGRAM...
6/2/24, 9:29 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!

7/2/24, 8:45 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
7/2/24, 8:48 AM - +263 78 101 2373: Right
7/2/24, 8:49 AM - +263 78 101 2373: Am still trying to understand the program structure and l hope l learn more as we move forward
7/2/24, 8:57 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

7/2/24, 9:10 AM - +263 78 101 2373: It's really great and l appreciate his efforts
7/2/24, 9:16 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Indeed!

Basing on my understanding ,l learned about the Corporate Alliance, Community building and also the African Schools Education Reform Mission.So the Corporate Alliance covers the issue where Edoofians have to form a joint professional network with different companies thereby making Edoofa Program known to many companies in the World.Edoofians get to share the whole foundation about Edoofa including it's mission and the work.
Community building is a project whereby students get to tell other students about Edoofa Program,making them realize their dreams through Edoofa and enrolling them into the beneficial system of accessible and affordable education.

African Schools Education Reform Mission entails about the movement of Edoofians into the Local Schools to make Edoofa known to Senior Secondary Schools so that they collaborate with Edoofa.


All these projects are there to shape Edoofians communication skills, confidence and also the attitude of not giving up.

12/2/24, 9:21 AM - +263 78 101 2373: The guide for searching companies illustrates and gives the correct guidance on how to approach the companies for an Alliance.The factors to consider are finding more about the nature of the company that is it can be of student based, recreational and content based.There are a few examples given there for complete understanding.

The second factor is the scale of the company that is the company should not be too small or too big but one that is average keeping in mind the employee size.Financial stability is also considered....that implies to the companie's financial stability.Checking the background of the founder could be of help so that one learns about the experiences , qualifications and accomplishments.

So this Admit Card is it only for the examination and not for the Meet and Greet??
17/2/24, 9:28 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings Miracle
I am doing fine, thank you!

Miracle, it is required for both examination and meet and greet
17/2/24, 9:28 AM - Aditi Edoofa: While we were having multiple conversations with our students in the past few days for the meet & greet event, we figured that there is a slight confusion in the invitation dates. Hence, I wanted to quickly reach out and ensure that the same is not the case with you.

- As per the invitation, *you* are supposed to attend the event along with your parents on *19th of February* which is Monday.
 
- If you are recommending any of *your friends (Non Edoofians)* along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for *18th of February (8am/1pm) or 19th February(1pm)*. They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event. <This message was edited>

20/2/24, 3:04 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Miracle!

The past three days flew by in a whirlwind for Team Edoofa – both for those in India and those in Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. Now that we've had a chance to catch our breath, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success.

Your insights from the event are highly valued, and I'm keen to hear about your experience. Would you be open to sharing your thoughts, including your interest in attending similar events in the future and any suggestions for improvement? Additionally, if you have captured any memorable moments in photos, we would greatly appreciate you sharing them.

Your perspective is crucial, and I also encourage you to discuss the event with your parents and gather their feedback.
20/2/24, 7:46 PM - +263 78 101 2373: Hi beloved Mentor hope everything is good there.Its such a pleasure connecting with you again.



For me it was not just an event but a well organised program for me and others to learn more about Edoofa,interacting with other fellow students and of course getting a deeper connection with Team Edoofa from India.Personally ,l have never attended such an occasion that is full of aspiration, motivation and information filled.


I got the chance to write the ESAT on Sunday morning along with other students.It was an unexpected thing that l could meet one of my friends from my former school ( Marange High). Furthermore,a one on one session was held and since l attended the event with my mom and aunt we did partake in it.The leader of the session was Mr Piysh.He was so informative and attended each and every parent's issues.Under his reference,we had a discussion with Ms Vilsha and she was the one who gave all the information regarding my offer letter.


Monday: Meet and Greet Day

I don't wanna lie but this was a different day.I was shocked and amazed at the same time.Sunday was different from Monday 💯.The Hall was filled to the brim.Everything was perfect and up to standard due to the Edoofa Team hardwork.In a nutshell,Ms Vilsha was checking the students admit card and Mr Piysh was instructing other things for better cause so that the event becomes a success.
20/2/24, 7:46 PM - +263 78 101 2373: Mr Angad,the founder gave his opening remarks and shared a lot of information.We watched some videos for instance one was about the Slice Con event and the other was show casting how the Proud Edoofian family are living there.(my seniors)
 
It is true that we as humans believe when we see.Doubts were cleared and l can strongly say a lot of parents doubts were cleared immediately.

Ms Aditi....l learned a lot and one of those lessons is consistency and hardworking to earn a better future since nothing is served for free .

Suggestions
Honestly from what l discovered, Edoofa is only known by people living in Harare, Mutare and Bulawayo for instance.It is not known to places like Chipinge where l reside.I thought l was gonna meet some of my fellow friends from Chipinge but unfortunately l predicted it wrongly.I would really appreciate it if the Edoofa Program would be known to places like this so that the golden opportunities pass through other intelligent, hardworking and self motivated students in Chipinge.The other problem was being doubtful and believing that Edoofa Program is a scam and might result in human trafficking.
My wish is for Edoofa team to clear such doubts from these young minds.Moreover,l would really love it if the next MEET AND GREET is held in Mutare if possible because traveling from Chipinge to Harare is expensive for instance me and mom had to spend about $70 for traveling expenses and l believe that is the number one reason why some students could not make it .
I hope you put this into consideration .

20/2/24, 7:47 PM - +263 78 101 2373: To sum it all up,l would like to thank the Team Edoofa for everything.Meeting in person was an opportunity of a life time.It was an educational and inspiring journey indeed.

Keep on working hard,raise the Edoofa Program flag higher and may God bless you 

NB: l really loved the event and hope to attend another one🔥👏☺️.
