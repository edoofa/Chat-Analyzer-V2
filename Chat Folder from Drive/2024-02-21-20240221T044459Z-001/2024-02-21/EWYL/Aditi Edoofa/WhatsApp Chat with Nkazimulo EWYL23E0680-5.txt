27/12/23, 8:44 AM - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.

So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

27/12/23, 9:15 AM - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

6/1/24, 1:27 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of *our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs*, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:27 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
6/1/24, 3:10 PM - +263 77 263 6730: This sounds interesting, enjoy the visit
11/1/24, 4:10 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hellooooo!!!!

I quickly just wanted to share the scoop on *Slice Con'24—it was seriously awesome!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️

While we were having multiple conversations with our students in the past few days for the meet & greet event, we figured that there is a slight confusion in the invitation dates. Hence, I wanted to quickly reach out and ensure that the same is not the case with you.

- As per the invitation, *you* are supposed to attend the event along with your parents on *19th of February* which is Monday.
 
- If you are recommending any of *your friends (Non Edoofians)* along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for *18th of February (8am/1pm) or 19th February(1pm)*. They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event.
17/2/24, 8:56 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Please ensure that you are present at the venue 30 minutes earlier and are dressed appropriately.
Don't forget to carry your admit card!

Cannot wait to see you there tomorrow! Hope you're excited too! 😃🕺🏻

20/2/24, 2:23 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Nkazimulo!

The past three days flew by in a whirlwind for Team Edoofa – both for those in India and those in Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. Now that we've had a chance to catch our breath, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success.

Your insights from the event are highly valued, and I'm keen to hear about your experience. Would you be open to sharing your thoughts, including your interest in attending similar events in the future and any suggestions for improvement? Additionally, if you have captured any memorable moments in photos, we would greatly appreciate you sharing them.

Your perspective is crucial, and I also encourage you to discuss the event with your parents and gather their feedback.
20/2/24, 3:27 PM - +263 78 929 8055: Hey Ms Aditi....The event was really good and l really enjoyed being part of it.l think it's crucial fir you as the EDOOFA tram to continue doing such kinds of events as they bring about hope to students and parents, clarification is made clear to those who won't be understanding about your Program😌and to add on to yesterday's meeting (especially the video that you showed to us)they actually drove fear out of me as l am now aware that there are some Zimbabwean students there who feel at home ,so l am also guaranteed that l will also be welcomed the warm hands and feel at home 😊.I also realized that the EDOOFA program helps one to be innovative,think out side the box , you make the youths understand that the world can be a better place with them .
20/2/24, 3:29 PM - +263 78 929 8055: My parents said that noticed that the program is truly meant to empower students with skills making them suitable for the industry.
They  also noticed that there was a balance in terms of gender both boys and girls were given equal opportunities to air their contributions.
To add on theyalso like the openness and transparency of the Edoofa team in explaining to the attendees how it operates, this served as a confidence booster for both parents and students.
On improvement they think you should consider having these interactions  In Harare, Masvingo and Bulawayo because some had to travel close to 600 kms and this forced them to travel overnight.
The program was worth participating,it gave us a
Clear picture of where we are going.
20/2/24, 3:41 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you so much for your heartfelt feedback. I'm truly delighted to hear that you found the event to be valuable and enjoyable. Your perspective on the importance of such events in providing hope, clarification, and a sense of belonging to students and parents alike is deeply appreciated.
I'm glad that the video presentation helped alleviate any fears you may have had and instilled confidence in you about joining our community. It's heartening to know that you see the Edoofa program as a platform for fostering innovation and empowering youth to make a positive impact in the world.
20/2/24, 3:41 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I'm also grateful for your parents' observations regarding the program's commitment to gender balance, transparency, and empowerment. Their insights are invaluable as we continually strive to improve and refine our offerings.
Your suggestion to expand our interactions to other cities like Harare, Masvingo, and Bulawayo is duly noted. We'll definitely take it into consideration for future events to ensure accessibility for all participants.

Thank you once again for taking the time to share your thoughts with us. Your feedback is instrumental. I look forward to welcoming you into the Edoofa community and witnessing your journey towards success.🚀 <This message was edited>
