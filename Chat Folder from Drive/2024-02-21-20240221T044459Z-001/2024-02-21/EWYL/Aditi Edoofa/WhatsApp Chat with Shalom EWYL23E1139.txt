6/2/24, 1:43 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am well. Thanks for asking!
6/2/24, 1:44 PM - +263 78 723 1295: That's great,,,,,, now in the mood to begin our session
6/2/24, 1:48 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
6/2/24, 1:48 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
6/2/24, 1:58 PM - +263 78 723 1295: The other 2, that's my mom and dad, and the remaining l think they are from Edoofa
6/2/24, 1:59 PM - Aditi Edoofa: It's wonderful to connect with your parents. I extend a warm welcome to them for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey
6/2/24, 2:00 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
6/2/24, 2:02 PM - +263 78 723 1295: It is also our pleasure for connecting with you
6/2/24, 2:12 PM - +263 78 723 1295: Goals are set in life so that one can set an example and also to put their whole forcus and effort towards their gaols.

This is what l have done and l have already made my mind completely that one day my goals will be fulfilled. My long term goal is to become a successful and trustworthy young Bio Technological doctor in the future. Having a degree in medicine is one of my dreams because l have loved to become one from the beginning.  And with this l am doing my best to achieve and fulfill this since it does not come on a silver plate but rather requires maximum effort.
6/2/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: It's truly inspiring to hear about your determination and commitment to your goals! Setting clear objectives is essential for paving the path to success and making a positive impact. Your ambition to become a trustworthy young Bio Technological doctor is commendable, and pursuing a degree in medicine aligns perfectly with your passion and aspirations. Your proactive approach and dedicated efforts are key ingredients for achieving this dream, and I have no doubt that with your perseverance, you'll excel in your journey towards becoming a successful professional in the field. Keep up the incredible work, and may your unwavering determination guide you to the fulfillment of your aspirations!
6/2/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
6/2/24, 2:16 PM - +263 78 723 1295: No you can say a little bit about the two key objectives
6/2/24, 2:17 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
6/2/24, 2:17 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
6/2/24, 2:18 PM - +263 78 723 1295: That's so incredible and very helpful
6/2/24, 2:18 PM - +263 73 242 8998: Greetings to everyone,  sorry joining you a bit late,  as parent to Shalom, I'm happy that all is progressing well and I am happy to offer you my maximum support to ensure our daughter achieves her desired goals in life.
6/2/24, 2:20 PM - +263 73 242 8998: We will connect whenever we manage in terms time
6/2/24, 2:21 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello and welcome! It's wonderful to have you join us, and your support means a great deal to us all. Shalom is fortunate to have such a supportive parent like you, dedicated to her success and aspirations. With your encouragement and our collective efforts, I have no doubt that she will accomplish remarkable things and achieve her goals in life. Thank you for your unwavering support, and let's work together to empower Shalom on her journey to success!
6/2/24, 2:22 PM - +263 73 242 8998: Thank you very much
6/2/24, 2:23 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
6/2/24, 2:31 PM - +263 78 723 1295: It is so lovely to meet you
6/2/24, 2:31 PM - Aditi Edoofa: They are also honored to have you!
6/2/24, 2:31 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Concluding our session, I want to say it's been an amazing conversation.
Have a good day!
6/2/24, 2:35 PM - +263 78 723 1295: Well appreciated the most
Be blessed
7/2/24, 1:30 PM - +263 78 723 1295: Greetings everyone
7/2/24, 1:31 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon!☀️
Hope you are well.

Are you ready for the session?🚀
7/2/24, 1:32 PM - +263 78 723 1295: Yes we can begin
7/2/24, 1:33 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
7/2/24, 1:34 PM - +263 78 723 1295: Yeah sounds very brilliant indeed
7/2/24, 1:39 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.
7/2/24, 1:39 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
7/2/24, 1:39 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
7/2/24, 2:01 PM - +263 78 723 1295: I have gone through the letters
7/2/24, 2:02 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
7/2/24, 2:04 PM - +263 78 723 1295: Yes I would love that too
7/2/24, 2:04 PM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
7/2/24, 2:06 PM - +263 78 723 1295: It is so amazing and l feel very safe in your hands
7/2/24, 2:07 PM - Aditi Edoofa: That's such a kind compliment, thank you!
7/2/24, 2:07 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now, I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
7/2/24, 2:07 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube

4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is.
7/2/24, 2:33 PM - Aditi Edoofa: We're finishing up our session now! 😊 It's been awesome, and I can't wait for our next one! 🚀
7/2/24, 2:38 PM - +263 78 723 1295: 1. My EWYL Mentor is Ms Aditi and l'm very great indeed to have her as my mentor. Not forgetting Ms. Sanjana who is the Head of the Department and all group conservations will be monitored. We also have Ms. David who is the Head couch and they will ensure that l achieve the desired skillet through the EWYL course. I very pleased to have them as my team.

2. My mentor has set goals for me and this includes making sure that my academic journey is GREAT. Also she will ensure that l have been given enough opportunities to self-finance my higher education and most importantly to work towards attaining the main objective, that l am learning and evolving with the relevant 21st century skills.

3. Through the Newsletter

4. The hall of inspiration was written by one of the Edoofians and it has truly explained that going to school is not all about being a legend in academics or sports but rather should also be able to interact with your society. One should be kind and generous to help the needy  and the privileged.This helps you to feel better and you will be grateful to raise someone for his/her better standards.

This helps and moulds a student to be always along with current online business skills and activities.

9/2/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: This is great!
9/2/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!

20/2/24, 11:00 AM - +263 78 723 1295: Keep up the good work indeed!!!
20/2/24, 2:14 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Shalom!

The past three days flew by in a whirlwind for Team Edoofa – both for those in India and those in Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. Now that we've had a chance to catch our breath, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success.

Your insights from the event are highly valued, and I'm keen to hear about your experience. Would you be open to sharing your thoughts, including your interest in attending similar events in the future and any suggestions for improvement? Additionally, if you have captured any memorable moments in photos, we would greatly appreciate you sharing them.

Your perspective is crucial, and I also encourage you to discuss the event with your parents and gather their feedback.
20/2/24, 2:29 PM - +263 78 723 1295: The Meet and Greet'24 was very amazing and fantastic. Meeting people you have been communicating with on social media platforms is such a relief and we really appreciate. This helps us to each other even better regardless the interaction before and it also helps us to get more detailed information. Besides that it also links and creates a bond between *US* as Edoofians as we get to know each other and we will not feel lonely when we get there as we have made a lot friends here during your meetings.
