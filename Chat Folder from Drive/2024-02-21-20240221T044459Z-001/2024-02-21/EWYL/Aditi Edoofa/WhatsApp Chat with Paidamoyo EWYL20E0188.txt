I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out to you regarding your absence from yesterday's event. We understand that sometimes unexpected circumstances can arise, causing obstacles for us.

That's why we have arranged a special meeting with one of the founders Mr. Avreen Singh and the Head of Admissions, Ms. Vilsha. This will provide you with an opportunity to cover what you have missed today.
