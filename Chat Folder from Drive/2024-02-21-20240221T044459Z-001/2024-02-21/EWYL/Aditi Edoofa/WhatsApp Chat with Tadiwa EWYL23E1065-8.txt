29/12/23, 8:35 AM - +263 71 438 9968: My parents are also in the group,Mr and Mrs Muchada. My mother is a secretary and my father is self employed.
29/12/23, 8:40 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that, Tadiwa. It's great to know that your parents, Mr. and Mrs. Muchada, are also part of the group. It seems like you come from a diverse background with your mother working as a secretary and your father being self-employed. I extend a warm welcome to them for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey.
29/12/23, 8:41 AM - +263 71 438 9968: Thank you so much.
29/12/23, 8:48 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
29/12/23, 8:52 AM - +263 71 438 9968: My long term goals include
Getting a degree in pharmacy, building my own pharmacy, improving my communication skills,getting good grades in all my studies, develop a positive mindset.
The EWYL program will help me achieve these goals by reducing the amount of costs and tuition fee that i have to pay
29/12/23, 8:56 AM - Aditi Edoofa: It's fantastic to hear about your long-term goals, Tadiwa! Pursuing a degree in pharmacy, establishing your own pharmacy, improving communication skills, maintaining excellent grades, and developing a positive mindset are admirable objectives.🎯 The EWYL program will surely help you achieve these goals, particularly by reducing the financial burden associated with tuition fees and costs. This support can undoubtedly pave the way for your academic and professional aspirations. ✨
29/12/23, 8:57 AM - +263 71 438 9968: Yesss. Thank you
29/12/23, 8:59 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
29/12/23, 9:00 AM - +263 71 438 9968: Please enlighten me
29/12/23, 9:03 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
29/12/23, 9:03 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
29/12/23, 9:04 AM - +263 71 438 9968: I understand.
29/12/23, 9:06 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
29/12/23, 9:08 AM - +263 71 438 9968: Thank you. Nice to meet you Ms Sanjana and Ms Davi
29/12/23, 9:13 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Indeed! They are also honored to have you.
29/12/23, 9:13 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
29/12/23, 9:18 AM - +263 71 438 9968: Yess indeed. Noted
29/12/23, 9:19 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

29/12/23, 9:42 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now we are concluding our session!
As we are going to embark on a new chapter at the dawn of the New Year, I wanted to take a moment to send my warmest wishes your way. May this coming year be filled with joy, laughter, and moments of profound happiness. 🌈

Along with you, the Edoofa Family will also be occupied in *New Year Celebrations from tomorrow till 1 January 2024* and we will *resume from 2 January onwards*🎉

2/1/24, 9:12 AM - +263 71 438 9968: 3. Through the newsletter
2/1/24, 9:16 AM - +263 71 438 9968: 4. The hall of inspiration is a section in the newsletter where edoofians get to share their different experiences that shaped them or motivated them to become better people. It also helps other students to learn from their fellow colleagues and they also become motivated
2/1/24, 9:17 AM - Aditi Edoofa: This is amazing!✨

The EWYL program trains me to be updated on how jobs of the future will look like as well as the events happening around tge world that affect my career so thaf I will be able to adapt and bring changes that ensure a successful career.

4/1/24, 1:59 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

4/1/24, 2:10 PM - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
4/1/24, 2:11 PM - +263 71 438 9968: Thank you
4/1/24, 2:11 PM - +263 71 438 9968: Noted.
4/1/24, 2:11 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
4/1/24, 2:12 PM - +263 71 438 9968: Yes please
4/1/24, 2:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*TADIWA/ADITI*
4/1/24, 2:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
4/1/24, 2:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
4/1/24, 2:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

4/1/24, 2:14 PM - +263 71 438 9968: Yes Ms Aditi
4/1/24, 2:14 PM - +263 71 438 9968: Thank you so much
4/1/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!
4/1/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
4/1/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

5/1/24, 9:00 AM - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

11/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 71 438 9968: I do not know about SEO
11/1/24, 1:51 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So here is a brief about this term:

SEO (Search Engine Optimization): Implementing effective SEO strategies ensures that our content reaches a wider online audience, improving visibility and engagement.
11/1/24, 1:51 PM - +263 71 438 9968: Okay thank you
11/1/24, 1:55 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
11/1/24, 1:56 PM - +263 71 438 9968: I understand.
11/1/24, 1:57 PM - Aditi Edoofa: There are a few additional things that are required for you to be selected for a project. I want you to share the following with me
1. Instagram Username
2. Facebook Username
3. A smiling photo of yours ✨ 
→ IN case you do not have an Instagram/Facebook account- I want you to create one, and then send it in the next 24-36 hours.
11/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 71 438 9968: Can you please further clarify creative content
11/1/24, 1:58 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Creative Content: We're committed to delivering content that stands out – creative, original, and valuable, leaving a lasting impact on our audience.
11/1/24, 1:58 PM - +263 71 438 9968: 1. Raven.spammmsss
2. Tadiwa Ruth
11/1/24, 2:00 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Awesome!
11/1/24, 2:00 PM - Aditi Edoofa: What about your smiling picture
11/1/24, 2:01 PM - +263 71 438 9968: I am sending it now
11/1/24, 2:01 PM - +263 71 438 9968: <Media omitted>
11/1/24, 2:08 PM - Aditi Edoofa: You look lovely!
11/1/24, 2:08 PM - +263 71 438 9968: Thank you.
11/1/24, 2:09 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
Please note a few things:
FIRST- Your Sessions will be on *TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
11/1/24, 2:09 PM - Aditi Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days you will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
11/1/24, 2:09 PM - Aditi Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
11/1/24, 2:09 PM - Aditi Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
11/1/24, 2:09 PM - Aditi Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Aditi, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
11/1/24, 2:09 PM - Aditi Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
11/1/24, 2:09 PM - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
11/1/24, 2:12 PM - +263 71 438 9968: Okay.Thank you
11/1/24, 2:16 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Your session is on Tuesday and Friday from 12:00- 1:30 PM. In your session, you are required to:
▪️Active participation in most of the sessions by being punctual and actively engaging in the discussions
▪️Follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' on the EWYL Line every day, every morning before 12 PM.
▪️Share your lesson and activity response before your session commences
▪️Sharing project updates
11/1/24, 2:16 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
11/1/24, 2:18 PM - +263 71 438 9968: Indeed.Thank you
11/1/24, 2:18 PM - +263 71 438 9968: I understand
11/1/24, 2:22 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Tadiwa, that concludes our initial orientation. I trust that you've gained valuable insights and anticipate that there will be more to come as we progress towards achieving great success. Our next point of contact will be on the EWYL Line during your scheduled sessions and will follow the Proud Edoofian ritual daily.
11/1/24, 2:23 PM - +263 71 438 9968: Yes indeed.Thank you very much

11/1/24, 4:17 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I quickly just wanted to share the scoop on *Slice Con'24—it was seriously awesome!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️

In light of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. *Today, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable* and I am confident that together, we will create something truly extraordinary.

17/2/24, 9:00 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning Tadiwa!

While we were having multiple conversations with our students in the past few days for the meet & greet event, we figured that there is a slight confusion in the invitation dates. Hence, I wanted to quickly reach out and ensure that the same is not the case with you.

- As per the invitation, *you* are supposed to attend the event along with your parents on *19th of February* which is Monday.
 
- If you are recommending any of *your friends (Non Edoofians)* along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for *18th of February (8am/1pm) or 19th February(1pm)*. They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event.
17/2/24, 9:00 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Please ensure that you are present at the venue 30 minutes earlier and are dressed appropriately.
Don't forget to carry your admit card!

Cannot wait to see you there tomorrow! Hope you're excited too! 😃🕺🏻
