6/1/24, 1:35 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Mbalenhle

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of *our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs*, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:35 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
6/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 77 957 0923: Wow that's really exciting news to hear from you and your team,thank you for sharing such and all the best in your visit.We long to hear and see what transpired after your visit 😀, please keep the ball rolling thank you 😊.
11/1/24, 4:18 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hellooooo!!!!

I quickly just wanted to share the scoop on *Slice Con'24—it was seriously awesome!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️

16/2/24, 2:05 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While we were having multiple conversations with our students in the past few days for the meet & greet event, we figured that there is a slight confusion in the invitation dates. Hence, I wanted to quickly reach out and ensure that the same is not the case with you.

- As per the invitation, you are supposed to attend the event along with your parents on 17th of February which is tomorrow. 
- If you are recommending any of your friends(Non Edoofians) along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for 18th of February(8am/1pm) or 19th  February(1pm). They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event.
16/2/24, 2:05 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Please ensure that you are present at the venue 30 minutes earlier and are dressed appropriately.
Don't forget to carry your admit card!

Cannot wait to see you there tomorrow! Hope you're excited too! 😃🕺🏻

20/2/24, 1:30 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Mbalenhle!

The past three days flew by in a whirlwind for Team Edoofa – both for those in India and those in Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. Now that we've had a chance to catch our breath, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success.

Your insights from the event are highly valued, and I'm keen to hear about your experience. Would you be open to sharing your thoughts, including your interest in attending similar events in the future and any suggestions for improvement? Additionally, if you have captured any memorable moments in photos, we would greatly appreciate you sharing them.

Your perspective is crucial, and I also encourage you to discuss the event with your parents and gather their feedback.

First of all I would like to extend my gratitude to the team that came this side and managed to feed us with different skills.I learnt a lot from them and the lessons they brought to us.I was happy to watch a video of the Slice On' 24 where Edoofians who are in India were sharing their skills and experiences.They also made sure for us the upcoming Edoofians for this year that we should feel home as India is home away from home and I loved that.I also noticed that besides learning there's entertainment even with the CEOs from different places.At the moment I do not have any suggestions but a big clap for the hard work from the Edoofa team🙏
20/2/24, 1:51 PM - +263 77 957 0923: Good day ma'am thanks God for meet  and Greet meeting for Edoofians with was successful. I also thank the team for lessons  and experiences shared.My suggestion is may we please have the meeting held at Bulawayo so as to catch a good number of students invited and parents in order to attain more as some students were awarded for that especially  those locals in Harare.To envelop we never managed to attend due to financial challenges. Since its miles going to the capital. 🙏🏻🙏🏻
