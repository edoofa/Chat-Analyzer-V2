2/2/24, 2:25 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Tanatswa!

I understand that circumstances led you to delay your higher education journey as of last year, after taking a significant step towards building your future through us and I am sure that you must have been in touch with our Admissions team to figure out the best available solutions for you. Since then, Edoofa has been on a journey of innovation, creating new opportunities for learning and growth for students like you!

While I was going through your conversation, It reminded me of how I started my education journey full of questions and aspirations, and therefore I wanted to check in and have a conversation about how you are doing currently. 
May I know how are you planning to move your journey ahead?🚀
2/2/24, 6:42 PM - +263 78 902 9727: Good day 
I am doing quite well, I hope you are well yourself
2/2/24, 6:44 PM - +263 78 902 9727: As my parents and I have stressed before, I have chosen to take a gap year asi figure out what I want to do in terms of higher education.
6/2/24, 2:58 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon!
Hope you are well.

Okay, Tanatswa but I feel that you should think again before taking a gap as it's not a wise decision, you still have time, I want you to think thoroughly on this. I hope that you have notified your admissions team regarding the same.

May I kindly be excused
Thank you

Hope you are well.

It's alright, your request to be excused is completely understandable given your attendance at last year's meet and greet, your gap year plans, and the short notice. Thank you for letting us know.
