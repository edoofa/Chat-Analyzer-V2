7/2/24, 11:31 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello, Michelin!

I have been expecting to hear from you for the past couple of days, but I can see you have not been able to get back to me due to certain reasons I am not aware of. You see, I was looking forward to having you at the event as I know how beneficial it is going to be for you. Most of my students have already quite enthusiastically reserved seats for themselves and their family and friends.

Is everything alright? Are you facing any challenges? Is there something you'd like to share?

15/2/24, 1:57 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Michelin,

I hope you are having a wonderful day. With the event just 2 days away, we are thrilled to host our Edoofians at the seminar. Regarding this, I wanted to follow up and ask if you had the chance to review my previous messages and share the content on your social media profiles?
16/2/24, 3:23 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Michelin!

While we were having multiple conversations with our students in the past few days for the meet & greet event, we figured that there is a slight confusion in the invitation dates. Hence, I wanted to quickly reach out and ensure that the same is not the case with you.

- As per the invitation, *you* are supposed to attend the event along with your parents on *17th of February* which is tomorrow. 
- If you are recommending any of *your friends (Non-Edoofians)* along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for *18th of February (8am/1pm) or 19th  February (1pm)*. They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event.
