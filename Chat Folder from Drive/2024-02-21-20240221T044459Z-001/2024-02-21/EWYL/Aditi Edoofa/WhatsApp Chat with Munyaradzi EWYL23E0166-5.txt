6/1/24, 5:25 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good day!
Hope you are well!

Keep it up, Munyaradzi!🚀
You have a long wayyyy to gooooo✨
6/1/24, 1:35 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of *our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs*, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:36 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
7/1/24, 5:11 AM - +263 78 091 8221: Okay. Noted.
11/1/24, 4:17 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hellooooo!!!!

I quickly just wanted to share the scoop on *Slice Con'24—it was seriously awesome!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️

23/1/24, 9:06 AM - Aditi Edoofa: *_🌟 URGENT UPDATE 🌟_*

Guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

In light of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. *Today, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable* and I am confident that together, we will create something truly extraordinary.

Well, here's something that's about to make it a whole lot easier for your friends, and it's too good not to share!

*Introducing ESAT* (Edoofa Scholastic Assessment Test) – an on-the-spot exam that promises immediate results, cutting the waiting time drastically. Your friends can fast-track to the interview round within just 24 hours! Imagine, no more weeks of anticipation.
10/2/24, 12:59 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Have you wondered, now that you are helping our student community to get bigger and better, it is only fair that we reciprocate your efforts by rewarding you! Here is the surprise!


👨‍👧 Bring 1 student, earn $0.40!
👨‍👧👨‍👧 Bring 1 student and 1 parent, earn $1!

*Your friend needs to choose "no" when asked if they are currently enrolled as a student at Edoofa.*

*Important Note* - Your friends are required to complete the registration(*https://bit.ly/edoofa-registration-form*) and bring their academic results(A & O level). This is essential for you to receive the necessary credits.

*Here is the message that your friend will share with the Edoofa team after completing the registration.*

10/2/24, 12:59 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now, here's where it gets really exciting – apart from the faster enrollment process, the day will feature eye-opening seminars and expert career counseling. It's not just about making the process shorter for your friends; it's about giving them the chance to explore a world of opportunities in India alongside you!

Imagine the joy of traveling to India together, creating memories that will last a lifetime. And guess what? You get to earn some extra bucks for every friend you bring on board.

Spread the word, share the joy, and let's make this journey even more memorable together! If you have any questions or need more info, I'm just a message away.
10/2/24, 1:26 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

12/2/24, 8:04 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good day!
Hope you are well.

So, basically, when the students fill out the registration form and select no as they are not enrolled with Edoofa, a contact number would be provided in the form where they are supposed to send this message, I hope it's clear now?

17/2/24, 10:40 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning Munyaradzi!

While we were having multiple conversations with our students in the past few days for the meet & greet event, we figured that there is a slight confusion in the invitation dates. Hence, I wanted to quickly reach out and ensure that the same is not the case with you.

- As per the invitation, *you* are supposed to attend the event along with your parents on *19th of February* which is Monday.
 
- If you are recommending any of *your friends (Non Edoofians)* along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for *18th of February (8am/1pm) or 19th February(1pm)*. They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event.
17/2/24, 10:40 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Please ensure that you are present at the venue 30 minutes earlier and are dressed appropriately.
Don't forget to carry your admit card!

Cannot wait to see you there on Monday! Hope you're excited too! 😃🕺🏻
18/2/24, 10:18 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning Munyaradzi!

We are ready to make your weekend extra special and worthwhile!  We do realize we've been reaching out to you a bit more frequently than usual 😃, but the wait is finally over, and we're bursting with excitement to meet you at the meet & greet event tomorrow!🕺🏻

While we make the necessary arrangements for you and your parents at the venue, could you please let us know who along with you is attending the event?
18/2/24, 10:18 AM - Aditi Edoofa: In the meanwhile, I am sharing a few pictures & clips of yesterday's seminar with you. Take a look!
