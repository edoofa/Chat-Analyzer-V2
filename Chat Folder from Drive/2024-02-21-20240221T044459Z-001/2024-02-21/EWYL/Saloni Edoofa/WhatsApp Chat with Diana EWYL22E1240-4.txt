27/12/23, 1:22 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Diana,
I hope this message finds you well.

As we approach the end of the year, I am filled with excitement about the upcoming new year. It's a time for optimism, hope, and the opportunity to nurture beautifully curated relationships. However, upon reflection on our journey so far, I recognize a bit of inconsistency and irregularity.

I understand that the holiday season, including Christmas celebrations and New Year enjoyment, may be keeping you occupied. Despite this, I believe it's important for us to consider how we can strengthen our relationship in the EWYL Program. I am eager to hear your thoughts on how we can restart and enhance our collaboration.
11/1/24, 11:05 AM - +263 77 235 0984: Hello Saloni,
I hope I find you well..I come with a heavy heart to let you know that Diana could not make the grade you wanted for university intake..she failed all the subjects and in that regard I will need her to repeat..I will therefore ask for the refund of $350us that I had previously deposited for her enrollment... thanking you in advance and hoping to continue communicating should she make it next time..
Thanking you in advance and please let me know when I would expect the refund.
12/1/24, 8:43 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day, Diana and parents!
How are you?
12/1/24, 8:45 AM - Saloni Edoofa: I'm truly sorry to hear about Diana's academic challenges. It's indeed unfortunate news. To assist you further and better understand the situation, could you please provide Diana's marksheets for a more comprehensive understanding of the same?

How are you?
16/1/24, 8:31 AM - Saloni Edoofa: May I know if you discussed the same with the Admission Team?
16/1/24, 9:32 AM - +263 77 235 0984: Good morning,,no I didn't discuss with Admission team
16/1/24, 4:23 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I would request that you discuss the same with the Admission Team first so that they can provide you with the right direction.
27/1/24, 7:42 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day!
I hope you're doing well.

I know from the past few days, that I could not respond but allow me to share a story very close to my heart🫰🏻

I became a part of Edoofa almost two years back with initial thoughts on how my relationship would be, will I be a good mentor, or will I be able to think like my students, and so on. With these thoughts, I began my journey. Honestly speaking, I learned a lot each day, and yes, made some mistakes but I did not know that now there is going something that I will cherish for my lifetime, our bond. In this journey so far, I have guided more than 500 students, and beyond guidance I have made sure that I can create a transformation in their lives🌟
27/1/24, 7:42 PM - Saloni Edoofa: As an individual, I always believe that the learning process is life never ends and the more you learn, the better the guidance becomes, with a heavy heart, *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor🥺*
*You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

*I want to assure you that the Mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
All the best🫶🏻

 Great news – there's a reserved spot just for you in the registration process!

7/2/24, 1:02 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Hello, Diana!

I have been expecting to hear from you for the past couple of days, but I can see you have not been able to get back to me due to certain reasons I am not aware of. You see, I had really been looking forward to having you at the event as I know how beneficial it is going to be for you. Most of my students have already quite enthusiastically reserved seats for themselves and their family and friends.

Is everything alright? Are you facing any challenges? Is there something you'd like to share?
