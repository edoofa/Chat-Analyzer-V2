29/12/23, 4:27 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day,

You know when I was a student and till now, I make agendas on what I wish to achieve in life this year, and how I can transform it for the betterment of not just myself, but my family and the people around me. Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.
I, as your wellwisher and companion, wish you that you also push yourself and make the most of the opportunities that are coming your way starting from the EWYL Program that offers you a chance to *stand on your own feet*. Next year, _we will be a few months away from our flight to India_✈️, and I want to see you living a journey till that time that is filled with *hard work and dedication*. I have personally curated this message from the bottom of my heart to wish you a very *Happy New Year, 2024* 🫶🏻

How are you?

This week we will be having our session on *Tuesday and Friday* from *12:00 - 01:30 PM* on the *EWYL Line*.
In our session for today, we will be discussing:
1. Project updates
Since we don’t have the Saturday activity to be discussed for our session today, I want you to come with any concerns you have to work on the Community Building project and the African School project in our session today. I want us to start accelerating our performance so that we can utilize the time to give our utmost on working on the projects.

This all will be done on the *EWYL Line*, please make sure you follow the daily ritual of saying *'I am a proud edoofian'* every morning.
16/1/24, 10:04 AM - +263 77 923 2295: Good morning
27/1/24, 8:33 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day!
I hope you're doing well.

I know from the past few days, that I could not respond but allow me to share a story very close to my heart🫰🏻

I became a part of Edoofa almost two years back with initial thoughts on how my relationship would be, will I be a good mentor, or will I be able to think like my students, and so on. With these thoughts, I began my journey. Honestly speaking, I learned a lot each day, and yes, made some mistakes but I did not know that now there is going something that I will cherish for my lifetime, our bond. In this journey so far, I have guided more than 500 students, and beyond guidance I have made sure that I can create a transformation in their lives🌟
27/1/24, 8:33 PM - Saloni Edoofa: As an individual, I always believe that the learning process is life never ends and the more you learn, the better the guidance becomes, with a heavy heart, *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor🥺*
*You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

*I want to assure you that the Mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
All the best🫶🏻
30/1/24, 8:38 AM - +263 77 923 2295: Thank you Ms Saloni for mentoring me

12/2/24, 6:51 PM - +263 77 252 6859: Dear Programme Director and Proud Edoofian.
RE:Withdrawal from programme participation for Rivhathihi M. Ndou.

The referenced subject has a bearing. I hereby write to withdraw Rivhathihi's participation from the Edoofian programme.This was necessitated by the unfavourable performance in her Advanced level results and we have thought it reasonable as an area for improvement ,for her to re-enrol for the June 2024 examinations.lt is our hope that she might re-join the program when done in future.
Thank you for your unwavering support.
14/2/24, 4:56 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Rivhathihi.

I hope you are doing well. I understand your situation and it is completely reasonable if she wishes to reappear in the A-Level examinations later this year. However, I would like to inform you that even in such a case, you need not withdraw your application from the Edoofa Scholarship Program. We are here to support and guide you through this situation. There are still a few options that Rivhathihi can go for with Edoofa. Allow me to help you understand the same better.
14/2/24, 4:57 PM - Saloni Edoofa: *1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then. 

Because of this exclusive benefit, she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for her exams, and her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year.
14/2/24, 4:58 PM - Saloni Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.

Once you complete your diploma course in India, she will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if she wants, she will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
14/2/24, 4:58 PM - Saloni Edoofa: *3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
14/2/24, 5:00 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I would kindly urge you to go through the above options and discuss the same with your family once. Moreover, you can gain more clarity on the way forward and these options by having a conversation with our Head of Admissions Ms. Vilsha, who will be present in Harare for the Meet and Greet Event. I believe it will be really helpful for you, as you will get the opportunity to discover more options that you can avail and gain a better understanding of them as well.
20/2/24, 9:27 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Rivathihi!

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out to you regarding your absence from Saturday's event. We understand that sometimes unexpected circumstances can arise, causing obstacles for us.

That's why our whole team has extended their trip for one day so that they can assist you. This will provide you with an opportunity to cover what you missed on Saturday. You will also be able to discuss the way forward for Rivhathihi's education.

Date: *20th Feb 2024*
Time: *10:00 AM onwards*
Venue: *Conference room, N1 Hotel, Rotten Row, Harare*

Let me know about your availability as soon as possible so that I can pass through your name to our team.
