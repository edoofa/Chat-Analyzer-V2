While we were having multiple conversations with our students in the past few days for the meet & greet event, we figured that there is a slight confusion in the invitation dates. Hence, I wanted to quickly reach out and ensure that the same is not the case with yo*.

- As per the invitation, you are supposed to attend the event along with your parents on 19th of February which is Mond*y.
 
- If you are recommending any of your friends (Non Edoofians) along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for 18th of February (8am/1pm) or 19th February(1pm). They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event.
17/2/24, 10:35 AM - Rithvik Edoofa: Please ensure that you are present at the venue 30 minutes earlier and are dressed appropriately.
Don't forget to carry your admit card!

20/2/24, 7:17 AM - +263 78 581 9582: Morning team . Thank you for hosting such a memorable event . Learnt a lot about Edoofa that l didn’t before how much of a big impact it is doing for many kids in Zimbabwe and africa as a whole.  The opportunity to meet the CEO of some of the big companies in India and be able to present  in front of them is in itself a blessing . 


 Am l disappointed with myself as l could have done more to be part of the organization team . I hope in the near future l can be able to participate  helping in any way l can .  The testimony of that guy who spent 6 years in India was really moving to see that he is now able to give back the knowledge he learnt to Zimbabwe it is something special . 

 Cant wait to start of my Education .  Than you team for such a whole sum experience. 


 Am a proud EDOOFIAN  and it is my blood . 

 Thank you
20/2/24, 8:10 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Thank you for your feedback, Albert! I am glad you had such a great time
