27/1/24, 7:29 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day!
I hope you're doing well.

I know from the past few days, that I could not respond but allow me to share a story very close to my heart🫰🏻

I became a part of Edoofa almost two years back with initial thoughts on how my relationship would be, will I be a good mentor, or will I be able to think like my students, and so on. With these thoughts, I began my journey. Honestly speaking, I learned a lot each day, and yes, made some mistakes but I did not know that now there is going something that I will cherish for my lifetime, our bond. In this journey so far, I have guided more than 500 students, and beyond guidance I have made sure that I can create a transformation in their lives🌟
27/1/24, 7:29 PM - Saloni Edoofa: As an individual, I always believe that the learning process is life never ends and the more you learn, the better the guidance becomes, with a heavy heart, *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor🥺*
*You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

*I want to assure you that the Mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
All the best🫶🏻

Doesn't that sound like an opportunity you wouldn't want to miss?

He will dive into some fantastic opportunities for your career that await you, offering valuable insights you won't want to miss. But that's not all you also need to brace yourself for engaging in conversations with the Edoofa team, where you'll get the chance to connect, learn, and explore. And here's the cherry on top – there's an offline scholarship test waiting for you, adding an exciting twist to the whole experience. It's going to be definitely an unforgettable event filled with learning and opportunities!

So, I would strongly suggest you to attend the event!
