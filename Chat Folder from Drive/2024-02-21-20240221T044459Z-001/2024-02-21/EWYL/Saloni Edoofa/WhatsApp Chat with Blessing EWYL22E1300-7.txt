26/12/23, 9:48 AM - Saloni Edoofa: TODAY, I would like you to connect with your School Head. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all your schoolmates.
26/12/23, 9:48 AM - Saloni Edoofa: May I know if you have the Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him/her for your School Head’s Contact.
26/12/23, 9:48 AM - +27 79 477 6231: I don't have the contact

27/12/23, 9:57 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Please note a few things:
FIRST- Your session will be from 12:00-01:30 PM on
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
27/12/23, 9:57 AM - Saloni Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (*MONDAY and THURSDAY*), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
27/12/23, 9:57 AM - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
27/12/23, 9:57 AM - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
27/12/23, 9:57 AM - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
27/12/23, 9:57 AM - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
27/12/23, 9:57 AM - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

28/12/23, 9:49 AM - Saloni Edoofa: I'd like to share the success story of our star performer from last week, Loice. She successfully identified and reached out to three potential schools to meet her targets. Interestingly, she utilized Google for her research. Loice performed searches like 'School nearby,' 'School in Harare,' and 'School in Manicaland,' generating valuable results. Remarkably, she achieved this without physically visiting the schools. Using Google, she gathered essential information, including contact details, and then initiated communication with them via WhatsApp.
28/12/23, 9:55 AM - +27 79 477 6231: It's nice l will also try to utilize google
28/12/23, 9:56 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Great Blessing!

27/1/24, 7:33 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day!
I hope you're doing well.

I know from the past few days, that I could not respond but allow me to share a story very close to my heart🫰🏻

I became a part of Edoofa almost two years back with initial thoughts on how my relationship would be, will I be a good mentor, or will I be able to think like my students, and so on. With these thoughts, I began my journey. Honestly speaking, I learned a lot each day, and yes, made some mistakes but I did not know that now there is going something that I will cherish for my lifetime, our bond. In this journey so far, I have guided more than 500 students, and beyond guidance I have made sure that I can create a transformation in their lives🌟
27/1/24, 7:33 PM - Saloni Edoofa: As an individual, I always believe that the learning process is life never ends and the more you learn, the better the guidance becomes, with a heavy heart, *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor🥺*
*You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

*I want to assure you that the Mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
All the best🫶🏻
2/2/24, 10:48 AM - Saloni Edoofa: *Hello, Blessing, this is an official announcement from Team Edoofa!*

 Great news – there's a reserved spot just for you in the registration process! 
We understand that sometimes deadlines can be challenging to meet. Missing the registration fee deadline might seem like a roadblock, however, it isn't yet! Your dedication matters the most to us.

I am sure that your admissions officers must have already taken the first steps, and as a mentor, it is my advice to you to have transparency in your conversations so that we can help you fulfill your goal of arriving in India for your higher education! ✅

There’s a catch! You now have a chance to fast-track your admissions process and meet your officers too! 😀
2/2/24, 10:48 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Join our unique event in Harare with 5000+ participants for a meet & greet, Q&A, and fast-track admission to your journey to India. Bring your parents for a deeper understanding of the program. *To secure your seats, kindly let us know how many seats shall be reserved for you.*✨
7/2/24, 1:17 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Hello, Blessing!

I have been expecting to hear from you for the past couple of days, but I can see you have not been able to get back to me due to certain reasons I am not aware of. You see, I had really been looking forward to having you at the event as I know how beneficial it is going to be for you. Most of my students have already quite enthusiastically reserved seats for themselves and their family and friends.

Is everything alright? Are you facing any challenges? Is there something you'd like to share?
7/2/24, 3:48 PM - +27 79 477 6231: Yes there is,
I have managed to secure a place somewhere else.
