27/12/23, 10:03 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Henriata,
How are you?

I am sure you are very excited about today's session🫶🏻
27/12/23, 10:04 AM - +263 71 563 0656: Yes l am ......we may begin the session
27/12/23, 10:05 AM - Saloni Edoofa: May I know if you have understood till here?
27/12/23, 10:07 AM - +263 71 563 0656: Yes ma'am l did
27/12/23, 10:12 AM - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
27/12/23, 10:12 AM - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Henriata/Saloni/27DEC2023*
27/12/23, 10:12 AM - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
27/12/23, 10:12 AM - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
27/12/23, 10:13 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
27/12/23, 10:13 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
27/12/23, 10:53 AM - +263 77 269 9037: Good morning. I'm sorry to inform you that Henriata'"s phone has run out of battery and there is no electricity to recharge the battery
27/12/23, 10:55 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Oh no worries, I can understand that.
27/12/23, 11:01 AM - Saloni Edoofa: As we wrap up today's session, I'm eager to reconnect with you tomorrow during our EWYL Group meeting from 10:00-11:00 AM! 🌟 Anticipate another engaging and fruitful session. I'm excited about what we'll achieve together. See you there
28/12/23, 9:59 AM - +263 71 563 0656: Good morning ma'am ........lm very sorry for yesterday's incident my phone ran out of battery all of a sudden .....once again am sory
28/12/23, 10:00 AM - +263 71 563 0656: I have already formed a group Ma'am
28/12/23, 10:00 AM - +263 71 563 0656: The students are now asking about the application forms they filled in
28/12/23, 10:06 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Henriata,

28/12/23, 10:31 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Great Henriata! <This message was edited>
28/12/23, 10:31 AM - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.

28/12/23, 10:40 AM - Saloni Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of* more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
 
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains

28/12/23, 10:45 AM - +263 71 563 0656: Okay ma'am noted
28/12/23, 10:46 AM - Saloni Edoofa: I'm [Your Name], grateful for the Edoofa Scholarship taking me to study in India. With high tuition fees in Zimbabwe, this opportunity is a dream come true.
Back in Zimbabwe, internet costs were steep—around $500 annually. In India, it's just $40 a year, showing how much they value education.
In Zimbabwe, limited seats and job struggles after graduation were concerns. Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program eased these worries, offering $50 to $100 monthly.
Following the 5S principles helped me secure this scholarship. I encourage you to do the same. Counselors will ask questions based on the flyer attached.
Best of luck! Your dreams are closer than you think.

4/1/24, 10:30 AM - Saloni Edoofa: May I know if you have the Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him/her for your School Head’s Contact.

12/1/24, 10:05 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Please note a few things:

*TUESDAY and FRIDAY* from 12:00 - 01:30 PM
12/1/24, 10:05 AM - Saloni Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
12/1/24, 10:05 AM - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.

12/1/24, 10:05 AM - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
12/1/24, 10:05 AM - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
12/1/24, 10:10 AM - +263 71 563 0656: Ma'am today is Friday so are we suppose to begin our session at 1200

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *a lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as a mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
16/1/24, 12:19 PM - Saloni Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of* more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
 
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains

27/1/24, 7:48 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day!
I hope you're doing well.

I know from the past few days, that I could not respond but allow me to share a story very close to my heart🫰🏻

I became a part of Edoofa almost two years back with initial thoughts on how my relationship would be, will I be a good mentor, or will I be able to think like my students, and so on. With these thoughts, I began my journey. Honestly speaking, I learned a lot each day, and yes, made some mistakes but I did not know that now there is going something that I will cherish for my lifetime, our bond. In this journey so far, I have guided more than 500 students, and beyond guidance I have made sure that I can create a transformation in their lives🌟
27/1/24, 7:48 PM - Saloni Edoofa: As an individual, I always believe that the learning process is life never ends and the more you learn, the better the guidance becomes, with a heavy heart, *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor🥺*
*You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

*I want to assure you that the Mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
All the best🫶🏻
28/1/24, 8:37 PM - +263 71 563 0656: Thank you ma'am for the updates ....and hope you don't regret having me as your student
