Quick question: *When are you available to resume EWYL sessions?* Share the date that suits you best. Can't wait! 🌈
27/1/24, 8:29 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *Greetings of the day, Tarriro*
I hope this message finds you in good spirits. I want to share some heartfelt news with you. After careful consideration, I've come to a decision that carries a mix of emotions. *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor.*

As we journey through this moment, I can't help but feel a mix of emotions realizing that our daily interactions are about to change. *Saying goodbye to our current way of connecting brings a bittersweet feeling*, but deep down, I see change as a chance for growth and the discovery of new opportunities.

Reflecting on our shared journey, I am truly humbled by the extraordinary moments we've experienced together—the bonds we've forged, the shared laughter, and the countless instances of mutual growth and learning.
27/1/24, 8:31 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

Thank you for being an integral part of my life's journey. Keep radiating brilliance, dare to dream ambitiously, and always remember the remarkable potential within you. 
*I want to assure you that the mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
27/1/24, 9:37 PM - +263 78 350 7185: Thank you
2/2/24, 8:21 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *Hello, Tariro, this is an official announcement from Team Edoofa!*

 Great news – there's a reserved spot just for you in the registration process! 
We understand that sometimes deadlines can be challenging to meet. Missing the registration fee deadline might seem like a roadblock, however, it isn't yet! Your dedication matters the most to us.

I am sure that your admissions officers must have already taken the first steps, and as a mentor, it is my advice to you to have transparency in your conversations so that we can help you fulfill your goal of arriving in India for your higher education! ✅

There’s a catch! You now have a chance to fast-track your admissions process and meet your officers too! 😀 <This message was edited>

Bring your parents for a deeper understanding of the program. To secure your seats, kindly let us know how many seats shall be reserved for you.✨
7/2/24, 12:44 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Hello, Tariro

I have been expecting to hear from you for the past couple of days, but I can see you have not been able to get back to me due to certain reasons I am not aware of. You see, I had really been looking forward to having you at the event as I know how beneficial it is going to be for you. Most of my students have already quite enthusiastically reserved seats for themselves and their family and friends.

Is everything alright? Are you facing any challenges? Is there something you'd like to share?
7/2/24, 1:21 PM - +263 78 350 7185: Afternoon, it seems Tariro is no longer intersted because of the program she was offered BTech. She said she wants medicine
7/2/24, 4:11 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Well, have you had a word with your admission officer regarding the same?
7/2/24, 4:30 PM - +263 78 350 7185: Yes but they was no good response
8/2/24, 5:10 PM - +263 71 241 2855: Are there any chances of getting Medicine for Tariro. If yes then we can pay the amount that is required.
