I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:34 PM - Sharda Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. I want to share some heartfelt news with you. After careful consideration, I've come to a decision that carries a mix of emotions. *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor.*

As we journey through this moment, I can't help but feel a mix of emotions realizing that our daily interactions are about to change. *Saying goodbye to our current way of connecting brings a bittersweet feeling*, but deep down, I see change as a chance for growth and the discovery of new opportunities.

Reflecting on our shared journey, I am truly humbled by the extraordinary moments we've experienced together—the bonds we've forged, the shared laughter, and the countless instances of mutual growth and learning.
