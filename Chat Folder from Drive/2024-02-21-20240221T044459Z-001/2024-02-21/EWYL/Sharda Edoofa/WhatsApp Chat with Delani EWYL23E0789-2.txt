6/1/24, 1:44 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Good day Delani
I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:50 PM - Sharda Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
16/1/24, 9:15 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Good morning 

You have a *session scheduled today on the EWYL Line from 9:30am. I am waiting for you on the EWYL Line*. Kindly come to the line and say you are ready for the session.
22/1/24, 8:18 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Good evening, Delani

I am thrilled to share with you that a very special opportunity awaits you tomorrow. I have managed to schedule a special one on one session with the *Program Head Ms Sanjana.* The session would be held from *3:00 pm to 4:30 pm CAT*. This is one opportunity I do not wish for you to miss, so do ensure you are online and prepared with your questions on time!!

The time slot has been very carefully decided, keeping in mind the fact that most students are usually available during their lunch breaks or after school.
22/1/24, 8:55 PM - +263 71 933 0584: Okay i will be available
23/1/24, 2:57 PM - +263 71 933 0584: Good afternoon
23/1/24, 3:01 PM - +263 71 933 0584: I am available for my session
23/1/24, 3:17 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Good afternoon, Delani, how are you doing today?
23/1/24, 3:18 PM - +263 71 933 0584: I am doing fine thank you
23/1/24, 3:30 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: I am glad to know, Delani
23/1/24, 3:31 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Delani, I was having a conversation with Ms. Sharda earlier and she walked me through your progress in your EWYL sessions lately. Would you mind walking me through your expectations that you have from the program ahead and how is it that you wish to fulfil them by through the help from the mentorship team? <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 3:38 PM - +263 71 933 0584: Mostly from the ewyl program i expect to gain more knowledge and experience on how to handle issues regarding life problems such as social interaction and use of social media to market 
Even though i have been facing challenges i can gladly say i have been learning a lot
Especially from the Wednesday wisdom lessons
The main issue is the issue of trust from my community so as to hinder this i would love if you guys organized even a seminar for a day or two this side in Bulawayo where i can invite parents to come and listen to you explain about the program and gain their trust because i face challenges where parents say they cannot deal with people they have never met before
23/1/24, 3:49 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Well, Delani. I am very happy to read your detailed response. This actually shows your clarity of thought and purpose towards the EWYL program.
23/1/24, 3:50 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: I hope you understand that your success would only be possible if you show up to working on your aspirations every single day and (in narrower focus) also towards making your contributions towards your EWYL program regularly. Contributions can be of any scale - big or small. However, they should always result into learnings. You can obtain those learning from your sessions with your mentor, projects, wednesday lessons, etc. I hope that you make the most of it.
23/1/24, 3:51 PM - +263 71 933 0584: Yes i definitely do
23/1/24, 4:04 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Delani, I wanted to make use of this special one-on-ones that I don't really get to do often. Similarly, the goal that I have for you and all your fellow Edoofians who are a part of the EWYL program is to earn Scholarship Credits. 

May I know your progess in the projects that you have been given?
23/1/24, 4:05 PM - +263 71 933 0584: I have not yet managed to get someone to register
23/1/24, 4:05 PM - +263 71 933 0584: For the program
23/1/24, 4:27 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: That is perfectly fine, Delani. As of now I am only concerned about your regular inputs that you have been making. I hope you understand that the projects are very carefully crafted to not only ensure that you earn credits but to foster marketable skills like leadership, accountability, content creation, etc. 

You must and should approach your projects as practical applications to your learnings.
23/1/24, 4:28 PM - +263 71 933 0584: Okay will do so
23/1/24, 4:40 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Glad to know, Delani
23/1/24, 4:41 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Before I end the session, Delani
23/1/24, 4:41 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: In recent years, Edoofa has come to be synonymous with events and seminars that are conducted on a grand scale, and has attempted to deepen the impact it leaves on the students who choose to be a part of the same. 

I wanted to personally share with you that in the upcoming weeks, we shall have the most esteemed members of *Team Edoofa visiting various countries all over Africa*, with the sole aim to connect with and inspire students such as yourself, and to guide them on their quest to build meaningful careers and await you on your journey to India. They shall also connect with visionaries, educationists, industrialists, school headmasters, principals to share learnings and collaborate in ways that benefit the learners like you! ⭐
23/1/24, 4:41 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: I hope this sounds interesting to you?
23/1/24, 4:44 PM - +263 71 933 0584: Music to my ears
23/1/24, 4:50 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Excellent! 😃
23/1/24, 4:51 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: It is now time to conclude the session. I am glad that I got an opportunity to connect with you today, and look forward to having more such sessions wherein I can gain more insight into your experiences of being a Proud Edoofian! Take care of yourself, work hard, the sky is the limit! 

Do ensure you stay connected with the EWYL Team to know your schedule further. Have a great day ahead!
23/1/24, 4:54 PM - +263 71 933 0584: Thank you very much for the session
23/1/24, 4:54 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: You are most welcome!
27/1/24, 9:14 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *Greetings of the day, Delani*
I hope this message finds you in good spirits. I want to share some heartfelt news with you. After careful consideration, I've come to a decision that carries a mix of emotions. *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor.*

As we journey through this moment, I can't help but feel a mix of emotions realizing that our daily interactions are about to change. *Saying goodbye to our current way of connecting brings a bittersweet feeling*, but deep down, I see change as a chance for growth and the discovery of new opportunities.

Reflecting on our shared journey, I am truly humbled by the extraordinary moments we've experienced together—the bonds we've forged, the shared laughter, and the countless instances of mutual growth and learning.
27/1/24, 9:16 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

Thank you for being an integral part of my life's journey. Keep radiating brilliance, dare to dream ambitiously, and always remember the remarkable potential within you. 
*I want to assure you that the mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
27/1/24, 9:34 AM - +263 71 933 0584: Thank you

It would have been easier if the venue was in my city (Bulawayo)
15/2/24, 7:33 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning Delani, I completely understand your sentiment. Last time we had multiple venues. This time, with the increased number of students - a whopping 5000! - it made more sense to opt for a single, larger venue.

Choosing a venue accessible to the majority of students was a key consideration. While I know it might not be as convenient for those in Bulawayo, please know that this decision was made with the aim of ensuring that the event is as inclusive and accessible as possible for all attendees.

Thank you for your understanding and your commitment to making this event a success.

17/2/24, 10:58 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Please ensure that you are present at the venue 30 minutes earlier and are dressed appropriately.
Don't forget to carry your admit card!
