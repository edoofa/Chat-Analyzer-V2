I trust this message finds you well and that your day has been delightful thus far.

You know, my dream has always been to embark on a journey of higher studies, aiming to obtain a PhD in chemistry from abroad. *While this means I must bid farewell as your mentor, Believe me, I am doing so with the conviction that the next individual stepping into this role will be of equal or even greater caliber. I trust they will guide you with the same dedication, enabling you to achieve your dreams.*
17/1/24, 2:53 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I have no doubt that you will continue to make me proud, fostering a bond with your new mentor built on honesty and commitment.

As I pen down this closing message, my heart is filled with gratitude for the journey we've shared. I am confident that the next chapter with your new mentor will be marked by growth, support, and achievements that surpass even our fondest expectations. ❤️

As our team engages with Edoofians and parents at today's meet & greet event in Harare, I couldn't help but notice your absence. We were truly looking forward to connecting with you and your family, and exploring the many growth opportunities that Edoofa offers.

Could you please share why you and your parents couldn't attend?
