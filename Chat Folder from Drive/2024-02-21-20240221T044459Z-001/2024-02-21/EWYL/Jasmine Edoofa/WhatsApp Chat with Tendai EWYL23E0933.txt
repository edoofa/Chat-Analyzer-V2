I trust this message finds you well. With regards to our discussion in the day, I wanted to reach out to you and thank you for prioritizing and expediting the EWYL journey for Tendai. We have already set up the dedicated group for Tendai and are excited about the upcoming opportunities.

Having recently shared a glimpse of our annual Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare, we are eager to ensure that Tendai is well-informed and ready to make the most of this transformative experience. Hence, please provide them with all the necessary details regarding the event today and guide them on how Tendai can commence their EWYL journey seamlessly from this point onward.

While we were having multiple conversations with our students in the past few days for the meet & greet event, we figured that there is a slight confusion in the invitation dates. Hence, I wanted to quickly reach out and ensure that the same is not the case with you.

- As per the invitation, *you* are supposed to attend the event along with your parents on *17th of February* which is tomorrow. 
- If you are recommending any of *your friends(Non Edoofians)* along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for *18th of February(8am/1pm) or 19th  February(1pm)*. They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event.
16/2/24, 3:54 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Please ensure that you are present at the venue 30 minutes earlier and are dressed appropriately.
Don't forget to carry your admit card!
