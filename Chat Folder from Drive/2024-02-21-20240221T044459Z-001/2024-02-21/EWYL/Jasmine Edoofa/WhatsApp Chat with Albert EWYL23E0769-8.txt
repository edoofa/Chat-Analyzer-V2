3/1/24, 1:48 PM - +263 78 585 4209: Good afternoon Ms Jasmine..
I guess it may start by asking my name 😃😃😃
3/1/24, 2:04 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: It's true, the foundation of a wonderful pet-owner relationship might just begin with a simple question, like asking your name. <This message was edited>
3/1/24, 2:05 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Today, I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!

3/1/24, 2:40 PM - +263 78 585 4209: Briefly, its about learning more about the industry which I'm going to enter after the studies as well as connecting with some of the subordinates like human and resource managers ,
3/1/24, 2:41 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Amazing, thanks Albert. I’m happy with your understanding. So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!

Exciting news awaits! We are
orchestrating a spectacular industrial visit - *SLICE Con'24 (Symposium of Leaders, Inventors, and Creators with Edoofa*)🫱🏻‍🫲🏼 from Monday to Wednesday.

15/1/24, 1:00 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good Afternoon Albert_*
Kindly excuse me for the delay in my response. Following the event, I experienced a fever and had to be on bed rest for a couple of days.

Let me share the scoop on *Slice Con'24—it was seriously awesome!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️

29/1/24, 9:14 AM - Sanjana Edoofa: *Good Morning Albert*,
I am thrilled to share some incredible news with you - after careful consideration and discussions about your performance in the EWYL Program, you have been selected to take on *the role of Event Coordinator for Edoofa's upcoming Meet & Greet in Zimbabwe* that is due in a few days! Congratulations on this well-deserved opportunity!🥳

This is no ordinary event; _we are expecting a gathering of 5000 people_, and we believe in your ability to not just meet but exceed the responsibilities that come with this role. ⭐

This role is not mandatory but rather an invitation for you to explore and consider. As one of the Event Coordinators, it's a chance for you to showcase your *leadership skills, problem-solving abilities, and creativity* on a grand scale. Apart from this, you will also have *the golden opportunity to collaborate with Edoofa’s Team, work closely with Mr. Angad Singh*, and contribute significantly to the success of this huge event! 🎯
29/1/24, 9:15 AM - Sanjana Edoofa: I know you must be feeling butterflies in your stomach, along with a lot of questions in your mind. Well, to clear all your doubts regarding this opportunity we have scheduled a video call with all the students who have been given this opportunity *today at 2:30 PM CAT.* If you have any questions or if there's anything you'd like to discuss, please note it down so that it can be addressed over the call. 🚨

Congratulations once again, and let's make this event an unforgettable experience for everyone involved!💯✨

As discussed please join this link for your training call:
http://meet.google.com/ozt-bsay-pdy
30/1/24, 2:07 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Hello, Albert!
I hope you are doing well. I understand you were unable to join the call yesterday due to certain challenges. However, since you have shown enthusiasm for this role and for our event, I thought I'd personally reach out to you and bring you upto speed about the discussion I had yesterday with all the students who have been chosen to become a coordinator along with you. Together, you and your co-Edoofians shall be managing an event that would have a footfall of around *5000 participants*. This will undoubtedly be one of the biggest events you ever attend in your academic or professional life. This is the first time that an event of such scale is being conducted in Zimbabwe. In fact, you'd be surprised to know that we had to really struggle to find a suitable venue for such a big event in all of Harare. 

Now, while I know that it is challenging for you to attend each training session, I would not want you to miss out on the oppurtunity of being a part of this mega event, so please do try and participate in as many training calls and sessions in the upcoming days as you can- there will be a lot to learn!! I look forward to seeing you soon!

16/2/24, 3:04 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Albert!

While we were having multiple conversations with our students in the past few days for the meet & greet event, we figured that there is a slight confusion in the invitation dates. Hence, I wanted to quickly reach out and ensure that the same is not the case with you.

- As per the invitation, *you* are supposed to attend the event along with your parents on *17th of February* which is tomorrow. 
- If you are recommending any of *your friends (Non-Edoofians)* along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for *18th of February (8am/1pm) or 19th  February (1pm)*. They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event.

Don't forget to carry your admit card!

Cannot wait to see you there tomorrow! Hope you're excited too! 😃🕺🏻

As our team engages with Edoofians and parents at today's meet & greet event in Harare, I couldn't help but notice your absence. We were truly looking forward to connecting with you and your family, and exploring the many growth opportunities that Edoofa offers.

Could you please share why you and your parents couldn't attend?
