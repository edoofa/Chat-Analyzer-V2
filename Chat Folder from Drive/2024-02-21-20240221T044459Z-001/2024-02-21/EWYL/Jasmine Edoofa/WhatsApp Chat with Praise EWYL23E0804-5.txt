6/1/24, 7:36 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Good Afternoon my lovely student*_
I wanted to share some exciting news with you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 7:36 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. 

*When we connect on the 12th of January at 7::00 pm,* I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨

*Now, Since it will be a long break, I want you to work hard on the projects and submit 7 applications to me on Thursday.* 
Give it your 100% and I know you can do this. Take care

15/1/24, 1:24 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good Afternoon_*
Kindly excuse me for the delay in my response. Following the event, I experienced a fever and had to be on bed rest for a couple of days.

Let me share the scoop on *Slice Con'24—it was seriously awesome!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️

I trust this message finds you well and that your day has been delightful thus far. 
I hope you recall the times when I encouraged you to pursue your dreams passionately and put in the hard work to see them come to fruition. 🎓

*Today, with a heavy heart yet fortified by courage, I am sharing with you my decision to step back from my role as your mentor.* It is not without sincere consideration, and I want you to know that your growth and success have always been my utmost priority.

You know, my dream has always been to embark on a journey of higher studies, aiming to obtain a PhD in chemistry from abroad. *While this means I must bid farewell as your mentor, Believe me, I am doing so with the conviction that the next individual stepping into this role will be of equal or even greater caliber. I trust they will guide you with the same dedication, enabling you to achieve your dreams.*
17/1/24, 9:57 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I have no doubt that you will continue to make me proud, fostering a bond with your new mentor built on honesty and commitment. 

*The mentorship team will be in touch with you to discuss the plan going forward.*

As I pen down this closing message, my heart is filled with gratitude for the journey we've shared. I am confident that the next chapter with your new mentor will be marked by growth, support, and achievements that surpass even our fondest expectations. ❤️

Wishing you all the best on your continued journey, and I look forward to hearing about your future successes.🫱🏼‍🫲🏾
17/1/24, 10:03 PM - +263 71 231 2849: Good evening Ms Jasmine... I'll  miss you so much Ms Jasmine may you be successful in obtaining the PhD in Chemistry.  I'll continue to make you proud .

- If you are recommending any of *your friends (Non Edoofians)* along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for *18th of February (8am/1pm) or 19th February(1pm)*. They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event.

20/2/24, 2:53 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Praise

The past three days flew by in a whirlwind for Team Edoofa – both for those in India and those in Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. Now that we've had a chance to catch our breath, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success.

Your insights from the event are highly valued, and I'm keen to hear about your experience. Would you be open to sharing your thoughts, including your interest in attending similar events in the future and any suggestions for improvement? Additionally, if you have captured any memorable moments in photos, we would greatly appreciate you sharing them.

Your perspective is crucial, and I also encourage you to discuss the event with your parents and gather their feedback.
20/2/24, 3:11 PM - +263 71 231 2849: Greetings @918982519022 , indeed it was an interesting event . I got to meet my fellow Edoofians for the first time, I actually then got to  see that we are a big family, we are many which is good.  The event didn't take long unnecessarily but it was detailed fully.  I look forward to attending such events in the future.  In the future I suggest that such events should take place in a spacious building where everyone will have places to sit. Unfortunately I didn't carry the phone with me on that day so I didn't capture the great moments.
20/2/24, 3:13 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: That's great, and I have taken note of your suggestions.
