As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on 23 January 2024 to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.
20/1/24, 12:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tinashe!

So, are you ready to join me on this exciting journey? Let's work hard and reach for the stars!🌟
20/1/24, 12:58 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We will have our first session on 23rd January 2024 and I'm thrilled to see your enthusiasm. I'd like to offer you two-time slots to continue our journey. Please select one that works for you:

Monday to Friday, 8:30 AM to 9:30 AM
Monday to Friday, 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM
Let me know which one suits your schedule best.
20/1/24, 12:59 PM - +263 78 555 3504: I am ready ma'am.
20/1/24, 12:59 PM - +263 78 555 3504: The second one will do fine ma'am. Thank you.
20/1/24, 1:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Wonderful, my student! So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
20/1/24, 1:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/1/24, 1:09 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Thank you ma'am, I'm really looking forward to starting the discussions.
20/1/24, 1:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I really like your spirit, Tinashe!
20/1/24, 1:17 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let us connect on Tuesday to move ahead with our journey! I am so excited to have you on board!🚀🤝🏽
20/1/24, 1:31 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Thank you ma'am, we'll talk then.
23/1/24, 1:35 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tinashe!

How are you doing? Are you ready for your session?🚀
23/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Good afternoon ma'am, I'm good thanks and how are you?
23/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Yess, we may begin. 👍🏽
23/1/24, 1:47 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
23/1/24, 1:48 PM - +263 78 555 3504: No ma'am, I do not.
23/1/24, 1:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
23/1/24, 1:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
23/1/24, 2:02 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Okay, I understand now.
23/1/24, 2:05 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
23/1/24, 2:08 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Ohh, okay. I'm grateful to have them on my side.
23/1/24, 2:13 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
23/1/24, 2:15 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Yes, it's very intriguing ma'am.
23/1/24, 2:18 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
23/1/24, 2:18 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 2:21 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Okay, let me get right on it.
23/1/24, 2:38 PM - +263 78 555 3504: I'm done reading ma'am.
23/1/24, 4:10 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let's conclude it here. We will pick up from where we left off tomorrow.

Have a great day ahead! See you soon!
24/1/24, 1:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *_“The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step._”* - Lao Tzu

As we embark on today's session, let's remember that every small effort contributes to significant progress. Let's take that first step together and make the most out of our time. Ready to dive in?
24/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Yes ma'am, let's begin.
24/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Good afternoon.
24/1/24, 1:43 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
24/1/24, 1:46 PM - +263 78 555 3504: I like the part by the founder the most.
24/1/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now, at this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
24/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 78 555 3504: That sounds amazing, I can't wait.
24/1/24, 2:02 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
24/1/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Yes ma'am, I understand fully. Let me get right on it.
24/1/24, 2:13 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
24/1/24, 2:13 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 2:29 PM - +263 78 555 3504: I'm done with this ma'am.
24/1/24, 2:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
24/1/24, 2:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Before we wrap up, here's a quick joke to add a smile to your day:

Why don't scientists trust atoms?

Because they make up everything!

Thank you all for a great session. Remember, laughter is the best medicine. Until next time!🚀
24/1/24, 2:37 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Well, from my understanding, I have to understand the market I'm going to be working at in the future and I have to start preparing for it at an early stage.
I have to familiarise myself with the digital and online mode of working. I would have to meet professionals be it online or via my own connections and setup a working relationship between their organisation and Edoofa.
24/1/24, 2:37 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Haha, good one. 😂

Enjoy the rest of your day.
25/1/24, 1:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tinashe!

Let us begin our session with a fun fact: 

The tongue of a blue whale, the largest animal on Earth, can weigh as much as an elephant. Despite their massive size, blue whales primarily feed on tiny shrimp-like animals called krill, using their enormous tongues to filter them from the water.🐋
25/1/24, 1:56 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Good afternoon ma'am.
Sorry for the delay.


That's quite a fascinating phenomenon.
25/1/24, 1:59 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
25/1/24, 1:59 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Okay ma'am.
25/1/24, 2:05 PM - Ananya Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
25/1/24, 2:08 PM - +263 78 555 3504: I have finished reading the document.
It details how I'm supposed to look for a business to partner up with Edoofa. I'm not supposed to find organisations or businesses that are too big or too small. These preferred business should be student centric, recreational or content centric. I'm also supposed to do a thorough background check on the organisation/business and it's founder as well to see if they meet the desired criteria.
25/1/24, 2:14 PM - Ananya Edoofa: You know what , this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
25/1/24, 2:14 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Thank you very much ma'am.
25/1/24, 2:19 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –
1 –  You can use the following form to share the company details with me
*Company Details for Project 1*

Name of the company:
Website:
Name of the Contact Person:

How did you get in touch with the contact person?
25/1/24, 2:19 PM - Ananya Edoofa: 2, and the fun part- I’m sure you read about Scholarship Credits in the document- so, here’s the opportunity for you to earn Scholarship Credits through Project 1 –

1. If you can set up a Company Call with Edoofa Managers : *$2 per call*
2. If the Company signs an MOU with Edoofa : *$20*
3. If the Company Gives internship/job opportunities to

25/1/24, 2:20 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Okay, thank you. I understand.
25/1/24, 2:24 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *Now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it !
25/1/24, 2:24 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 2:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While concluding our session let me highlight that we will continue our conversation on Monday as we do not have our sessions over the weekend. Also, tomorrow, we won't be having our session as it's Republic Day in India. Wishing you a happy Republic Day! It's a special day when we celebrate the adoption of our constitution. People across the country come together for parades, flag hoisting, and cultural events. Looking forward to catching up with you on Monday! Have a wonderful Republic Day celebration!🇮🇳
25/1/24, 2:34 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Okay. I've finished listening.

29/1/24, 1:41 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Good afternoon!

I'll take a look a bit later, right now I do not have a secure Internet connection.
29/1/24, 1:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
29/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 78 555 3504: For the second project I'm supposed to approach my peers and enlighten them about Edoofa.
I'm supposed to tell them about my experience with Edoofa mainly about my counsellors, the EWYL Program and expenses that come with the program.
Basically, I'm supposed to go out to my peers and try and show them the light that is joining the program.
29/1/24, 1:56 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! ,I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like  to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.
29/1/24, 1:56 PM - Ananya Edoofa: 1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

29/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Okay, noted.
29/1/24, 2:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
29/1/24, 2:04 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Okay, I understand. 👍🏽
29/1/24, 2:07 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
29/1/24, 2:14 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Okay, please do.
29/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
29/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
29/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
29/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
29/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
29/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

29/1/24, 2:24 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Okay, noted ma'am.
29/1/24, 2:25 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let us connect tomorrow at the same time. 

Have a good day ahead!🚀
29/1/24, 2:25 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Same to you.
30/1/24, 1:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tinashe!

How are you doing? Did you know that the longest river in the world is the Nile River in Africa, stretching over 6,650 kilometers (4,130 miles)?🤔
30/1/24, 2:23 PM - +263 77 280 6683: Good afternoon ma'am. Tinashe cannot attend the session today. We do not have power at home. I'm at work right now
30/1/24, 2:35 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, thank you for informing me.
31/1/24, 1:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tinashe!

How are you doing? Are you ready to begin our session?🚀
31/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Good afternoon ma'am. I'm fine thanks and how are you?
31/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Yes, we may begin.
31/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, in order to move ahead with your second project, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
31/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
31/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:
31/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
31/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready.

Every day you have to come and say "I am a proud EDOOFIAN' on the EWYL line.
It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, "I am a proud Edoofian.
2/2/24, 2:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: As we plan for our sessions, you have the flexibility to choose between the following options:

Option 1: Monday and Thursday
Option 2: Tuesday and Friday
Feel free to select the days that best suit your schedule. Following your decision, I will provide you with an updated timetable.

Additionally, every Wednesday, I will share a piece of Wednesday wisdom, and we can discuss it in our subsequent session. Similarly, every Saturday, you will receive your weekend activity, and we will review it in our next session. Both of these components are essential for your evaluation and progress, so ensure their completion.

It's crucial to note that you will only receive your lessons and activities if you follow your EWYL (Every Week, Your Life) ritual consistently. Make it a daily practice, especially in the morning, to ensure timely sharing of activities and lessons.
2/2/24, 2:51 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Noted ma'am. I will do as you asked.
2/2/24, 2:52 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Option 2 is the best in my eyes.

It was a fun and informative experience really. It had me excited to go to India and all.

I enjoyed watching Mr Singh's presentation, most notably the SLICE Con' video. Seeing other students interact with each other and the CEOs of big companies was really inspiring.
