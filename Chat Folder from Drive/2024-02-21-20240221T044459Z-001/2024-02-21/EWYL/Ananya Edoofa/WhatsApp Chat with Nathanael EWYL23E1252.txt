12/2/24, 8:59 AM - +263 77 302 0949: I am Nathanael Maoneke the son of Innocent and Ruth Maoneke. I completed my O level and A Level studies in 2013 and 2015 respectively and then my Honours Degree in Accounting in 2021. For my strengths i do say i am problem solver, a motivator, a natural leader and have the ability to perform under pressure. For my weakness i can say i work hard most of my time and forget that i have a social life .We are five in our family our parents are both teachers and the second born is working  in the Uk and the last born is still doing her O level studies. I would like to study for a master in Accounting and my parents would be financing for the studies . We stay in Harare province. My hobbies are playing basketball, soccer and dance. My short term goal is completing my masters program and get employed whereas my long term goal is to open an accounting firm and be the bridge of those in need. My passion is having a helping to the less privileged so that we can have equal opportunities
12/2/24, 9:03 AM - Ananya Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear about your academic achievements and aspirations. Your dedication to your studies and your desire to pursue a master's degree in Accounting is commendable. With your strengths as a problem solver, motivator, and natural leader, I'm sure you'll excel in your chosen field.

It's important to strike a balance between work and social life, so being aware of your tendency to prioritize work is a good step. Remember to take time for yourself and enjoy your hobbies, such as playing basketball, soccer, and dance.

Your short-term goal of completing your master's program and finding employment aligns well with your long-term goal of opening an accounting firm and helping those in need. It's inspiring to see your passion for making a difference in the lives of others and promoting equal opportunities.

With the support of your family and your own determination, I have no doubt that you will achieve great success in your future endeavors. Best of luck with your master's studies and your future career in accounting!
12/2/24, 9:10 AM - +263 77 302 0949: thank you
12/2/24, 9:11 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
12/2/24, 9:14 AM - +263 77 302 0949: encouragement on future financial plans and future study options
12/2/24, 9:16 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Lovely! Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
12/2/24, 9:16 AM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
12/2/24, 9:21 AM - +263 77 302 0949: thats great
12/2/24, 9:22 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
12/2/24, 9:27 AM - +263 77 302 0949: it will be nice meeting them
12/2/24, 9:29 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
12/2/24, 9:32 AM - +263 77 302 0949: very interesting
12/2/24, 9:36 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
12/2/24, 9:36 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/2/24, 9:46 AM - +263 77 302 0949: very inspirational
12/2/24, 9:46 AM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
12/2/24, 9:49 AM - +263 77 302 0949: thats exactly what i also feel . it gives a person the zeal to know more
12/2/24, 9:54 AM - Ananya Edoofa: It's been wonderful getting to know you and having you here. I wish we could have connected for a longer time. However, since our session time is over, let's connect tomorrow at the same time. Have a good day!🌟

These remarkable birds travel up to 71,000 kilometers (44,000 miles) round trip every year from their breeding grounds in the Arctic to their wintering grounds in Antarctica and back again.
