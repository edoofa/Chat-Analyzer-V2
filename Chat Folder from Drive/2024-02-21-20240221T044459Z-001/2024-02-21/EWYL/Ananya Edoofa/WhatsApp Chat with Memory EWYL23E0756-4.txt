7/1/24, 8:45 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called SLICE CON' 24 for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝

It has been observed that you have not been attending your sessions lately, nor following your EWYL ritual.

You know, we specifically allocate slots and time for you, and your non-attendance is truly disappointing and demotivating.

If you are facing any challenges, please let me know so that I can assist you. If you do not share it with me, how would I be able to help you?

Memory, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it's going to be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes proper time and effort, our team will be occupied so tight. Therefore, I was thinking of connecting only once a week for the time being.

Therefore, your new session timing will be *Every Tuesday, 9:30 a.m*. ⏰

Can't wait for this adventure together, see you tomorrow! 🚀

I have some exciting news to share with you. Tomorrow, we are going to celebrate Republic Day! Now, let me tell you a bit about it.

Republic Day is a special day in India. It's a time when we remember and celebrate the day our country adopted its Constitution. Just like a constitution helps guide a country, ours outlines the rules and principles that make India the diverse and vibrant place it is.

On Republic Day, we have a big parade in the capital city, where people from all over the country come together to showcase our culture, traditions, and achievements. It's like a colorful and lively show with music, dance, and different displays. The Indian flag is hoisted, and everyone sings the national anthem with pride.

People also fly kites, dress up in traditional clothes, and enjoy delicious food! 🇮🇳✨

Your name is shining bright, and I can't wait for you to listen in on the great news.

So, go, play, and get ready for a burst of positivity coming your way! 🚀
27/1/24, 12:43 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

27/1/24, 3:05 PM - Ananya Edoofa: A few of my students have classes scheduled for 1:30 PM, and I believe moving our call to 2:30 PM would accommodate everyone's schedule more effectively. So, let us connect at 2:30 PM.
27/1/24, 4:11 PM - +263 78 220 4972: Noted Ma'am

30/1/24, 1:34 PM - +263 78 220 4972: Afternoon Ma'am I'm still waiting for the update
30/1/24, 3:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I understand you were unable to join the call yesterday due to certain challenges. However, since you have shown enthusiasm for this role and for our event, I thought I'd personally reach out to you and bring you upto speed about the discussion I had yesterday with all the students who have been chosen to become a coordinator along with you. Together, you and your co-Edoofians shall be managing an event that would have a footfall of around *5000 participants*. This will undoubtedly be one of the biggest events you ever attend in your academic or professional life. This is the first time that an event of such scale is being conducted in Zimbabwe. In fact, you'd be surprised to know that we had to really struggle to find a suitable venue for such a big event in all of Harare. 

Now, while I know that it is challenging for you to attend each training session, I would not want you to miss out on the oppurtunity of being a part of this mega event, so please do try and participate in as many training calls and sessions in the upcoming days as you can- there will be a lot to learn!! I look forward to seeing you soon!
30/1/24, 4:45 PM - +263 78 220 4972: Thank you Ma'am so when are we conducting the next meeting or the next training call
31/1/24, 8:16 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Memory!

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to confirm our scheduled training call today at 2:30 PM.

In case you anticipate any network challenges, I recommend preparing a hotspot or having an alternative device on hand. This precautionary measure will ensure a smoother communication experience and make our efforts during the call more productive. See you!
31/1/24, 8:50 AM - +263 77 339 0549: Morning Ms Ananya. I am Memory's father. I think Memory needs an orientation on the use of Google meet. I want to assume that could be one challenge she could be facing. Network issues are real though. Maybe you could also send her audios of the call in case she misses again.
