7/1/24, 8:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called SLICE CON' 24 for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
7/1/24, 8:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the 8th, 9th, and 10th of January, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨

It has been observed that you have not been attending your sessions lately, nor following your EWYL ritual.

18/1/24, 9:41 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Rangarirai!

24/1/24, 10:39 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *_🌟 URGENT UPDATE 🌟_*

Rangarirai, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

In light of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. *As of now, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable* and I am confident that together, we will create something truly extraordinary.

I have some exciting news to share with you. Tomorrow, we are going to celebrate Republic Day! Now, let me tell you a bit about it.

Republic Day is a special day in India. It's a time when we remember and celebrate the day our country adopted its Constitution. Just like a constitution helps guide a country, ours outlines the rules and principles that make India the diverse and vibrant place it is.

On Republic Day, we have a big parade in the capital city, where people from all over the country come together to showcase our culture, traditions, and achievements. It's like a colorful and lively show with music, dance, and different displays. The Indian flag is hoisted, and everyone sings the national anthem with pride.

People also fly kites, dress up in traditional clothes, and enjoy delicious food! 🇮🇳✨

I have been expecting to hear from you for the past couple of days, but I can see you have not been able to get back to me for certain reasons I am unaware of.

Most of my students have already quite enthusiastically reserved seats for themselves and their family and friends.
