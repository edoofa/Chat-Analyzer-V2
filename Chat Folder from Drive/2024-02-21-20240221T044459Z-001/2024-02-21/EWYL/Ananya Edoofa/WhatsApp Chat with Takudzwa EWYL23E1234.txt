While I understand and appreciate that you are working to finance your education, you must finish your EWYL orientation with me, as mentioned earlier. If you are not able to do that, you can ask your parents to attend the session with me and understand the basics of the program.

This will ensure a smooth process, and we can later connect on the projects only. Please let me know if you proceed in this manner.

Let us begin our session with an amazing fact! 

_Did you know that the Arctic Tern holds the record for the longest migration journey of any animal? These remarkable birds travel up to 71,000 kilometers (44,000 miles) round trip every year from their breeding grounds in the Arctic to their wintering grounds in Antarctica and back again. It's an astonishing feat of endurance and navigation!_🐦

17/2/24, 9:46 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning,Takudzwa!

I hope this message finds you well. I apologize for not being able to connect with you yesterday. Unfortunately, I experienced a technical glitch that prevented me from accessing my WhatsApp account. I've managed to restore it this morning.
17/2/24, 9:46 AM - Ananya Edoofa: 🚨_*URGENT UPDATE*_🚨

While we were having multiple conversations with our students in the past few days for the meet & greet event, we figured that there was a slight confusion in the invitation dates. So, I am reaching out to make sure that the same is not the case with you.

* As per the invitation, *you* are supposed to attend the event along with your parents on *the 19th of February* which is on Monday. 
* If you are recommending any of *your friends(Non-Edoofians)* along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for *the 18th of February(8am/1pm) or 19th  February(1pm)*. They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event.
17/2/24, 12:34 PM - +263 78 589 4003: Hello ma'am the invitation was written 8.00AM and it required that students report 30 minutes in advance so the event is scheduled for the afternoon?
17/2/24, 12:35 PM - +263 78 589 4003: Or 1.00 PM is for the non-edoofians
17/2/24, 12:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/2/24, 1:17 PM - +263 78 589 4003: Okay ma'am noted thank you very much
18/2/24, 11:06 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good Morning, Takudzwa

18/2/24, 9:04 PM - +263 78 589 4003: Hello ma'am I'm glad to be awaiting the tomorrow event. But it's very unfortunate that both of my parents being teachers they are both sports organisers at their schools, it's an incredible coincidence but very unfortunate though because they are to attend sports camping with their students
18/2/24, 9:05 PM - +263 78 589 4003: So I would like to know whether it's still okay for me to come along on my own ma'am
20/2/24, 1:17 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Takudzwa!

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect earlier, I was a bit occupied in preparations and planning.
20/2/24, 1:18 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, did you manage to attend the event?
20/2/24, 6:21 PM - +263 78 589 4003: Hello ma'am it all went well I attended ma'am. We are waiting for the outcomes on 26 Feb
