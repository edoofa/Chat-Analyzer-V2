9/2/24, 1:42 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
9/2/24, 1:55 PM - +260 96 8635206: Great
9/2/24, 1:58 PM - +260 96 8635206: Wonderful
9/2/24, 2:17 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?
9/2/24, 2:24 PM - +260 96 8635206: Well, My name is Esau Ackson Zulu, a 17-year-old from the vibrant nation of Zambia. With a zest for soccer matches and a penchant for delving into the pages  of books, I find joy in both the thrill of the game and the depths of knowledge found within literature. However, beyond my hobbies lies a burning passion and unwavering goal: to become an electrical engineer.

Fueled by curiosity and a desire to make a tangible difference, I envision a future where I contribute to Zambia's development through innovative electrical engineering solutions. With each goal scored on the soccer field and each chapter turned in a book, I am reminded of the perseverance and dedication required to achieve my aspirations.

As I embark on this journey, I am excited to embrace challenges, seize opportunities, and ultimately, leave a lasting impact on my community and country. With determination as my compass and knowledge as my guiding light, I am  aspiring to become an electrical engineer, ready to make waves in the world of engineering and beyond.
9/2/24, 2:39 PM - Ananya Edoofa: It's great to meet you! Your passion for both chess and netball sounds exciting. They're both fantastic ways to challenge yourself mentally and physically while having fun. Pursuing a career in law is a commendable goal, and I'm sure with your dedication and determination, you'll achieve great success. Your aspiration to help others in need speaks volumes about your character, and I have no doubt you'll make a positive impact in whatever path you choose. Keep striving for your dreams, and never hesitate to reach out if you need support along the way. Wishing you all the best on your journey!
9/2/24, 2:47 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
9/2/24, 3:10 PM - +260 96 8635206: Sorry madam but I think this message wasn't meant for me, because I mentioned soccer and electrical engineering  not netball, chess and law
9/2/24, 3:10 PM - +260 96 8635206: Happy weekend to you too
12/2/24, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Zulu!

How was your weekend? Are you ready for your session?🚀
12/2/24, 2:04 PM - +260 96 8635206: Yes madam
12/2/24, 2:09 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Zulu, why are you late?
12/2/24, 2:21 PM - +260 96 8635206: Sorry madam the network here is a bit poor
12/2/24, 2:22 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright. Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
12/2/24, 2:24 PM - +260 96 8635206: Yes madam
12/2/24, 2:25 PM - +260 96 8635206: But it would be good if you kindly go through them again
12/2/24, 2:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I wish we could have connected for a longer time. However, since our session time is over, let's connect tomorrow at the same time. Have a good day!🌟
12/2/24, 2:30 PM - +260 96 8635206: Alright madam have a good day
13/2/24, 1:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Zulu!

I have observed that you have not been texting me at your session timings; it has always been me who drops a reminder message at your session time. Has your teacher ever dropped a reminder message to you before the class?
13/2/24, 1:53 PM - +260 96 8635206: No madam
13/2/24, 1:57 PM - +260 96 8635206: Sorry for the late responses but we may now begin madam
13/2/24, 2:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: That's alright, however now that our session time is over, let us connect tomorrow at the same time. Have a good day ahead!🚀
13/2/24, 2:41 PM - +260 96 8635206: Alright madam have a good day too
14/2/24, 1:31 PM - +260 96 8635206: Good afternoon madam I ready for the lesson
14/2/24, 1:41 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Zulu!

How are you doing? Are you ready for the session?🚀
14/2/24, 1:42 PM - +260 96 8635206: I'm alright and yourself madam?
14/2/24, 1:42 PM - +260 96 8635206: And im very ready for the session madam
14/2/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! So,  Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
14/2/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
14/2/24, 1:53 PM - +260 96 8635206: Understood
14/2/24, 2:02 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
14/2/24, 2:16 PM - +260 96 8635206: Alright madam
14/2/24, 2:18 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
14/2/24, 2:19 PM - +260 96 8635206: Very much actually
14/2/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
14/2/24, 2:21 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/2/24, 2:39 PM - +260 96 8635206: This is amazing
14/2/24, 2:39 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let us connect in our next session which is tomorrow at the same time. See you!🚀
14/2/24, 2:39 PM - +260 96 8635206: Alright madam have a good day
16/2/24, 1:43 PM - +260 96 8635206: Good afternoon madam
