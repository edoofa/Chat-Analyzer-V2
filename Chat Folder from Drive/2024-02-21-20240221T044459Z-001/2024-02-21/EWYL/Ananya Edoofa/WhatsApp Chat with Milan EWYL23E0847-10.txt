22/12/23, 2:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now since our session time is over, let us conclude it here and connect on Monday as we do not have our sessions over the weekend.
23/12/23, 1:45 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Milan!

I really hope that your Christmas went well. Let's discuss how we celebrated our Christmas this year in our session! Come on, join your EWYL Line, and let's talk about our celebration!
26/12/23, 2:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I was so excited to talk to you about the Christmas celebrations, however, you did not show up! May I ask if you are facing any challenges?
27/12/23, 1:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Milan! What did one wall say to the other wall?

I'll meet you at the corner!' Now that we've built a little humor, let's construct some great ideas in today's session.😄
27/12/23, 1:36 PM - +263 77 821 3898: Heyy ... Good Afternoon Ms Ananya
27/12/23, 1:58 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, in order to move ahead with your second project, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
27/12/23, 1:58 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

27/12/23, 1:58 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:
27/12/23, 1:58 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
27/12/23, 1:58 PM - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
27/12/23, 1:58 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
27/12/23, 1:58 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
27/12/23, 1:58 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.

6/1/24, 1:35 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Milan!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:35 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
6/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 77 821 3898: Splendid, although I wish I was there 🙂
6/1/24, 1:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Aww, don't worry Milan! We will have this every year!
6/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 77 821 3898: Great! 😊
11/1/24, 1:39 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Milan!

Before beginning our session, I want to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that took place over the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! It was so happening, and I am delighted to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only that, but we also hosted various industrial leaders, and it went exceptionally well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech Made Easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.

17/1/24, 8:37 AM - +263 77 821 3898: I was wondering if we could adjust our session time a little bit <This message was edited>
17/1/24, 8:39 AM - +263 77 821 3898: I'll pitch my idea 💡

I thought we keep it at the same period *1:30pm to 2:30pm CAT* but the days are getting tricky so thought if we did our sessions on 

Monday
Wednesday and
Friday 

Tuesday and Thursday I'm really packed and I might not be available for my sessions from time to time! <This message was edited>

Warm greetings from India! While we would like to believe you might be dreaming of visiting us soon, we couldn't wait any longer to meet you! That's why we're thrilled to announce the special, annual and exclusive Africa Meet & Greet 2024, where our Founder Mr Angad Singh along with Senior Counsellors, Admission Officers, EWYL Mentors and other members of Team Edoofa is flying all the way from India to Zimbabwe just to meet you! ✈️😄 This exciting one-day event will be packed with valuable insights. You'll gain practical knowledge through seminars and sessions by industry experts, and be inspired by real-life experiences from your seniors who are already thriving in India thanks to Edoofa. Picture this: An amazing day filled with knowledge, connection, and the chance to meet the Edoofa team face-to-face! We would be delighted to welcome you and your family to this exclusive event. This is a great oppurtunity for you to educate yourself about the employment oppurtunities after graduation in the ever growing global market. You would also be able to get a sneak peak into the life on an Edoofian through the lens of your seniors🌍.
