16/1/24, 2:21 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
]
16/1/24, 2:22 PM - +263 77 372 3003: No please elaborate
16/1/24, 2:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
16/1/24, 2:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
16/1/24, 2:25 PM - +263 77 372 3003: Okay noted
16/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
16/1/24, 2:27 PM - +263 77 372 3003: Noted and thankyou
16/1/24, 2:27 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
16/1/24, 2:28 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 2:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let us conclude our session here, and remember, every effort you put in is a step closer to success. Keep participating, stay motivated, and earn those credits! You're all doing great, and I look forward to our continued journey together. See you next time!ac
16/1/24, 2:33 PM - +263 77 372 3003: Okay noted and thankyou!
17/1/24, 1:36 PM - +263 77 372 3003: Afternoon everyone!
18/1/24, 1:29 PM - +263 77 372 3003: Good Afternoon, everyone!
18/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Prosper!

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you yesterday. Unfortunately, due to bad health, I had to take a day off.
18/1/24, 1:32 PM - +263 77 372 3003: Okay noted
18/1/24, 1:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
18/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 77 372 3003: Edoofa hall of inspiration
18/1/24, 1:42 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
18/1/24, 1:43 PM - +263 77 372 3003: Yes it is
18/1/24, 1:44 PM - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Prosper?
18/1/24, 1:46 PM - +263 77 372 3003: It sounds great
18/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 77 372 3003: They are also great goals
18/1/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing, We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
18/1/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 1:56 PM - +263 77 372 3003: Yes
18/1/24, 1:58 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
18/1/24, 2:20 PM - +263 77 372 3003: I'm done
18/1/24, 2:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let's connect tomorrow at the same time. Meanwhile, I'd like you to share your understanding of the document before our next session. See you!
18/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 77 372 3003: Okay from what l read l understood that as Edoofans we have 3 projects to do as part of our EWYL program. The first one is to identify companies or organisations for example the one's that bases on education and gather information about the company that is it's number of workers using  and recruit them in having a contract with Edoofa so as to help other students with potentials in having good education as well as helping students acquire business skills needed in future.

The second activity is to recruit other youths of my age who have graduated in their secondary education either recently or have 6months. The aim is to tell them about the vision of Edoofa and help them get the opportunity of achieving their dreams of gaining or acquiring higher education with the help of Edoofa. Lastly we have to make a list of schools surrounding us in our places and approach them so as to tell them about Edoofa. By doing so will be having the aim of making them have a partnership with Edoofa so as to help other students with greater potentials.
18/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 77 372 3003: Okay noted
18/1/24, 2:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great job!
18/1/24, 2:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 2:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let's connect tomorrow at the same time. Meanwhile, I'd like you to share your understanding of the document before our next session. See you!
18/1/24, 2:31 PM - +263 77 372 3003: Okay noted
19/1/24, 1:30 PM - +263 77 372 3003: Good afternoon everyone!
19/1/24, 1:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Prosper!

19/1/24, 1:40 PM - +263 77 372 3003: That is a great way of motivation and inspiration
19/1/24, 1:45 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Have you gone through the audio?
19/1/24, 1:46 PM - +263 77 372 3003: Yes ma'am
19/1/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
19/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 77 372 3003: We what we call the cooperate alliance which helps us understand our fields of work as we have connect with companies that are technologically driven using an app known as LinkedIn which  shows different types of companies and their profiles. After identification of such companies we have to interact with the decision makers and set a meeting with them so that can connect with team Edoofa for more information. The company must also have  25-30 members according to the requirements.
19/1/24, 2:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing, thanks. I’m happy with your understanding.
19/1/24, 2:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds.

19/1/24, 2:04 PM - Ananya Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
19/1/24, 2:22 PM - +263 77 372 3003: When searching for such companies we have to consider factors such as nature of the company that is is it student centric or recreation. We also have to consider scale of the company that is it's number of people ranging from (50-200) and above or its financial status. We also consider the founders background that is his achievements and also the mission of the company
19/1/24, 2:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: You know what, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
19/1/24, 2:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 1:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Prosper!

*_Did you know that a group of flamingos is called a 'flamboyance.' So, just like the flamboyance of flamingos, let's add a touch of flair to our session today._*

Ready to soar into the world of curiosity?🦩
22/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 77 372 3003: Good Afternoon everyone

22/1/24, 1:46 PM - +263 77 372 3003: Okay l understood that the community building project is also part of my project for EWYL. I will have to consult my friends and other youths of my age with potential when it comes to academics, and tell them about the Edoofa program. If they are serious enough and want to pursue their education abroad, then l will have to tell them about the expenses, the EWYL program and also the motive of the Edoofa program so as to help them understand before them applying.
22/1/24, 1:54 PM - Ananya Edoofa: 1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

22/1/24, 1:58 PM - +263 77 372 3003: Okay thankyou ma'am
22/1/24, 2:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
22/1/24, 2:03 PM - +263 77 372 3003: Okay noted
22/1/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
22/1/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
22/1/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
22/1/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
22/1/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
22/1/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
22/1/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

22/1/24, 2:10 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, in order to move ahead with your second project, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
22/1/24, 2:10 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

22/1/24, 2:10 PM - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
22/1/24, 2:10 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
22/1/24, 2:10 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
22/1/24, 2:10 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.

Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
24/1/24, 2:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'

Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

Because of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. *As of now, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable*. Meanwhile, you can keep working on your targets and keep me posted on your EWYL group.
24/1/24, 2:33 PM - +263 77 372 3003: Okay ma'am
24/1/24, 2:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Before we wrap up, here's a quick joke to add a smile to your day:

Let us begin our session with a fun fact: 

The tongue of a blue whale, the largest animal on Earth, can weigh as much as an elephant. Despite their massive size, blue whales primarily feed on tiny shrimp-like animals called krill, using their enormous tongues to filter them from the water.🐋
