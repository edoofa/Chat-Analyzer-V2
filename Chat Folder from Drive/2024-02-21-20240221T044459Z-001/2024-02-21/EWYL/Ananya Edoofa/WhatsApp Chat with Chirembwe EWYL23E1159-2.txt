I hope you're all ready for a great session. Let's kick things off with a quick joke to lighten the mood:

Why did the math book look sad? Well, because it had too many problems! 😄
16/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 77 255 1097: 🤣🤣🤣🤣That is funny
16/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 77 255 1097: Im ready

18/1/24, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Chirembwe

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you yesterday. Unfortunately, due to bad health, I had to take a day off.
18/1/24, 2:38 PM - +263 77 255 1097: It's OK l understand and I'm sorry for late reply my phone was dead <This message was edited>
19/1/24, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Chirembwe
Before beginning today's session, I want you to check out this incredible post :

https://www.instagram.com/p/CzVl_ADBbbz/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA== <This message was edited>
19/1/24, 1:38 PM - +263 77 255 1097: Good afternoon let me check
19/1/24, 1:43 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Moving ahead, let us discuss the goals and objectives of the EWYL program! So, the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals. <This message was edited>
19/1/24, 1:43 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
19/1/24, 1:44 PM - +263 77 255 1097: Thank you for sharing
19/1/24, 1:49 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
19/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 77 255 1097: Okay noted
19/1/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
19/1/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 77 255 1097: OK noted

19/1/24, 2:09 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
19/1/24, 2:10 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 2:11 PM - +263 77 255 1097: I think all 7 parts I like them
19/1/24, 2:14 PM - +263 77 255 1097: Thank you for sharing it is inspiring
19/1/24, 2:18 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great!  At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
19/1/24, 2:20 PM - +263 77 255 1097: It sounds great
19/1/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
19/1/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, share your understanding of this document with me before our next session. 

Let's connect on Monday since we don't have sessions over the weekend. Happy Weekend! 🚀
19/1/24, 2:21 PM - +263 77 255 1097: Yes it is clear
19/1/24, 2:21 PM - +263 77 255 1097: Thank you
22/1/24, 10:50 AM - +263 77 255 1097: The second project I understand it the first one is a bit complicated for me if u don't mind to clarify on the first project
22/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Chirembwe!

Let us begin our session with an interesting fact!

Due to the pandemic the world has moved online so l have to talk to different managers like HRs fo the technology related company or organization I choose and I have to take their phone number to arrange a meeting with Endoofa team
22/1/24, 2:09 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing work. Chirembwe! 🤝🏽

22/1/24, 2:21 PM - +263 77 255 1097: The document is just emphasizing on how to search for the company I'm looking for. In order to do that I have to follow the 6 stages in the guide. These stages can help me in looking for the right company in an efficient manner
22/1/24, 2:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: You know what, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
22/1/24, 2:24 PM - +263 77 255 1097: Thank you
22/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Before we wrap up today's session, I want to leave you with a burst of motivation. Remember, each effort you put into our project is like planting a seed. Nurture it with dedication, watch it grow with collaboration, and soon you'll reap the rewards in the form of credits. Let's bring our collective brilliance to this project and make it shine. 

Together, there's no limit to what we can achieve. Let's go out there, give it our all, and earn those well-deserved credits! Until our next meeting, stay inspired and keep rocking!
22/1/24, 2:27 PM - +263 77 255 1097: Wise words thank you

As we embark on today's session, let's remember that every small effort contributes to significant progress. Let's take that first step together and make the most out of our time. Ready to dive in?
24/1/24, 1:38 PM - +263 73 398 2320: Good afternoon

I'm ready
24/1/24, 1:44 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, today I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
24/1/24, 1:44 PM - +263 73 398 2320: OK
24/1/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
24/1/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
24/1/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
24/1/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
24/1/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
24/1/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

24/1/24, 1:55 PM - +263 73 398 2320: Oky noted
24/1/24, 2:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, in order to move ahead with your second project, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
24/1/24, 2:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

24/1/24, 2:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:
24/1/24, 2:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
24/1/24, 2:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉

24/1/24, 2:07 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, it’s been an interesting conversation with you so far. However, I have some cool things left to share and thus, I think we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
24/1/24, 2:07 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 2:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Before we wrap up, here's a quick joke to add a smile to your day:

Why don't scientists trust atoms?

Because they make up everything!

25/1/24, 1:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Chirembwe!

Let us begin our session with a fun fact: 

The tongue of a blue whale, the largest animal on Earth, can weigh as much as an elephant. Despite their massive size, blue whales primarily feed on tiny shrimp-like animals called krill, using their enormous tongues to filter them from the water.🐋
25/1/24, 2:06 PM - +263 73 398 2320: Good afternoon

25/1/24, 2:19 PM - +263 73 398 2320: In this project I am tasked to consult local schools to meet headmasters, principal etc and tell them about the endoofa program and how it is helping me and how it can be helpful to the school students of the local schools. I also have to take their phone numbers to arrange a meeting with endoofa team
25/1/24, 2:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay great, now allow me to recap this project quickly for you in 2 steps:

​​
25/1/24, 2:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: After that, you will share in details about the program with the principals and ask them if you can schedule a call with the Edooa program Director so that the students of their school can also achieve the same.
25/1/24, 2:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: After the school authorities respond to your message and you can set up our meeting with them, you can ask them about the date and the time when they would be available. Once you get that information, you can send me the school details and the time and date of the meeting via this form.

29/1/24, 1:54 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Let me help you with the kind of communication that you should do with the school heads, okay?



Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:
Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
29/1/24, 1:55 PM - +263 73 398 2320: Oky I understand
29/1/24, 1:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 1:58 PM - +263 73 398 2320: Ok
29/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 73 398 2320: Q1. Mabvuku High School and it is not connected with Endoofa

Q2. I will tell the head master about Endoofa program and how it helps students to study abroad

Q3. Harare Province
29/1/24, 2:05 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Well, as per our records, your school is not connected with us. And Voila! You can therefore connect with your own school and earn credits at an initial stage!
29/1/24, 2:05 PM - +263 73 398 2320: OK noted
29/1/24, 2:08 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 2:08 PM - +263 73 398 2320: Sorry can you please come again <This message was edited>
29/1/24, 2:13 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 2:14 PM - +263 73 398 2320: Right now I don't have but I will go and get it tomorrow
29/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright!I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him/her for your School Head’s Contact.
29/1/24, 2:17 PM - +263 73 398 2320: Yea I just did that and I got the contact
29/1/24, 2:17 PM - +263 73 398 2320: Mr Mbirimi.vcf (file attached)
29/1/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
29/1/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
29/1/24, 2:21 PM - +263 73 398 2320: OK I promise
29/1/24, 2:25 PM - Ananya Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_

Greetings Mr./Mrs *School Head Name*!
Hope you are doing well.

I am *Your Name* and I am a beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
I stand obliged to get an opportunity to connect with you, I hope to have a result/conclusion-driven conversation with you today.

May I know at what time you will be available to connect via Whatsapp?
29/1/24, 2:25 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let us connect tomorrow at the same time. 

Have a good day ahead!🚀
29/1/24, 2:26 PM - +263 73 398 2320: Thank you

31/1/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that we will be beginning our new journey. From now onwards we will be having our session on a dedicated EWYL Line. Please save the EWYL Line contact number: +91 98107 89170.

Every day you have to come and say "I am a proud EDOOFIAN' on the EWYL line.
It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, "I am a proud Edoofian.
31/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 73 398 2320: Oky noted
31/1/24, 2:08 PM - Ananya Edoofa: As we plan for our sessions, you have the flexibility to choose between the following options:

Option 1: Monday and Thursday
Option 2: Tuesday and Friday
Feel free to select the days that best suit your schedule. Following your decision, I will provide you with an updated timetable.

Additionally, every Wednesday, I will share a piece of Wednesday wisdom, and we can discuss it in our subsequent session. Similarly, every Saturday, you will receive your weekend activity, and we will review it in our next session. Both of these components are essential for your evaluation and progress, so ensure their completion.

It's crucial to note that you will only receive your lessons and activities if you follow your EWYL (Every Week, Your Life) ritual consistently. Make it a daily practice, especially in the morning, to ensure timely sharing of activities and lessons.
31/1/24, 2:13 PM - +263 73 398 2320: I choose option 1
31/1/24, 2:15 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright! Now, I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:
