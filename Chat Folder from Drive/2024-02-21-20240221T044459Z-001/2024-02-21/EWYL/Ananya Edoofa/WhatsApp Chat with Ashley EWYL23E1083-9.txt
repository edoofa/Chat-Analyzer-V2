I was involved in a call with my students who will be presenting to prominent CEOs and entrepreneurs during a significant industrial visit scheduled for next week. Training them is crucial, especially since it's their first time participating in such an event.

As a result, I had to end our session earlier. We will reconnect in our next session, which is on Monday, as we do not hold sessions over the weekend. Wishing you a happy weekend!
5/1/24, 4:36 PM - +263 71 656 7965: Its okay ma'am and thank you again have a nice weekend too
6/1/24, 1:26 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Ashley!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:26 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
7/1/24, 9:04 AM - +263 71 656 7965: Okay ma'am its fine wish you the best
11/1/24, 11:26 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Ashley!

I hope you are doing well. Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you this morning. Actually, I was sorting out some pictures and videos for you. Let us do one thing, for today let us connect today at 1:30 pm and I will share a lot about our three-day event!

Is that alright?
11/1/24, 11:30 AM - +263 71 656 7965: Morning ma'am how are you, iam fine with the schedule its alright
11/1/24, 1:49 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Before beginning our session, I want to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that took place over the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! It was so happening, and I am delighted to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only that, but we also hosted various industrial leaders, and it went exceptionally well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech Made Easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.
11/1/24, 1:52 PM - +263 71 656 7965: Okay that's impressive to hear ma'am
11/1/24, 1:55 PM - +263 71 656 7965: I'm glad you did had a great time

11/1/24, 2:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
11/1/24, 2:25 PM - +263 71 656 7965: Yes a little bit ma'am but not really
11/1/24, 2:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
11/1/24, 2:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
11/1/24, 2:32 PM - +263 71 656 7965: Okay ma'am its all clear now
11/1/24, 2:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*.

Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
11/1/24, 2:47 PM - +263 71 656 7965: Thank you ma'am, that would be nice to be intact with them
11/1/24, 2:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, since our session time is over, we shall connect in our next session.

I hope you're all ready for a great session. Let's kick things off with a quick joke to lighten the mood:

16/1/24, 8:33 AM - +263 71 656 7965: 😃im okay ma'am and ready for the session
16/1/24, 8:43 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.

16/1/24, 8:47 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
16/1/24, 8:49 AM - +263 71 656 7965: Yes ma'am, Completely interesting
16/1/24, 8:54 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
16/1/24, 8:54 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 8:58 AM - +263 71 656 7965: Okay let me go through it

16/1/24, 9:17 AM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
16/1/24, 9:21 AM - +263 71 656 7965: I liked the whole section especially when Mr Anhad said the way to align yourself with your environment is to design your environment to work for you instead of against you,which a big lesson
16/1/24, 9:22 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing! At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
16/1/24, 9:26 AM - +263 71 656 7965: This sound perfectly amazing, and  wonderful ma'am
16/1/24, 9:31 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright! Now that our session time is over, let us connect tomorrow at the same time! See you!🚀

18/1/24, 9:01 AM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you.

Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
18/1/24, 9:01 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 9:05 AM - +263 71 656 7965: Noted and clear

18/1/24, 10:20 AM - +263 71 656 7965: Iam through ma'am
18/1/24, 10:24 AM - +263 71 656 7965: I've surely understood some of the information ma'am, I will ask you if I have any problem regarding these projects
18/1/24, 10:33 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, now that our session time is over, let's connect tomorrow at the same time. Meanwhile, I'd like you to share your understanding of the document before our next session. See you!
19/1/24, 8:12 AM - +263 71 656 7965: Okay ma'am, I've understood that this EWYL document consists of 2 projects. The first project  named corporate alliances aligns the roles that I as an Edoofian should play. It emphasizes on identifying nearby or local companies whereby edoofians should share edoofa's vision , its mission and its main functions to the  decision makers. In this project ,we edoofians are supposed to contact these individual decision makers through the LinkedIn ,and convince them to go through Skype with team Edoofa to get full information about this program. After the video call is done,a contract is signed
19/1/24, 8:13 AM - +263 71 656 7965: The second project is for community building. This projects emphasizes on us edoofians to spread information about Edoofa program to  students who have graduated  from senior  secondary schools either recently or in the past 6 months. This project aligns with us edoofians to go in secondary schools and persuade students to get into this program such that they could understand the most critical aspect of developing an organization which is based on growing through creating social impact. Firstly, application forms are filled. This simply mean that an extensive list of all the students or youth who i have enrolled is filled. Secondly, i as an Edoofian then shares edoofa visions and missions to those youths who have recently graduated from senior secondary school or in the last six months throughEdoofa's help.
19/1/24, 8:33 AM - +263 71 656 7965: Morning ma'am
19/1/24, 8:34 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Ashley!

Before beginning today's session, I want you to check out this incredible post :

Let us begin our session with an interesting fact!

*_Did you know that a group of flamingos is called a 'flamboyance.' So, just like the flamboyance of flamingos, let's add a touch of flair to our session today._*

Ready to soar into the world of curiosity?🦩
22/1/24, 8:34 AM - +263 71 656 7965: Yes iam ready
22/1/24, 8:36 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I read your response and saw that you have only mentioned the two projects. Why didn't you notice the third project?
22/1/24, 8:39 AM - +263 71 656 7965: I didn't clearly notice it due to the red font styles, I did read it but I thought it was part of project 2 ,sorry for that ma'am <This message was edited>

22/1/24, 8:41 AM - +263 71 656 7965: Alright ,thank you ma'am
22/1/24, 8:41 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
22/1/24, 8:42 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

22/1/24, 9:00 AM - +263 71 656 7965: Okay ma'am,from this audio,project 1 has been explained. I've understood that the world has become an online business network which makes communication easier between businesses. This project which is the corporate alliance aims to link this edoofa program to the many  decision makers of different companies. Through my effort as an Edoofian, I will use the LinkedIn networking device which can help me to communicate with different technological companies . This could help me have stronger connections evenly for jobs after my graduation in future. After I get connected to any decision makers of these companies, I will then arrange a meeting between Edoofa team and these decision makers
22/1/24, 9:02 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Wow, Good Job Ashley!🤝🏽
22/1/24, 9:02 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I am really happy and proud!🏆

23/1/24, 8:58 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
23/1/24, 9:08 AM - +263 71 656 7965: Okay,project 2 as per my understanding which is the community building works as a key role in connecting Edoofa team with senior students or students who have already completed their final secondary levels.This aims to make edoofians spread information to students are completely serious  or eager to study abroad. With this in line, I as an Edoofian should motivate some students about this program by telling them the advantages of this program, which include lower costs of education payment and the probability of employability in future
23/1/24, 9:09 AM - Ananya Edoofa: That’s awesome, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.
23/1/24, 9:09 AM - Ananya Edoofa: 1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

24/1/24, 8:44 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *_“The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step._”* - Lao Tzu

As we embark on today's session, let's remember that every small effort contributes to significant progress. Let's take that first step together and make the most out of our time. Ready to dive in?
24/1/24, 4:58 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Ashley, I was expecting a response from your end, however, now let us connect tomorrow for our next session.
24/1/24, 5:08 PM - +263 71 656 7965: Sorry ma'am for not being available for today's session I was  busy at the farm yard
25/1/24, 8:30 AM - +263 71 656 7965: Good morning ma'am
25/1/24, 8:35 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Ashley!

Let us begin our session with a fun fact: 

The tongue of a blue whale, the largest animal on Earth, can weigh as much as an elephant. Despite their massive size, blue whales primarily feed on tiny shrimp-like animals called krill, using their enormous tongues to filter them from the water.🐋
25/1/24, 8:37 AM - +263 71 656 7965: morning ma'am I'm fine how are you
25/1/24, 8:38 AM - +263 71 656 7965: 🤣we may begin ma'am
25/1/24, 8:40 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Ashley, what's funny?😅
25/1/24, 8:42 AM - +263 71 656 7965: Okay ma'am, I wasn't truly expecting that fun fact about blue whales ma'am <This message was edited>
25/1/24, 8:55 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Haha, alright! So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students! <This message was edited>
25/1/24, 8:56 AM - +263 71 656 7965: Okay ma'am
25/1/24, 9:00 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
25/1/24, 9:00 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
25/1/24, 9:00 AM - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
25/1/24, 9:00 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
25/1/24, 9:00 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
25/1/24, 9:00 AM - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

I will be appearing for my Advance Level Examination in (Year):-

Preferred year of Admission:- 
August 2023 or August 2024 or August 2025
25/1/24, 9:00 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 9:05 AM - +263 71 656 7965: All clear and noted ma'am
25/1/24, 9:22 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the delayed response; I am facing some technical glitches.
25/1/24, 9:22 AM - +263 71 656 7965: Its okay ma'am
25/1/24, 9:22 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, in order to move ahead with your second project, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
25/1/24, 9:22 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

25/1/24, 9:23 AM - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
25/1/24, 9:23 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
25/1/24, 9:23 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
25/1/24, 9:23 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.

25/1/24, 9:39 AM - +263 71 656 7965: Okay  ma'am, from the audio above, project 3 has been explained which is the African schools education reform mission. This project serves to allow edoofians to have conversations with principals or headmasters of different schools.  However ,I as an Edoofian should list the high schools in my region or area but firstly my Secondary school. For this,I should surely explain more in detail about this edoofa program to these headmasters about the program's advantages and the reason why I chose Edoofa. After that, I will have  to arrange a call between team Edoofa and the head of that particular school <This message was edited>
25/1/24, 9:43 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have- so, congratulations Ashley. However, I’d still like to ask- are there any questions you have about this project?
25/1/24, 9:45 AM - +263 71 656 7965: For now ma'am, I don't have any ,I will update you if I have any queries while processing these projects
