As our team engages with Edoofians and parents at today's meet & greet event in Harare, I couldn't help but notice your absence. We were truly looking forward to connecting with you and your family, and exploring the many growth opportunities that Edoofa offers.

Could you please share why you and your parents couldn't attend?
