Please excuse me for not being able to connect yesterday. We were celebrating Christmas in our office, and I was occupied with decorating the tree. It went really well!

We do not have our sessions over the weekend, so we can now connect on Tuesday. Monday is a holiday due to Christmas!

* As per the invitation, *you* are supposed to attend the event along with your parents on *the 19th of February* which is on Monday. 
* If you are recommending any of *your friends(Non-Edoofians)* along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for *the 18th of February(8am/1pm) or 19th  February(1pm)*. They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event.
