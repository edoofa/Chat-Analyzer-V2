I really hope that your Christmas went well. Let's discuss how we celebrated our Christmas this year in our session! Come on, join your EWYL Line, and let's talk about our celebration!
26/12/23, 4:04 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Mthuli!

I hope you all had the merriest Christmas celebration! 🎄 Due to the festive break, our session on Monday had to be called off. No worries, though – I hope you enjoyed the extra time for the festivities.

To make up for it, let's have a compensatory session *tomorrow at 9:30 am*.
I'm looking forward to catching up with all of you!
26/12/23, 5:22 PM - +263 78 427 4645: Okay mentor it will be done
27/12/23, 5:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Mthuli!

Well, what I have observed today is that if I have not shared a reminder with you before the session, you have clearly missed your session! Don't you think it's a bit irresponsible behavior? Do you get a reminder before your classes at school?
27/12/23, 5:29 PM - +263 78 427 4645: My apologies mentor for my behavior but I did send the messege on the EWYL line this morning and again I am deeply sorry for my behavior

29/12/23, 3:18 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *_New Year is here!🌟_*

As we are going to embark on a new chapter at the dawn of the New Year, I wanted to take a moment to send my warmest wishes your way. May this coming year be filled with joy, laughter, and moments of profound happiness. 🌈

Along with you, the Edoofa Family will also be occupied in *New Year Celebrations from tomorrow till 1 January 2024* and we will *resume from 2 January onwards*🎉

Wishing you a year ahead filled with love, prosperity, and the fulfillment of your heart's desires. May every day be a chance for you to shine and make a positive impact. ✨

Happy New Year in advance! 🎊

7/1/24, 8:46 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called SLICE CON' 24 for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
7/1/24, 8:46 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the 8th, 9th, and 10th of January, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
7/1/24, 10:02 PM - +263 78 427 4645: That is very axciting news mentor
7/1/24, 10:03 PM - +263 78 427 4645: I am looking forward to seeing the photos
11/1/24, 9:21 AM - +263 78 427 4645: Good morning mentor
11/1/24, 11:15 AM - Ananya Edoofa: A lovely morning to you, Mthuli!

Kindly excuse me for the short delay. I wanted to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that was going on for the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! You know, it was so happening, and I am happy to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only this, but we also welcomed various industrial leaders, and it went super well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech made easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us as well. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.

Mthuli, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

In light of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. *As of now, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable* and I am confident that together, we will create something truly extraordinary.

20/2/24, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Hello, Mthuli!

The past three days flew by in a whirlwind for Team Edoofa – both for those in India and those in Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. Now that we've had a chance to catch our breath, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success.

Your insights from the event are highly valued, and I'm keen to hear about your experience. Would you be open to sharing your thoughts, including your interest in attending similar events in the future and any suggestions for improvement? Additionally, if you have captured any memorable moments in photos, we would greatly appreciate you sharing them.

Your perspective is crucial, and I also encourage you to discuss the event with your parents and gather their feedback.🌟
20/2/24, 4:36 PM - +263 78 427 4645: Good afternoon mentor. The event was better than what I had in mind. I got to experience how it feels like to study and live in India under the Edoofa scholarship program through the experiences of other Edoofians who are already in India. From I had learned during the meet and greet program, I now see a glimpse of my dreams becoming true already. I am sorry I forgot to take pictures and videos during the event because of how exciting it was.
