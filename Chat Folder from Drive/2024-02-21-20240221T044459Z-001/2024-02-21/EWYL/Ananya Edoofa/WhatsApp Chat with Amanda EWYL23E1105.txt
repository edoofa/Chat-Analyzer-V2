I understand that there is a short delay in starting our journey; however, amidst the preparations, I also fell sick. Therefore, it took me two days to recover.
11/2/24, 11:57 AM - Ananya Edoofa: By the way, I am thrilled to introduce myself as *Ms. Ananya*, your mentor for the EWYL program. Together, we will work hard and aim for the sky to earn maximum scholarship credits from this program.

So, are you ready to join me on this exciting journey? Let's work hard and reach for the stars!🌟
11/2/24, 11:57 AM - Ananya Edoofa: We will be having our first session on 16th February 2024 and for that, I'd like to offer you a choice between two-time slots. Please select one that works for you:

Monday to Friday, 8:30 AM to 9:30 AM
Monday to Friday, 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM
Let me know which one suits your schedule best.

I hope this message finds you well. I apologize for not being able to connect with you yesterday. Unfortunately, I experienced a technical glitch that prevented me from accessing my WhatsApp account. I've managed to restore it this morning.

I hope you are doing well. I want to inform you that our team is currently occupied with the Africa meet and greet, and as a result, I am a bit busy lately. Since our team has successfully hosted an event in Zimbabwe, we are now preparing for events in other countries as well. Due to this, our sessions are being postponed, but don't worry, we will resume our sessions in the coming two days.
