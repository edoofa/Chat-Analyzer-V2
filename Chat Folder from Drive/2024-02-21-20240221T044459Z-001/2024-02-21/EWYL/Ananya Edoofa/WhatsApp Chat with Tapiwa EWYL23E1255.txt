12/2/24, 2:19 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
12/2/24, 2:22 PM - +263 77 540 5274: Well l do not know
12/2/24, 2:24 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
12/2/24, 2:24 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
12/2/24, 2:25 PM - +263 77 540 5274: Well l understand
12/2/24, 2:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I wish we could have connected for a longer time. However, since our session time is over, let's connect tomorrow at the same time. Have a good day!🌟

Let us begin our session with an amazing fact! 

_Did you know that the Arctic Tern holds the record for the longest migration journey of any animal? These remarkable birds travel up to 71,000 kilometers (44,000 miles) round trip every year from their breeding grounds in the Arctic to their wintering grounds in Antarctica and back again. It's an astonishing feat of endurance and navigation!_🐦
