We will connect from Monday to Friday at 8:30 am to complete our orientation. Later, we will connect twice a week, for which I will share the slots after completing your orientation. <This message was edited>
12/2/24, 8:42 AM - +263 71 435 1714: It's fine ma'am but l did not understand the the last phrase written ' *we will connect t* '
12/2/24, 8:47 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly excuse me, is it okay now?
12/2/24, 8:48 AM - +263 71 435 1714: Yes it's okay
12/2/24, 8:49 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Wonderful, my student! So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
12/2/24, 8:49 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/2/24, 8:55 AM - +263 71 435 1714: Thank you ma'am for the warm welcome. We will work together to reach the summit as you believe sure.l am glad to have you as my mentor.

12/2/24, 9:14 AM - +263 71 435 1714: <Media omitted>
12/2/24, 9:16 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Well,  Your curiosity and enthusiasm for this field have not gone unnoticed, and I wanted to commend you for your dedication to expanding your knowledge in this area.

It's truly inspiring to see students like you showing such genuine interest in electronic engineering. Your willingness to explore and engage with this complex and fascinating subject speaks volumes about your dedication to learning and your potential for future success.
12/2/24, 9:17 AM - +263 71 435 1714: Thank you ma'am.
12/2/24, 9:19 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
12/2/24, 9:20 AM - +263 71 435 1714: No, what are they?
12/2/24, 9:22 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
12/2/24, 9:22 AM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
12/2/24, 9:30 AM - +263 71 435 1714: Okay, l understand.
12/2/24, 9:31 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
12/2/24, 9:33 AM - +263 71 435 1714: Well, it's fine.
12/2/24, 9:36 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
12/2/24, 9:39 AM - +263 71 435 1714: Yes,sounds very great
12/2/24, 9:43 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
12/2/24, 9:43 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/2/24, 9:54 AM - Ananya Edoofa: It's been wonderful getting to know you and having you here. I wish we could have connected for a longer time. However, since our session time is over, let's connect tomorrow at the same time. Have a good day!🌟
12/2/24, 9:55 AM - +263 71 435 1714: Thank you, have a good day
12/2/24, 10:00 AM - +263 71 435 1714: I am done reading the newsletter
13/2/24, 8:31 AM - +263 71 435 1714: Good morning Ms Ananya
13/2/24, 8:32 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Blessing!

Let us begin our session with an amazing fact! 

_Did you know that the Arctic Tern holds the record for the longest migration journey of any animal? These remarkable birds travel up to 71,000 kilometers (44,000 miles) round trip every year from their breeding grounds in the Arctic to their wintering grounds in Antarctica and back again. It's an astonishing feat of endurance and navigation!_🐦 <This message was edited>
13/2/24, 8:35 AM - +263 71 435 1714: I am fine thanks and how are you
13/2/24, 8:40 AM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
13/2/24, 8:46 AM - +263 71 435 1714: I like the first section which contains motivational quotes
13/2/24, 8:48 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
13/2/24, 8:50 AM - +263 71 435 1714: It sounds good and helpful indeed
13/2/24, 8:50 AM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
13/2/24, 8:51 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/2/24, 9:29 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let us discuss this further tomorrow at the same time.

Remember that your consistency is something that will earn you credits here, so be regular, and trust me, no one can stop you from being at the top! All the best, good day! 🚀

14/2/24, 8:54 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
14/2/24, 9:03 AM - +263 71 435 1714: I understood that the benefits of being in the program is to to me aware of the job opportunities and what is happening in the business environment surrounding me so as to equip me for my career goals and the destination.l also understood that the major part is squiring the skill to perform the task in line with my aspirations.Futhermore l also learnt about being technology literate so as to move on with the world since many businesses are being done online due to the COVID ISSUES.One should also have a never give up attitude,he should try and try again even if he fails multiple time he should continue trying.
14/2/24, 9:08 AM - +263 71 435 1714: On the project section,it's basically about being able to connect with big companies and convincing them.Even if they treat me rudely l should not quite but l should continue with the project till l finish the task.After connecting with the company l also have to make sure that l link the company with my Seniors so that they communicate and grow in their business.
14/2/24, 9:10 AM - +263 71 435 1714: Generally, the project is more about teaming up and networking.
14/2/24, 9:15 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good job, Blessing!
14/2/24, 9:15 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
