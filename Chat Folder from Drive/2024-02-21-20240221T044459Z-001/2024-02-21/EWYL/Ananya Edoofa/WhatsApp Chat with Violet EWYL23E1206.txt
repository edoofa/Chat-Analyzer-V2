12/2/24, 1:53 PM - +263 78 199 1982: This message was deleted
12/2/24, 1:53 PM - +263 78 199 1982: Thank you, l have watched the video
12/2/24, 1:56 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?
12/2/24, 2:03 PM - +263 78 199 1982: Ok, my name is Violet .l am a girl aged 17. I am an A level student. I like to play netball. My aspiration is to be a successful young lady or l would rather say a successful lawyer .During my free time lm usually engrossed in novels
12/2/24, 2:09 PM - Ananya Edoofa: That's wonderful, Violet! Being an A-level student and aspiring to become a successful lawyer shows great ambition and determination. Your love for playing netball demonstrates your commitment to staying active and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Immersing yourself in novels during your free time is a fantastic way to expand your knowledge, vocabulary, and imagination. Keep pursuing your goals with passion and dedication, and you'll surely achieve success in your endeavors!
12/2/24, 2:10 PM - +263 78 199 1982: Thank you😊
12/2/24, 2:13 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
12/2/24, 2:16 PM - +263 78 199 1982: No
12/2/24, 2:18 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
12/2/24, 2:22 PM - +263 78 199 1982: Yes cant wait for the "Wednesday Wisdom"
12/2/24, 2:24 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
12/2/24, 2:24 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/2/24, 2:28 PM - +263 78 199 1982: Ok

13/2/24, 1:49 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Violet

I have observed that you have not been texting me at your session timings; it has always been me who drops a reminder message at your session time. Has your teacher ever dropped a reminder message to you before the class?
13/2/24, 2:04 PM - +263 78 199 1982: At school we always remind the teacher
13/2/24, 2:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: That's alright, however now that our session time is over, let us connect tomorrow at the same time. Have a good day ahead!🚀
13/2/24, 2:40 PM - +263 78 199 1982: Thank you
