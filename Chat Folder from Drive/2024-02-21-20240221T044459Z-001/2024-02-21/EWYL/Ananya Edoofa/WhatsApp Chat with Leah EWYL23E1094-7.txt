5/1/24, 4:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, great! Well, kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you earlier. I was involved in a call with my students who will be presenting to prominent CEOs and entrepreneurs during a significant industrial visit scheduled for next week. Training them is crucial, especially since it's their first time participating in such an event.

We will reconnect in our next session, which is on Monday, as we do not hold sessions over the weekend. Meanwhile, I am sharing a video with you. Wishing you a happy weekend!
5/1/24, 4:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

I will surely watch the video 
Thank you, wishing you a happy weekend too.
6/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Leah!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
6/1/24, 3:56 PM - +263 77 821 9098: Waal noted ma'am <This message was edited>
6/1/24, 4:03 PM - +263 78 536 5920: Oh this is wonderful news 
Wishing you a great and fun visit. <This message was edited>
6/1/24, 4:03 PM - +263 78 536 5920: Noted with thanks ma’am
11/1/24, 1:41 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Leah!

Before beginning our session, I want to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that took place over the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! It was so happening, and I am delighted to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only that, but we also hosted various industrial leaders, and it went exceptionally well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech Made Easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.

11/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 77 821 9098: That's wonderful news you share with us thank you
11/1/24, 1:54 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?
11/1/24, 4:01 PM - +263 78 536 5920: Good day to you ma’am , I’m really sorry about not being able to respond to you earlier. Schools have opened so I had lessons throughout the day and I’m really sorry for not notifying you. My sincere apologies. <This message was edited>
11/1/24, 4:03 PM - +263 78 536 5920: Oh this is lovely and wonderful ma’am 
I can see that these proud Indian Edoofians really enjoyed the visit from the pictures you have sent.
11/1/24, 4:04 PM - +263 78 536 5920: My favorite hobbies are baking and singing.I love baking because I get to be creative in the kitchen and seeing how my recipes turn out. Plus, I love being able to share my creations with friends and family. It's a great way to show people how much I care about them. Also singing is a way for me to express myself and let out my emotions. It's like therapy for me, and it helps me relax and forget about my worries. I love the feeling of being totally immersed in a song and letting the music take over. Singing also gives me a sense of accomplishment and pride when I perform well.


Studying biology is my passion for it has opened my eyes to the amazing complexity and beauty of life on Earth. I've learned about the interconnectedness of all living things, and how everything is connected in some way. I've also gained a greater understanding of how my own body works, and what I can do to keep it healthy. 

One of my goals is being a biotechnologist, because I see the potential for it to make a real difference in the world. This field is helping solve on of the world’s biggest challenges like food security and developing ne treatments for diseases.I want to be part of the next generation of scientists who are using cutting-edge technologies to solve big problems. I know it will take hard work and dedication, but I'm ready to take on the challenge.



Thank you
12/1/24, 1:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Leah!

Let us begin our session with a fact! Did you know that the total weight of ants on Earth is comparable to the total weight of all the humans on this planet? It's a staggering reminder of the incredible diversity and abundance of life around us.🤯🐜
12/1/24, 2:24 PM - +263 78 536 5920: Afternoon, how are you doing this afternoon?

I didn’t know that but it’s just amazing.
12/1/24, 2:25 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Why are you late, Leah?
12/1/24, 2:25 PM - +263 78 536 5920: I’m sorry ma’am for being late.
I was at school just got home.
12/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I understand, however, I want to let you know that it is crucial for you to complete your orientation program with me. It would be great if you or your parents could attend the initial 4-5 sessions with me so that you can understand the outline of the program clearly.
12/1/24, 2:27 PM - +263 78 536 5920: That’s fine ma’am.
I think that will not be a problem 
Thank you
12/1/24, 2:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, we shall connect in our next session. Since we don't have sessions over the weekend, let's reconnect on Monday. See you then!🚀
12/1/24, 2:29 PM - +263 78 536 5920: Thank you ma’am will surely be available.

Have a great weekend
15/1/24, 1:31 PM - +263 78 536 5920: Afternoon ma’am, I am fine 
Hope you are doing great.

This is wondeful
15/1/24, 1:39 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, due to a technical glitch, I cannot access our last conversation. Could you please share a screenshot with me so that I can move forward?
15/1/24, 1:42 PM - +263 78 536 5920: <Media omitted>
15/1/24, 1:42 PM - +263 78 536 5920: <Media omitted>
15/1/24, 1:45 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
15/1/24, 1:47 PM - +263 78 536 5920: No ma’am
15/1/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
15/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
15/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 78 536 5920: I have understood the two key objectives. 
Thank you
15/1/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
15/1/24, 2:10 PM - +263 78 536 5920: That’s lovely , I can’t wait to work with them. 
Thank you ma’am for the introduction.
15/1/24, 2:12 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
15/1/24, 2:16 PM - +263 78 536 5920: Yes ma’am so interesting
15/1/24, 2:21 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
15/1/24, 2:21 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/1/24, 2:22 PM - +263 78 536 5920: Yes ma’am 20 minutes is enough 
Thank you
15/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
15/1/24, 2:29 PM - +263 78 536 5920: I’m sorry ma’am I’m not yet done I am at school so I’m facing some challenges. 
I have to attend a lesson now.
Will you please excuse me ma’am
15/1/24, 2:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright! Now let us conclude our session with a motivating quote : 

_Remember, every step forward counts, no matter how small. Embrace the challenges, for they are the stepping stones to success. Keep pushing, stay positive, and watch your journey unfold. You've got this!_🚀
15/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 78 536 5920: Thank you so much ma’am.
I really appreciate it
16/1/24, 1:29 PM - +263 78 536 5920: Good afternoon ma’am 
Hope you are doing well. 

Yesterday I managed to read the newsletter and from the newsletter, I found everything interesting especially how Nyasha is so inspirational. 
I also liked the three quotes and the questions, how they are just interesting.
16/1/24, 1:41 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Leah!

I hope you're all ready for a great session. Let's kick things off with a quick joke to lighten the mood:

Why did the math book look sad? Well, because it had too many problems! 😄
16/1/24, 1:49 PM - +263 78 536 5920: 🤣🤣
16/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 78 536 5920: I am ready but we have no electricity due to rains so my phone is running low on battery.
16/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, let us try to finish our session early!
16/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound? <This message was edited>

16/1/24, 1:56 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of.

16/1/24, 2:13 PM - +263 78 536 5920: My school timetable has changed, some of my lessons are starting from 1350hrs to 1500hrs of which I have a session with you ma’am.

PROJECT 1

Corporate Alliance 
Aim: Understand the market you are going to work with and identify the companies in the country (digital/ technological)

Step 1
1. Identify all family members and neighbors who work in that service sector 
2. Tell them about your objectives and how EDOOFA is helping me with my employability after graduation 
3. Create a LinkedIn account, this is a business platform where you can look for companies and employees who are working for the companies and connect with them 
4. You should contact the directors and Human Resources Managers of the companies 

FACTORS CONSIDERED WHEN CHOOSING A COMPANY 
1. Nature of company- should be either student centric, a recreational or a content - centric platform (eg Ed-tech)
2. Scale of company- should not be too big or too small( can vary from 50-200)
3. Financial stability- companies should be financially sound 
4. Background of founder- companies with a founder having a strong background ( in terms of experience and qualifications) are the most suitable companies.

STEPS TO FOLLOW ALONG WITH KEEPING THE ABOVE FACTORS INTO CONSIDERATION
1. Searching 
2. Get more details about the company like it’s foundation, area of expertise, functioning and past elaborations etc 
3. Study the website of the company 
4. Check the various social media pages of the company 
5. Study and understand the background of the founder and other core members 
6. After checking the background start reaching out to them by dropping an  invitation note and sending a connection request.

24/1/24, 2:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I understand that she is at school; however, I hope you are aware that attending the orientation sessions with me is extremely crucial. Since I do not want my students to lag, what I can assist you with is having you attend the session with me and understand the basics of the program.

This will ensure a smooth process, and we can later connect on the projects only. Please let me know if you proceed in this manner.

Thank you
25/1/24, 1:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Leah!

Let us begin our session with a fun fact: 

The tongue of a blue whale, the largest animal on Earth, can weigh as much as an elephant. Despite their massive size, blue whales primarily feed on tiny shrimp-like animals called krill, using their enormous tongues to filter them from the water.🐋
25/1/24, 2:06 PM - +263 77 821 9098: Good afternoon yes we can

29/1/24, 1:35 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon,Leah!

Let us begin our session as I  wanted to quickly share how we celebrated Republic Day this year!

https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/in-pictures-republic-day-parade-2024/article67782312.ece
29/1/24, 1:38 PM - +263 78 536 5920: Afternoon ma’am how are you, hope you had a wonderful holiday
29/1/24, 1:46 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Done on sharing the form 🌟 
It has been shared with our dedicated counseling team. In the meantime, you must maintain regular communication with the students and address any queries they may have.
29/1/24, 1:46 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Leah, have you shared your own information here?
29/1/24, 1:47 PM - +263 78 536 5920: Yes ma’am
29/1/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 78 536 5920: I’m very sorry for the misunderstanding, will surely share with other people. 
Thank you ma’am
29/1/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
29/1/24, 2:06 PM - +263 78 536 5920: Noted with thanks ma’am
29/1/24, 2:10 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
29/1/24, 2:10 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
29/1/24, 2:10 PM - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
29/1/24, 2:10 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
29/1/24, 2:10 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
29/1/24, 2:10 PM - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

29/1/24, 2:24 PM - +263 78 536 5920: Okay ma’am thank you
29/1/24, 2:25 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let us connect tomorrow at the same time. 

Have a good day ahead!🚀
29/1/24, 2:25 PM - +263 78 536 5920: Thank you ma’am for the session 
You too have a good day ahead
30/1/24, 1:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Leah!

How are you doing? Did you know that the longest river in the world is the Nile River in Africa, stretching over 6,650 kilometers (4,130 miles)?🤔
30/1/24, 1:44 PM - +263 78 536 5920: Afternoon ma’am how are you ?

Yes i knew that one
30/1/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Thank you for asking, Leah! I am good.
30/1/24, 1:54 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, in order to move ahead with your second project, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
30/1/24, 1:54 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

30/1/24, 1:54 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:

30/1/24, 1:54 PM - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
30/1/24, 1:54 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
30/1/24, 1:54 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below.

_*Did you know that a day on Venus is actually longer than a year on Venus? Even though it only takes Venus about 225 Earth days to go around the sun, it spins really slowly, taking about 243 Earth days to turn once on its axis. So, a day on Venus is longer than a whole year there! 🫨*_

7/2/24, 11:25 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Leah!

I have been expecting to hear from you for the past couple of days, but I can see you have not been able to get back to me for certain reasons I am unaware of. You see, I have been looking forward to having you at the event as I know how beneficial it will be for you. Most of my students have already quite enthusiastically reserved seats for themselves and their family and friends.

Is everything alright? Are you facing any challenges? Is there something you'd like to share?
7/2/24, 11:25 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Yes!
7/2/24, 11:33 AM - +263 78 536 5920: Good morning 
I’m really sorry ma’am for not notifying you. I was having challenges with the network and electricity, we had no electricity for the past few weeks , which caused me to be absent in the sessions. 

Then nowadays I’m so busy at school, the lessons are being delayed and I’m failing to cope with our scheduled time. <This message was edited>

8/2/24, 1:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: As we are ready to begin our new journey! Before that, I'm super excited to share about a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

Because of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. As of now, we won't be having our session as per this new schedule. However, worry not! We will resume our sessions post-Africa trip!  Meanwhile, you can keep working on your projects and keep me posted on your EWYL group.
8/2/24, 1:35 PM - +263 78 536 5920: This sounds so exciting. 
Tell me more about this trip. 

As for my projects I will surely keep working on them.

Well the event was astounding for both my parents and I . We really appreciated the meet and greet 24 because all of our queries were answered. The best part was that we got to meet Mr Angad Singh and Mr Avreen the founders, Mr Gupta and the rest of the edoofa team. For me it was an educational session and open minded discussion too which was wonderful. 

I would like to thank you for this Meet and Greet event and I am looking forward to attend more sessions with Edoofa.
