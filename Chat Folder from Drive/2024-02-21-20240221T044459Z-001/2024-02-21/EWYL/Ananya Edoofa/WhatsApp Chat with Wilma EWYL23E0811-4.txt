Wilma is on holiday in some  resort
 area network is very poor there but  she will be back on 2 January aa well.
2/1/24, 4:10 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Wilma!

I hope you had a fantastic New Year! Because of the holiday break, our Monday session had to be canceled, but don't worry about it. I hope you enjoyed the extra time for celebrations.🌟

To make up for it, let's have a special session *tomorrow at 9:30 AM*. Get ready to tell me how you celebrated the New Year, and I'll also share my resolution with you. I'm looking forward to catching up with you!🕤
2/1/24, 8:10 PM - +263 77 756 5183: Hallo ma'am. Thank you very much. I am indeed excited!
7/1/24, 8:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called SLICE CON' 24 for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
7/1/24, 8:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the 8th, 9th, and 10th of January, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
8/1/24, 9:05 AM - +263 77 756 5183: Noted madam. It is quite saddening that I too am going back to school on the 9th.I hope to resume my sessions as soon as I come back on the 27th of March. 💔

It was a pleasure working with you Ms Ananya. You are lively and and very cheerful, it would be hard not to miss you.🙈

Thank you for being exciting to work with.🤍🙂👍🏾

It's goodbye for now 💔😭
12/1/24, 4:14 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Wilma!

Please accept my apologies for the delayed response. I was engaged in our three-day-long industrial visit, SLICE-CON!

20/2/24, 3:13 PM - +263 77 451 2698: One of the suggestions she highlighted was that
If all the enrolled Edoofians were given Tshirts so that they could showcase in the Edoofa T-shirt Regalia it would have been also an easier way to market the brand
20/2/24, 3:14 PM - +263 77 451 2698: Otherwise basically all  what was covered in the presentations and the question and answer session we had already deliberated on it here online
