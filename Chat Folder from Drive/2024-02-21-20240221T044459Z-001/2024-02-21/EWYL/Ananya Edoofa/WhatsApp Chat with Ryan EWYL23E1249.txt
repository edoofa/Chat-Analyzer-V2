Your aspiration to become a renowned developer on an international scale is ambitious and admirable. It's clear that your passion for this field is a strong driving force.

12/2/24, 2:19 PM - +263 78 739 4878: Thank you
12/2/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
12/2/24, 2:20 PM - +263 78 739 4878: No l do not can you please explain
12/2/24, 2:21 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
12/2/24, 2:22 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
12/2/24, 2:26 PM - +263 78 739 4878: I now understand what the 2 goals mean and what they represent <This message was edited>

The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
