23/1/24, 2:15 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Nice to meet you! Your background growing up in rural Manicaland Province is interesting. It sounds like life was centered around subsistence farming for your family. Kudos on making some extra cash from selling produce! And football as a favorite hobby from primary level? That's awesome! As you grow, aiming to be a town planner is a great goal. Best of luck on that journey! Feel free to share more about your experiences and aspirations.
23/1/24, 4:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let's conclude it here. We will pick up from where we left off tomorrow.

24/1/24, 1:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *_“The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step._”* - Lao Tzu

As we embark on today's session, let's remember that every small effort contributes to significant progress. Let's take that first step together and make the most out of our time. Ready to dive in?
24/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Yes mam l am ready
24/1/24, 1:40 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 1:41 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Oky mam thank you
24/1/24, 1:46 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
24/1/24, 1:48 PM - +263 78 115 4509: No mam l don't know them
24/1/24, 1:54 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
24/1/24, 1:54 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
24/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 78 115 4509: 👍
24/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Oky mam noted
24/1/24, 2:05 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
24/1/24, 2:13 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Oky mam
24/1/24, 2:15 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
24/1/24, 2:16 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Well noted
24/1/24, 2:17 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
24/1/24, 2:17 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 2:31 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Lm finished now mam
24/1/24, 2:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Before we wrap up, here's a quick joke to add a smile to your day:

Why don't scientists trust atoms?

Because they make up everything!

Thank you all for a great session. Remember, laughter is the best medicine. Until next time!🚀
24/1/24, 2:35 PM - +263 78 115 4509: 🤣🤣 oky mam thank you have a good day you too
25/1/24, 1:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Nyasha!

Let us begin our session with a fun fact: 

The tongue of a blue whale, the largest animal on Earth, can weigh as much as an elephant. Despite their massive size, blue whales primarily feed on tiny shrimp-like animals called krill, using their enormous tongues to filter them from the water.🐋
25/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Afternoon mam how are you
25/1/24, 1:45 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Very impressive mam thank you
25/1/24, 1:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Nyasha?
25/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Very brilliant mam
25/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
25/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 1:56 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Oky mam.

25/1/24, 2:11 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Mam l have understand that this program of EWYL is there to to help us as students especially  on deducting our financial problem which could help help us to achieve our goals . L also leant that this teaches us to be very constructive on this program and also we should be open to you as our mentor to improve our understanding for us to persuade the best and also we need to be creative on this program
25/1/24, 2:15 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great!  I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
25/1/24, 2:15 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 2:24 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Oky mam noted
25/1/24, 2:28 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
25/1/24, 2:28 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 2:32 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Still loading mam network problem
25/1/24, 2:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While concluding our session let me highlight that we will continue our conversation on Monday as we do not have our sessions over the weekend. Also, tomorrow, we won't be having our session as it's Republic Day in India. Wishing you a happy Republic Day! It's a special day when we celebrate the adoption of our constitution.

25/1/24, 3:26 PM - +263 78 115 4509: On this understand that when l look for company search, l should search for a potential company that could be able to collaborate with Edoofa and that company should be willing to help students that has been enrolled by Edoofa .l should also need to know the nature of that company. That company should be financially sound and also it should know the background of the founder of that company and also to know about the platform that could be used by that company
29/1/24, 1:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Nyasha!

Let us begin our session as I  wanted to quickly share how we celebrated Republic Day this year!

1/2/24, 1:42 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Nyasha!

How are you doing? Let us begin our session with a small joke; Why don't skeletons fight each other?

They don't have the guts!😅
1/2/24, 1:56 PM - +263 78 115 4509: OK noted
1/2/24, 1:59 PM - Ananya Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
1/2/24, 2:03 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Okt sounds good mam
1/2/24, 2:10 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
1/2/24, 2:12 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Oky mam
1/2/24, 2:14 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
1/2/24, 2:14 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
1/2/24, 2:14 PM - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
1/2/24, 2:14 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
1/2/24, 2:14 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
1/2/24, 2:14 PM - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

Let us begin our session with an amazing fact! 

_*Did you know that a day on Venus is actually longer than a year on Venus? Even though it only takes Venus about 225 Earth days to go around the sun, it spins really slowly, taking about 243 Earth days to turn once on its axis. So, a day on Venus is longer than a whole year there! 🫨*_
5/2/24, 1:58 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Mam afternoon
5/2/24, 1:58 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Lm so sorry mam l am late e
5/2/24, 2:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: That's alright!
5/2/24, 2:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, in order to move ahead with your second project, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
5/2/24, 2:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

5/2/24, 2:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
5/2/24, 2:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

Let us begin our session with a fact about elephants: Did you know that elephants are one of the few animals that can recognize themselves in a mirror? This ability indicates a level of self-awareness that is rare in the animal kingdom and suggests that elephants have a complex understanding of themselves and their surroundings. 🐘

7/2/24, 3:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that we will be beginning our new journey. From now onwards we will be having our session on a dedicated EWYL Line. Please save the EWYL Line contact number: +91 98107 89170.

Every day you have to come and say "I am a proud EDOOFIAN' on the EWYL line.
It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, "I am a proud Edoofian.
7/2/24, 3:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: As we plan for our sessions, you have the flexibility to choose between the following options:

Option 1: Monday and Thursday
Option 2: Tuesday and Friday
Feel free to select the days that best suit your schedule. Following your decision, I will provide you with an updated timetable.

Additionally, every Wednesday, I will share a piece of Wednesday wisdom, and we can discuss it in our subsequent session. Similarly, every Saturday, you will receive your weekend activity, and we will review it in our next session. Both of these components are essential for your evaluation and progress, so ensure their completion.

It's crucial to note that you will only receive your lessons and activities if you follow your EWYL (Every Week, Your Life) ritual consistently. Make it a daily practice, especially in the morning, to ensure timely sharing of activities and lessons.
7/2/24, 3:04 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Option 1 Monday and Thursday mam
8/2/24, 1:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon! 
As we are ready to begin our new journey! Before that, I'm super excited to share about a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

Because of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. As of now, we won't be having our session as per this new schedule. However, worry not! We will resume our sessions post-Africa trip!  Meanwhile, you can keep working on your projects and keep me posted on your EWYL group.
