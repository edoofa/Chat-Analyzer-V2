26/12/23, 1:59 PM - +263 78 653 1903: Ohhhh beautiful
26/12/23, 2:00 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, it’s been an interesting conversation with you so far. However, I have some cool things left to share and thus, I think we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
26/12/23, 2:00 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 2:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: For today, we need to wrap up our session, and we'll continue this discussion in our next session, which is tomorrow at 1:30 p.m!
27/12/23, 1:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Adelaide! What did one wall say to the other wall?

I'll meet you at the corner!' Now that we've built a little humor, let's construct some great ideas in today's session.😄
27/12/23, 1:32 PM - +263 78 653 1903: Alright ma'am. I have successfully approached 2 students to join the Edoofa team and created the groups and added you
27/12/23, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: That's lovely, Adelaide!
27/12/23, 1:34 PM - +263 78 653 1903: One of them, Daniel, is asking about studying medicine. I asked him to redirect the question to you. May you kindly assist
27/12/23, 1:46 PM - +263 78 653 1903: Please help
27/12/23, 1:54 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Adelaide, in India, to study medicine, one has to be Indian as it requires sitting for a government exam.
27/12/23, 1:57 PM - +263 78 653 1903: Ohh ok. Thank you
27/12/23, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
27/12/23, 2:05 PM - +263 78 653 1903: With regards to what ma'am?
27/12/23, 2:05 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here, Adelaida!
27/12/23, 2:15 PM - +263 78 653 1903: So I'm supposed to create a list and reach out to headmasters/principals of local high schools in my region and tell them about Edoofa and help them create synergies
27/12/23, 2:17 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay great, now allow me to recap this project quickly for you in 2 steps:
27/12/23, 2:17 PM - Ananya Edoofa: As a proud edoofian and as a student who is going to go for international higher education, you will connect with various principals on this project.

27/12/23, 2:17 PM - Ananya Edoofa: ​After that, you will share in details about the program with the principals and ask them if you can schedule a call with the Edooa program Director so that the students of their school can also achieve the same.
27/12/23, 2:18 PM - Ananya Edoofa: After the school authorities respond to your message and you can set up our meeting with them, you can ask them about the date and the time when they would be available.

29/12/23, 2:55 PM - +263 78 653 1903: Well, the tombstone is assembled atop the grave of whoever it is you are having the ceremony for, and covered with white fabric. A brief church service is held by the site and then the cloth is removed then celebration begins

2/1/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright! So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Monday and Thursday : 9:30 a.m to 11:00 a.m
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
2/1/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
2/1/24, 1:56 PM - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
2/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 78 653 1903: This is done ma'am
2/1/24, 2:09 PM - +263 78 653 1903: Does this mean I am having session everyday at half past 9?
2/1/24, 2:10 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Not everyday, only on Mondays and Thursdays!
2/1/24, 2:11 PM - +263 78 653 1903: Is attendance taken everyday? At what time?
2/1/24, 2:12 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would recommend you to follow your EWYL ritual daily early in the morning!
2/1/24, 2:17 PM - +263 78 653 1903: Alright ma'am
2/1/24, 2:22 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Have you dropped the message on the EWYL line?
2/1/24, 2:29 PM - +263 78 653 1903: Yes ma'am
2/1/24, 2:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright!
3/1/24, 1:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Adelaide! 🌞

Let's start the day with a bit of fun and mystery. Here's a riddle for you: 

'I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have nobody, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?'
3/1/24, 1:46 PM - +263 78 653 1903: Good afternoon
4/1/24, 9:38 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Adelaide!

7/1/24, 8:47 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called SLICE CON' 24 for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
7/1/24, 8:47 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the 8th, 9th, and 10th of January, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
7/1/24, 9:02 PM - +263 78 653 1903: Alright ma'am. Not a problem
24/1/24, 10:40 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *_🌟 URGENT UPDATE 🌟_*

Adelaide, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

In light of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. *As of now, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable* and I am confident that together, we will create something truly extraordinary.
24/1/24, 10:47 AM - +263 78 653 1903: I'm super excited
24/1/24, 10:47 AM - +263 78 653 1903: I am a proud Edoofian
24/1/24, 10:48 AM - +263 78 653 1903: I don't mind volunteering. Just be in touch
25/1/24, 1:00 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Adelaide!

I have some exciting news to share with you. Tomorrow, we are going to celebrate Republic Day! Now, let me tell you a bit about it.

Republic Day is a special day in India. It's a time when we remember and celebrate the day our country adopted its Constitution. Just like a constitution helps guide a country, ours outlines the rules and principles that make India the diverse and vibrant place it is.

On Republic Day, we have a big parade in the capital city, where people from all over the country come together to showcase our culture, traditions, and achievements. It's like a colorful and lively show with music, dance, and different displays. The Indian flag is hoisted, and everyone sings the national anthem with pride.

People also fly kites, dress up in traditional clothes, and enjoy delicious food! 🇮🇳✨
25/1/24, 1:02 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 6:40 AM - +263 78 653 1903: Good morning and happy republic day!
27/1/24, 12:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *🌞 Good morning, Adelaide!*

Get ready to feel the butterflies in your stomach because I'm here to make your day! I won't spill all the details here, but I've recorded a special audio message filled with enthusiasm, encouragement and a whole lot of excitement. Your name is shining bright, and I can't wait for you to listen in on the great news.

So, go, play, and get ready for a burst of positivity coming your way! 🚀
27/1/24, 12:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/1/24, 12:41 PM - +263 78 653 1903: Hello Miss Ananya. The pronunciation is correct. Thank you very much for the opportunity. You've made my day. I won't disappoint. I'll be ready Monday
27/1/24, 3:05 PM - Ananya Edoofa: A few of my students have classes scheduled for 1:30 PM, and I believe moving our call to 2:30 PM would accommodate everyone's schedule more effectively. So, let us connect at 2:30 PM.

20/2/24, 11:48 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Hello,Adelaide!

The past three days flew by in a whirlwind for Team Edoofa – both for those in India and those in Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. Now that we've had a chance to catch our breath, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success.

Your insights from the event are highly valued, and I'm keen to hear about your experience. Would you be open to sharing your thoughts, including your interest in attending similar events in the future and any suggestions for improvement? Additionally, if you have captured any memorable moments in photos, we would greatly appreciate you sharing them.

Your perspective is crucial, and I also encourage you to discuss the event with your parents and gather their feedback.🌟
20/2/24, 12:31 PM - +263 78 653 1903: Hello ma'am. The past few days were beautifully rewarding. It helped me hone my social interaction skills, networking and so much more. I was the MC for all the days and I had a blast. Making friends with the other coordinators and meeting fellow Edoofians really opened my eyes as I saw the magnitude of your work and had personal interactions with the team. Even my mom has nothing but praise for team Edoofa. I would love to attend/coordinate more events of this nature in the future. 10/10 experience. Just beautiful. I only have one suggestion, getting all parents and attendees to attend the event in Harare proved difficult due to resource constraints, and the time required. In the future having the event in not just Harare or Bulawayo,  but other major cities like Mutare, Masvingo, Marondera and Kwekwe. It will encourage even more people to attend and here about Edoofa. All on all... Absolute perfection

20/2/24, 1:00 PM - +263 78 653 1903: One last thing I think I forgot to mention... Many parents had queries regarding living conditions, school life, social life, etcetera. While we had Tiriwashe Mandota, an Edoofian who has already gotten his degree and is now Zimbabwe based, share his experience, some parents mentioned that it wasn't enough and wanted to speak to someone who is currently studying in India, to give a more 'recent' idea of the situation and stuff
20/2/24, 2:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Thank you immensely for your kind words and glowing feedback! We're thrilled to hear that your experience as the MC for our recent events was nothing short of fantastic. It's heartwarming to know that you found the opportunity to hone your social interaction skills, connect with fellow Edoofians, and build relationships with our team members so rewarding.

Your suggestion to diversify our event locations to include cities like Mutare, Masvingo, Marondera, and Kwekwe is truly insightful. We wholeheartedly agree that expanding our reach to these areas will make our events more accessible and allow us to connect with even more individuals who could benefit from the opportunities we offer.
20/2/24, 2:51 PM - +263 78 653 1903: Most welcome. Thank you for your feedback
