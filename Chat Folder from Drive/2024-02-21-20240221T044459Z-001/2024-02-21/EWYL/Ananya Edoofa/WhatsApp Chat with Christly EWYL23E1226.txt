12/2/24, 2:08 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
12/2/24, 2:09 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Can you please enlighten me about the two key objectives
12/2/24, 2:09 PM - +263 78 835 4179: It will be wonderful working with you all
12/2/24, 2:13 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
12/2/24, 2:13 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
12/2/24, 2:19 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Ok I get it
12/2/24, 2:20 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Wow , I understand that perfectly
12/2/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
12/2/24, 2:21 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Ok it's nice to meet to them, I am thrilled to be working with them
12/2/24, 2:22 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
12/2/24, 2:24 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Ues really interesting
12/2/24, 2:24 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Yes
12/2/24, 2:28 PM - +263 78 835 4179: I would go with the Moanday/Thursday sessions here
12/2/24, 3:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, we are ready to begin our new journey! Before that, I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

Because of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. As of now, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable. Meanwhile, you can keep working on your targets and keep me posted on your EWYL group.
12/2/24, 3:49 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Ok sure that's amazing and I would love to volunteer
13/2/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Christly!

I have observed that you have not been texting me at your session timings; it has always been me who drops a reminder message at your session time. Has your teacher ever dropped a reminder message to you before the class?
13/2/24, 2:07 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Hi, sorry my bad
13/2/24, 2:07 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Good afternoon
13/2/24, 2:35 PM - Ananya Edoofa: That's alright, however now that our session time is over, let us connect tomorrow at the same time. Have a good day ahead!🚀
13/2/24, 2:35 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Ok thank you
14/2/24, 1:31 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Good afternoon everyone
14/2/24, 1:36 PM - +263 78 835 4179: It's time for our session
14/2/24, 1:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Christly!

How are you doing? Are you ready for the session?🚀
14/2/24, 1:42 PM - +263 78 835 4179: I am fine thanks how are you
14/2/24, 1:42 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Yes sure we may proceed
14/2/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
14/2/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/2/24, 1:54 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Ok thank u lemme go through it
14/2/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
14/2/24, 2:12 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Yes it is, I would love to be there one day
14/2/24, 2:18 PM - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
14/2/24, 2:18 PM - +263 78 835 4179: I have a question though,  what is the test based on exactly
14/2/24, 2:18 PM - +263 78 835 4179: That sounds awesome
14/2/24, 2:19 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/2/24, 2:21 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Oooh ok I see, thank you, but are there ant specific areas that one needs to specialise in
14/2/24, 2:24 PM - Ananya Edoofa: No dear!
14/2/24, 2:24 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Ok thank you
14/2/24, 2:24 PM - +263 78 835 4179: That is all I had to ask for now
14/2/24, 2:26 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
14/2/24, 2:26 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/2/24, 2:27 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Yes sure
14/2/24, 2:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let us connect in our next session which is tomorrow at the same time. See you!🚀
14/2/24, 2:39 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Ok thank you, have a nice day
