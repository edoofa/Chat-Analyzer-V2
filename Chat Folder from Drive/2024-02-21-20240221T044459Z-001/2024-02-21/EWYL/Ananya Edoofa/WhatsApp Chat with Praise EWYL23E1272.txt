13/2/24, 9:21 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
13/2/24, 9:27 AM - +263 78 789 9505: No ma'am I don't understand. Can you please share with me.
13/2/24, 9:29 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let us discuss this further tomorrow at the same time.

Remember that your consistency is something that will earn you credits here, so be regular, and trust me, no one can stop you from being at the top! All the best, good day! 🚀
13/2/24, 9:30 AM - +263 78 789 9505: Have a blessed day. Thank you.
14/2/24, 8:41 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Praise!

How are you doing? Are you ready for the session?🚀
14/2/24, 8:49 AM - +263 78 789 9505: Morning ma'am. I'm doing good. How are you ?
14/2/24, 8:49 AM - +263 78 789 9505: Yes ma'am,I'm ready for the session
14/2/24, 8:51 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
14/2/24, 8:51 AM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
14/2/24, 8:56 AM - +263 78 789 9505: Okay ma'am,I understand
14/2/24, 8:59 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
14/2/24, 9:02 AM - +263 78 789 9505: Okay ma'am
14/2/24, 9:14 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
14/2/24, 9:18 AM - +263 78 789 9505: Yes ma'am
14/2/24, 9:18 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
14/2/24, 9:19 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/2/24, 9:21 AM - +263 78 789 9505: Okay ma'am,let me read the newsletter
14/2/24, 9:24 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
14/2/24, 9:26 AM - +263 78 789 9505: Sounds interesting ma'am and I hope I will meet those goals.
14/2/24, 10:03 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to move ahead with our session; something urgent came up that required my immediate attention. Now that our session time is over, let us connect tomorrow at the same time.
14/2/24, 10:04 AM - +263 78 789 9505: Okay ma'am. Have a good day.

The past three days flew by in a whirlwind for Team Edoofa – both for those in India and those in Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. Now that we've had a chance to catch our breath, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success.

Your insights from the event are highly valued, and I'm keen to hear about your experience. Would you be open to sharing your thoughts, including your interest in attending similar events in the future and any suggestions for improvement? Additionally, if you have captured any memorable moments in photos, we would greatly appreciate you sharing them.

I was also happy to meet with Mr Keshav who was my counsellor. I have learnt that Edoofa is a good scholarship program through the videos which were played on the projector. Other students who are already in India were sharing with us their experiences through their journey with Edoofa and it was quite impressive.
