23/1/24, 9:15 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *_🌟 URGENT UPDATE 🌟_*

Nokutenda, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

In light of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. *Today, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable* and I am confident that together, we will create something truly extraordinary.
23/1/24, 9:43 AM - +263 78 272 0741: I appreciate ma'am and l would be glad to be of help hence l volunteer

As the month is ending, I've been evaluating the performance of my students, and I noticed that you have made decent progress this month by sharing 18 offline application forms with me.

I understand that we haven't been connecting through our sessions lately; however, as your mentor, my priority is your progress, and I don't want you to compromise on that. Therefore, I have taken out some time specifically for you so that we can have a conversation about your progress.

So, tell me, what is your progress? What are your plans to achieve the target of the month? Are you facing any challenges?
30/1/24, 10:28 AM - +263 78 272 0741: My plans to achieve the target of the month are to visit as many schools as l can and to interact with as many students as l can connect with.Also to make sure that the magnificent offers of Edoofa are known and spread to all the corners of my town ma'am.

The pictures are so good and I am so happy to see you!

The past three days flew by in a whirlwind for Team Edoofa – both for those in India and those in Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. Now that we've had a chance to catch our breath, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success.

Your insights from the event are highly valued, and I'm keen to hear about your experience. Would you be open to sharing your thoughts, including your interest in attending similar events in the future and any suggestions for improvement? Additionally, if you have captured any memorable moments in photos, we would greatly appreciate you sharing them.

Your perspective is crucial, and I also encourage you to discuss the event with your parents and gather their feedback.🌟
20/2/24, 2:28 PM - +263 78 272 0741: Good afternoon ma'am

Indeed the past 3 days flew like whirlwind and l'm really grateful to the team for organizing such a magnificent and motivating event.The past 3 days have been the best days of my life during this year and l'm grateful for the opportunity you gave me and believing in me l'm really grateful.

I'd like to share with you my insights and experiences right now....Well the event was a great one as we got to know more about Edoofa and our friends who're already in India the sessions were emotional especially for us knowing that being an Edoofian and coming from the Edoofian background we have parents in forms of mentors.Over this short period of time we had created an unbreakable bond with the team which l believe will keep on growing as time goes on.

I also got to know about the Slice con 24 which was held in January and how the entrepreneurs are willing to invest in Africa and how students also got the opportunity to showcase their talents.Oh and l almost forgot we got to learn about AI and how it's developing human lives everyday.

And not to forget the experience we had interacting with other Edoofians, students and parents who came for the event we got to learn a lot ,teamwork, hardwork, dedication,time management, patience and commitment over these past few days hence it was a great session and event we appreciate the opportunity you gave us.

As for my mother we're actually going there for the summit as she wasn't able to attend yesterday

Your excited student
