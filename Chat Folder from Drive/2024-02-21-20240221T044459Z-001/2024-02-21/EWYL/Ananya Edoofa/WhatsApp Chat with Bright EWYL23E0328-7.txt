26/12/23, 8:35 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Bright!

I hope you all had a wonderful holiday break. Before we dive into today's lesson, I'd love to hear about how your Christmas was. Did you do anything special or have any interesting experiences you'd like to share?
26/12/23, 8:37 AM - +263 78 714 6032: Good morning.
26/12/23, 8:38 AM - +263 78 714 6032: I spent the whole day with my family, nothing special.
26/12/23, 8:42 AM - Ananya Edoofa: That's amazing! It's really good to spend some quality time with your parents! 🌟
26/12/23, 8:46 AM - +263 78 714 6032: Of course.
26/12/23, 8:48 AM - Ananya Edoofa: So, may I ask if you were able to listen to the audio I share with you during our last session?
26/12/23, 8:49 AM - +263 78 714 6032: I was.
26/12/23, 8:52 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
26/12/23, 9:07 AM - +263 78 714 6032: Audio two is about the community building project. In this project I shall be identifying people that are highly academically oriented and are willing to study abroad. Then I shall ask them to consult their parents if they can apply or not.
26/12/23, 9:07 AM - Ananya Edoofa: That’s awesome Bright, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.
26/12/23, 9:08 AM - Ananya Edoofa: 1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

26/12/23, 9:09 AM - +263 78 714 6032: Thank you.
26/12/23, 9:14 AM - Ananya Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
26/12/23, 9:17 AM - +263 78 714 6032: Wow !
26/12/23, 9:17 AM - +263 78 714 6032: That sounds awesome !
26/12/23, 9:22 AM - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
26/12/23, 9:23 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
26/12/23, 9:23 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
26/12/23, 9:23 AM - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
26/12/23, 9:23 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
26/12/23, 9:23 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
26/12/23, 9:23 AM - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

26/12/23, 9:31 AM - +263 78 714 6032: Understood.
26/12/23, 9:32 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, let us conclude our today's session with our weekly newsletter! So, get ready to be inspired! <This message was edited>
26/12/23, 9:32 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 8:30 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Bright What did one wall say to the other wall?

I'll meet you at the corner!' Now that we've built a little humor, let's construct some great ideas in today's session.😄
27/12/23, 8:32 AM - +263 78 714 6032: Sure.
27/12/23, 8:34 AM - Ananya Edoofa: How are you Bright?
27/12/23, 8:36 AM - +263 78 714 6032: I am doing great, thanks for asking.
27/12/23, 8:38 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, in order to move ahead with your second project, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
27/12/23, 8:38 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
27/12/23, 8:39 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 8:39 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:
27/12/23, 8:39 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
27/12/23, 8:39 AM - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
27/12/23, 8:39 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
27/12/23, 8:39 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
27/12/23, 8:39 AM - +263 78 714 6032: How are you doing today ma'am?
27/12/23, 8:39 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.

27/12/23, 8:52 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 9:07 AM - +263 78 714 6032: The audio talks about the last project, which is the African schools education reform mission, which is said to be a student favourite. As part of the project I shall reach out to schools in my region and speak to the principals and head masters and inform them about the Edoofa program. After that I should try to arrange a meeting between the Edoofa program director and the principals of the schools.
27/12/23, 9:08 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay great, now allow me to recap this project quickly for you in 2 steps:

​​
27/12/23, 9:08 AM - Ananya Edoofa: ​After that, you will share in details about the program with the principals and ask them if you can schedule a call with the Edooa program Director so that the students of their school can also achieve the same.
27/12/23, 9:08 AM - Ananya Edoofa: After the school authorities respond to your message and you can set up our meeting with them, you can ask them about the date and the time when they would be available.

28/12/23, 8:35 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Bright!

As we embark on today's session, I'd like to set a positive tone with a motivating quote:

"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that count." - Winston Churchill

Let's approach our work today with determination and a mindset geared towards progress. Together, we can achieve great things. Looking forward to a productive and inspiring session!🚀
28/12/23, 8:36 AM - +263 78 714 6032: Good morning and thank you for the quote ma'am.
28/12/23, 8:38 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, now that your school is already partnered with us, I would like you to connect with other School Heads. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all other fellow school students as well.
28/12/23, 8:39 AM - +263 78 714 6032: Yes ma'am.
28/12/23, 8:40 AM - Ananya Edoofa: May I know if you have the other School Head’s Whatsapp Contact? And if not I suggest you find it Today so we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for other School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
28/12/23, 8:47 AM - +263 78 714 6032: I do not have other school head's Whatsapp contact at the moment, but I shall look for them.
28/12/23, 8:50 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright! Now, we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
28/12/23, 9:01 AM - +263 78 714 6032: So like, in the second project do I first create a group and add everyone that wants to know about the Edoofa program?
28/12/23, 9:02 AM - +263 78 714 6032: And then give them that offline form in the group or through their inboxes?
28/12/23, 9:05 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Absolutely!
28/12/23, 9:10 AM - +263 78 714 6032: After creating the group do I add you or I must explain to them before adding you
28/12/23, 9:10 AM - +263 78 714 6032: ?
28/12/23, 9:14 AM - Ananya Edoofa: You have to explain them everything, I will just monitor the group.
28/12/23, 9:17 AM - +263 78 714 6032: Okay, thank you.

1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
28/12/23, 9:21 AM - +263 78 714 6032: Understood.
28/12/23, 9:23 AM - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.

SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
28/12/23, 9:23 AM - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
28/12/23, 9:26 AM - +263 78 714 6032: Understood
28/12/23, 9:26 AM - Ananya Edoofa: As we conclude our session today, reflect on the progress you've made and the insights gained. If there's anything specific you'd like to focus on in our future sessions, feel free to share. Wishing you continued success and looking forward to our next session! 🌟

Wishing you a year ahead filled with love, prosperity, and the fulfillment of your heart's desires. May every day be a chance for you to shine and make a positive impact. ✨

Happy New Year in advance! 🎊

8/1/24, 9:27 AM - +263 78 714 6032: Good morning.
11/1/24, 10:10 AM - Ananya Edoofa: A lovely morning to you, Bright!

Kindly excuse me for the short delay. I wanted to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that was going on for the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! You know, it was so happening, and I am happy to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only this, but we also welcomed various industrial leaders, and it went super well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech made easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us as well. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.
11/1/24, 10:15 AM - +263 78 714 6032: Thank you for sharing with me.
11/1/24, 10:16 AM - +263 78 714 6032: I am happy to hear that it went super well.

11/1/24, 11:46 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Indeed! Now, I know it took me some extra time to find the pictures for you, and our session could not take place. We shall now resume our session on Monday. Meanwhile, I want you to follow your EWYL ritual daily so that you can receive the weekend activity.

Not only this but since this week is completely off for you, I want to know your progress with your projects. You know, seeing over 400 students in this event has motivated me to work for my students even harder. I want you to be here in India and pay your fee all by yourself. For this, I promise to assist you in every manner and make you feel like a proud Edoofian! To achieve this, you should take some baby steps and have a lot of faith in yourself to proceed with a big goal. You have limited time, start utilizing your weekend and set yourself a target. For example, you can set a goal of connecting with 5 students and be determined that you will reach this number and share the application forms with me by Monday. After that, you should always connect with me for a review so that you can evaluate and redefine your target. By the way, have you taken feedback from me earlier?
11/1/24, 11:52 AM - +263 78 714 6032: Thank you.
11/1/24, 11:52 AM - +263 78 714 6032: I haven't.

22/1/24, 12:04 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Bright!

I hope you are doing well. It's a new week, and I'm eager to connect with you on your EWYL line. Please join your EWYL line to proceed with our session!
24/1/24, 10:57 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *_🌟 URGENT UPDATE 🌟_*

Bright, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

Because of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. *As of now, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable*. Meanwhile, you can keep working on your targets and keep me posted on your EWYL group.
24/1/24, 3:15 PM - +263 78 714 6032: Understood.
24/1/24, 3:16 PM - +263 78 714 6032: Am I allowed to volunteer too ? <This message was edited>
