31/1/24, 4:33 PM - +263 71 256 8023: I'm sorry but l go to school from Monday to Friday and school ends at 1530 so l will  reach home at 1630 .l am sorry if l am causing any difficulties but we are not allowed to bring cellphones at school .

1/2/24, 2:13 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Kundai, I understand about your school timings however it is crucial for you to finish your EWYL orientation with me, as mentioned earlier. If you are not able to do that, you can ask your parents to attend the session with me and understand the basics of the program.

This will ensure a smooth process, and we can later connect on the projects only. Please let me know if you proceed in this manner.
1/2/24, 4:29 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Yes , we can proceed .My parents can be in touch with you
2/2/24, 1:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Kundai!

That's great! So, shall we begin ?
2/2/24, 2:56 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I was hoping for a response, however, since our session time is over, let's connect on Monday as we don't have sessions over the weekend!

Happy weekend!🚀
2/2/24, 4:29 PM - +263 71 256 8023: I'm sorry for the late response, l was at school . Have a great weekend
5/2/24, 1:31 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Kundai!

Let us begin our session with an amazing fact! 

_*Did you know that a day on Venus is actually longer than a year on Venus? Even though it only takes Venus about 225 Earth days to go around the sun, it spins really slowly, taking about 243 Earth days to turn once on its axis. So, a day on Venus is longer than a whole year there! 🫨*_
5/2/24, 2:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Kundai, I was expecting a response from your end, may I ask why didn't you attend your session?
5/2/24, 3:38 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Good afternoon, lm sorry ,l was at school
5/2/24, 3:59 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Mercy, While I understand that you are attending your school, however  it is crucial for you to finish your EWYL orientation with me, as mentioned earlier. If you are not able to do that, you can ask your parents to attend the session with me and understand the basics of the program.

This will ensure a smooth process, and we can later connect on the projects only. Please let me know if you proceed in this manner.
5/2/24, 4:34 PM - +263 71 256 8023: I'm sorry ma'am, l will do better next time
5/2/24, 4:39 PM - Ananya Edoofa: That's alright, Kundai! I can understand, I am therefore suggesting you to talk to your parents if they can attend your orientation program with me.
5/2/24, 4:51 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Ok ma'am  ,l will talk to them
6/2/24, 8:21 AM - +263 77 242 6991: How are you doing Ananya. I can have a session with you at 1000hrs on behalf of Kundai that is if you are free.
6/2/24, 10:37 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 10:47 AM - +263 77 242 6991: Ok let's have the session at 1330 hrs.
6/2/24, 1:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon,Kundai!

How are you doing? Are you ready for your session?🚀
6/2/24, 2:00 PM - +263 77 242 6991: Good afternoon. I am Kundai's father.Yes I am ready
6/2/24, 2:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: How are you, @263772426991 ?
6/2/24, 2:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
6/2/24, 2:03 PM - +263 77 242 6991: You can explain to me the key objectives.
6/2/24, 2:10 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
6/2/24, 2:10 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
6/2/24, 2:16 PM - +263 77 242 6991: Well explained. I now understand the two objectives
6/2/24, 2:25 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
6/2/24, 2:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, now that our session time is over, let us connect in our next session which is tomorrow at the same time. 🚀
6/2/24, 2:33 PM - +263 77 242 6991: Ok have a nice day
7/2/24, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Kundai!

Let us begin our session with a fact about elephants: Did you know that elephants are one of the few animals that can recognize themselves in a mirror? This ability indicates a level of self-awareness that is rare in the animal kingdom and suggests that elephants have a complex understanding of themselves and their surroundings. 🐘
7/2/24, 2:09 PM - +263 77 260 7270: Good afternoon , l am Kundai's mother , she's at school
7/2/24, 2:18 PM - Ananya Edoofa: That's alright. Shall we move ahead?
7/2/24, 2:18 PM - +263 77 260 7270: Yes please
7/2/24, 2:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
7/2/24, 2:25 PM - +263 77 260 7270: Yes it sounds interesting
7/2/24, 2:27 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
7/2/24, 2:28 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
