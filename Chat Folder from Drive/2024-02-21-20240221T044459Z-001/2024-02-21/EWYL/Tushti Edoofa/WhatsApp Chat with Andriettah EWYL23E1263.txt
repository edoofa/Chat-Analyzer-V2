While we were having multiple conversations with our students in the past few days for the meet & greet event, we figured that there is a slight confusion in the invitation dates. Hence, I wanted to quickly reach out and ensure that the same is not the case with you.

- As per the invitation, *you* are supposed to attend the event along with your parents on *17th of February* which is tomorrow. 
- If you are recommending any of *your friends (Non-Edoofians)* along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for *18th of February (8am/1pm) or 19th  February (1pm)*. They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event.
16/2/24, 4:02 PM - Tushti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/2/24, 4:02 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Please ensure that you are present at the venue 30 minutes earlier and are dressed appropriately.
Don't forget to carry your admit card!

Cannot wait to see you there tomorrow! Hope you're excited too! 😃🕺🏻
17/2/24, 6:07 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Good Evening Andriettah,

As our team engages with Edoofians and parents at today's meet & greet event in Harare, I couldn't help but notice your absence. We were truly looking forward to connecting with you and your family, and exploring the many growth opportunities that Edoofa offers.

Could you please share why you and your parents couldn't attend?
17/2/24, 6:12 PM - +263 71 614 6798: Good evening
I am located in Bulawayo and l got to know about this event not so long ago and also we were faced with financial challenges plus my parents are not in Zimbabwe at the moment
