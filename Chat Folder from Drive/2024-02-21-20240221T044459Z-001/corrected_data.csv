73 - 20 Feb 2024 02:39PM - +263 78 041 2990: Firstly l wanna say thank you for organizing such a vibrant event and allowing us the Proud Edoofian to be part of it. Personally l learnt a lot and all of the questions l had were answered honestly. The auditorium was full with parents and students and we got the chance to interact with the Edoofa team. We learnt a lot from Mr Angad's presentation and l was motivated too. The great part of the event was when we were shown long video presentation of that Event called the Slice_Con24 where we saw the joyous faces of the Proud Edoofians in India. Their time with affluent people from different industries and how they shared their experiences there in India. After seeing that video l could see myself already in India taking part in such events. It motivated me to work hard especially when l arrive in India and most of all to make a difference and make my community proud My suggestion is the Edoofa team should continue organizing such events for students especially so that they get clarity on whatever questions they will be having.l captured some memorable moments in pictures with Mr Angad and l even captured video presentation of Mr Angad

While we had Tiriwashe Mandota, an Edoofian who has already gotten his degree and is now Zimbabwe based, share his experience, some parents mentioned that it wasn't enough and wanted to speak to someone who is currently studying in India, to give a more 'recent' idea of the situation and stuff
187 - 20 Feb 2024 02:50PM - Ananya Edoofa: Thank you immensely for your kind words and glowing feedback! We're thrilled to hear that your experience as the MC for our recent events was nothing short of fantastic. It's heartwarming to know that you found the opportunity to hone your social interaction skills, connect with fellow Edoofians, and build relationships with our team members so rewarding.  Your suggestion to diversify our event locations to include cities like Mutare, Masvingo, Marondera, and Kwekwe is truly insightful. We wholeheartedly agree that expanding our reach to these areas will make our events more accessible and allow us to connect with even more individuals who could benefit from the opportunities we offer.

271 - 20 Feb 2024 01:23PM - +263 71 616 0258: Yes i attended the event yesterday and it was quite amazing. I got the chance to visualize my self in India through watching Videos of the Edoofians that side. The best part wch increased my security was hearing that Edoofa is connected to the biggest business men around India and some parts of the world, they aren't just meant to help us get Educated but also give us job opportunities since being an Edoofian will elevate one's status and their names will be much more favorable. This abolishes situations whereby most of my fellow Zimbabweans who study at home yet by the end of 4 years of their studies, they get nothing... But just a piece of paper (degree).Thanks to Edoofa by giving us employability opportunities.  As for improvements : Please i know to cater food for over 300 people might be expensive and all that but yohhhhhh the food was too expensive. We got a plate of sadza(our staple food) going at $2 each and that was too much.üôå  I don't know if it is possible that next time on big events, please provide free food for everyone. Or let me say candidates only at least.  As for my parents, they did not make it to the event, they were a bit busy.  All in all, honestly the event was amazing. Keep on hosting such events and i promise that the name of Edoofa will become something big.
272 - 20 Feb 2024 02:57PM - Ananya Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your experience at yesterday's event. It's fantastic to hear that you found it amazing and that you were able to visualize yourself in India through the videos of Edoofians there. Knowing that Edoofa is connected to influential businessmen in India and around the world must have been reassuring, as it opens up not just educational opportunities but also potential job prospects, elevating your status and opportunities for success.  Your feedback on the catering is noted, and I appreciate your honesty. We understand the importance of providing sustenance during events, especially for such a large gathering. We'll take your suggestion into consideration for future events, aiming to either provide free food for all attendees or at least for the candidates.

While we were having multiple conversations with our students in the past few days for the meet & greet event, we figured that there is a slight confusion in the invitation dates. Hence, I wanted to quickly reach out and ensure that the same is not the case with you.  - As per the invitation, *you* are supposed to attend the event along with your parents on *17th of February* which is tomorrow. - If you are recommending any of *your friends (Non-Edoofians)* along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for *18th of February (8am/1pm) or 19th  February (1pm)*. They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event.

Learnt a lot about Edoofa that l didn‚Äôt before how much of a big impact it is doing for many kids in Zimbabwe and africa as a whole.  The opportunity to meet the CEO of some of the big companies in India and be able to present  in front of them is in itself a blessing .   Am l disappointed with myself as l could have done more to be part of the organization team . I hope in the near future l can be able to participate  helping in any way l can .  The testimony of that guy who spent 6 years in India was really moving to see that he is now able to give back the knowledge he learnt to Zimbabwe it is something special .  Cant wait to start of my Education .  Than you team for such a whole sum experience.   Am a proud EDOOFIAN  and it is my blood .  Thank you

1 hr 6 mins","309 - 20 Feb 2024 10:26AM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
310 - 20 Feb 2024 10:27AM - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on February 29, 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
311 - 20 Feb 2024 10:28AM - +263 77 264 6599: Yes
312 - 20 Feb 2024 10:29AM - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
313 - 20 Feb 2024 10:31AM - +263 77 264 6599: Well done ,yes  explain please
314 - 20 Feb 2024 10:50AM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. As the amount needed for the registration fee is $750, this $750 can be conveniently paid in two instalments as outlined below:  1. An initial payment of *$375 before the first deadline date of 29th February, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).  2. A subsequent payment of *$375  before the second deadline date of 29th March, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
315 - 20 Feb 2024 10:50AM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $750 within 15 working days, before *February 29th, 2024*.  I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
316 - 20 Feb 2024 10:54AM - +263 77 264 6599: Yes we are opting to  pay$375  on the 27th of feb then the other 375 on the 27 of march
317 - 20 Feb 2024 10:57AM - +263 77 264 6599: So does the $375 have additional  charges
318 - 20 Feb 2024 10:59AM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment -  The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
336 - 20 Feb 2024 11:33AM - Ashi Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
337 - 20 Feb 2024 11:35AM - +263 77 264 6599: Yes l understood everthing  from the conference
338 - 20 Feb 2024 11:40AM - Ashi Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.  With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.  This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
339 - 20 Feb 2024 11:43AM - +263 77 264 6599: Very advantageous  it helps us a lot  as parent
340 - 20 Feb 2024 11:54AM - +263 77 264 6599: We decided to her to stay at the compus so give  the breakdown ,sorry
341 - 20 Feb 2024 01:00PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure please, You will be assisted regarding the accommodation before your arrival don't worry
342 - 20 Feb 2024 01:00PM - Ashi Edoofa: May I know when are you planning to pay the registration fees ?
343 - 20 Feb 2024 01:28PM - +263 77 264 6599: I arranged with mr Rajan to meet on saturday   10:00am

104 - 20 Feb 2024 09:52AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder‚Äôs office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa‚Äôs vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
105 - 20 Feb 2024 09:52AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you‚Äôve chosen that particular course and why you‚Äôre seeking admission in that particular school.
106 - 20 Feb 2024 09:52AM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear.
107 - 20 Feb 2024 09:55AM - +263 71 781 6716: Yes they are clear thank you
108 - 20 Feb 2024 10:23AM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
109 - 20 Feb 2024 10:23AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
110 - 20 Feb 2024 10:23AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa‚Äôs recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
111 - 20 Feb 2024 10:23AM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
112 - 20 Feb 2024 10:24AM - +263 71 781 6716: ü™¢yes I'm following
114 - 20 Feb 2024 10:26AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
115 - 20 Feb 2024 10:26AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
116 - 20 Feb 2024 10:26AM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
117 - 20 Feb 2024 10:32AM - +263 71 781 6716: ü™¢ everything is clear
118 - 20 Feb 2024 10:33AM - +263 71 781 6716: Are the documents I sent you  enough <This message was edited>
119 - 20 Feb 2024 10:54AM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes dear
120 - 20 Feb 2024 10:54AM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder‚Äôs office*?
121 - 20 Feb 2024 10:56AM - +263 71 781 6716: ü™¢thank you
122 - 20 Feb 2024 10:56AM - +263 71 781 6716: ü™¢ yes we can start
123 - 20 Feb 2024 10:58AM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life.  They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
147 - 20 Feb 2024 01:18PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*  The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
148 - 20 Feb 2024 01:18PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success.  I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
149 - 20 Feb 2024 01:22PM - +263 71 781 6716: Yes I agree
150 - 20 Feb 2024 01:23PM - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
151 - 20 Feb 2024 01:25PM - +263 71 781 6716: Yes we are on the same  page
152 - 20 Feb 2024 02:07PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
153 - 20 Feb 2024 02:07PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.  https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2

An example from my life which shows my managerial talent or skill is when I was a prefect at school. I was able to manage that time that other students in my class were supposed to be in class . I was able to make sure that the  classroom was tidy before and after school .Also , I'm the first born in a family of 3 children. So I am able to manage and see how my siblings are participating at school and assisting them on doing house chore . Some times my parents my leave the house to attend business meetings or family gatherings . I will be the one to manage the security and the day to day occasions at home.  5. The Human resources department is often considered to be one of the most important departments in an organizations . There are a  number of reasons for this.  HR is responsible for attracting and retaining the best talent, which is crucial .for any organisation's success.

Like i have said before ,he is self-employed, and his basic income has not been quite enough to cater to all the family needs,and he believes his pockets might not go with the fee structure. In as much as the scholarship offer of 50% was on ,the fees are still unaffordable to him.

He says if it was in the range of 800-1000 ,he would go through thick and thin to squeeze up in order to support my dream. <This message was edited>

273 - 20 Feb 2024 12:39PM - +263 77 709 8241: The challenge now comes to the financial side for my parents ,i was in a conversation with my father who has been supporting my educational life all along,we were discussing on my tertiary education and of course the EDOOFA scholarship program got to be involved in our discussions.  Even though he has been so enthusiastic about the program, paid some of the money required, and believes that learning abroad comes with its benefits, he complained that his pockets might not allow us to take this pathway.Him being a father of 6 ,i being the second child ,there's a lot already on his shoulders.

So yesterday after meeting with Vilsha, the Head of Admissions, Bethel decided to undertake the Diploma in Computer Engineering at Galgotias University with a registration fee of $750.00  We had paid an initial deposit of $500.00 giving us a balance of $250.00  Now Vilsha gave us a discount of $100.00 on condition that we pay by the 20st of February which is tomorrow.  This means the amount due was $150.00 which we paid as $155.00 and the $10.00 is the rate given by Mr Rajan.

254 - 20 Feb 2024 11:20AM - +263 71 721 0669: How much all in all
255 - 20 Feb 2024 11:31AM - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
256 - 20 Feb 2024 11:31AM - Gurvinder: First, the cost of education without the scholarship is $6000-8000, Referring to this image let me re-explain the financial aspect of the program in 3 parts.  1. The Enrollment fee is $350 which includes application forms, statement of purpose, letter of recommendation, visa assistance, Earn While You Learn Program's training etc.  2. The Registration fee would be between $500-$1000, basically if you recall I did brief you after your university interaction with multiple universities, you would have to reserve your seat in 1 particular university you would have to pay a registration fee. Now usually Registration fee for a student is a separate expense altogether, however for an Edoofian it is considered a part of the first year's annual fee.  Say suppose, after the scholarship your fee is $2200, and you are being asked to pay $500 as a registration fee.  Now, being an Edoofa Applicant you have the privilege here of the registration fee being adjusted against your Tuition fee.  Hence the amount of $500 paid as registration fee will be waived off from your Fee and after that, the balance of ($2200-$500=$1700) has to be paid after coming to India in August/September of the year you come in 2 installments. The first part will be $1000 which you will pay in August 2024-25 and the remaining $700 in January 2025-26.  3. The Annual fee after the scholarship as discussed above would be between $2000-$3000, and this would include Accommodation, Food Expenses, and Basic University Expenses such as exam fees, Library Fee, and Lab Fee However if a student is able to clear the Eligibility Check test and Interview with over 90 marks, a student is eligible to get a 90% to 100% scholarship where the Annual fee after the scholarship would be between $1250-$1500, which would include Accommodation, Food Expenses, and Basic University Expenses such as exam fees, Library Fee,¬†and¬†Lab¬†Fee

259 - 20 Feb 2024 01:07PM - +263 71 667 4002: Yes we are
260 - 20 Feb 2024 01:23PM - Gurvinder: So @263717210669 , before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me  1. What is the name of the course that @263716674002 would be studying through the Edoofa Program?  2. In which country will your child be studying through the Edoofa program?  3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?  4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?  5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?  6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.  7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

138 - 20 Feb 2024 02:04PM - Gurvinder: That is really great Jakwi I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,  However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.  Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
139 - 20 Feb 2024 02:06PM - +263 78 110 6398: I will do sir.. It is my wish to change the world from traditional way of living to a modern way
140 - 20 Feb 2024 02:06PM - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
141 - 20 Feb 2024 02:11PM - +263 78 110 6398: It is because in Zimbabwe school fees and levies are very high and in Zimbabwe üáøüáº technology is very low of which my career needs countries like üáÆüá≥india because is advanced in technology
142 - 20 Feb 2024 02:28PM - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.  In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
143 - 20 Feb 2024 02:50PM - +263 78 110 6398: In countries like Zimbabwe, where the economy is struggling and the standard of living is low, people with computer application degrees can play a crucial role in helping to improve the situation. They can use their knowledge to develop computer applications that address some of the country's most pressing problems, such as poor health care and limited access to education. For example, an app could be created to allow doctors and patients to communicate remotely, or to provide educational materials to students who don't have access to I traditional schools. Even a small change like this can have a big impact on a country like Zimbabwe.
144 - 20 Feb 2024 02:51PM - +263 78 110 6398: I will help my country and the world
145 - 20 Feb 2024 02:51PM - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Jakwi, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you.

171 - 20 Feb 2024 02:07PM - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well.

173 - 20 Feb 2024 02:09PM - +263 78 007 1892: My network is a bit slow
174 - 20 Feb 2024 02:28PM - Gurvinder: Joana as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn‚Äôt given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
175 - 20 Feb 2024 02:32PM - +263 78 007 1892: $1500 to$2150
176 - 20 Feb 2024 02:33PM - Gurvinder: Exactly Joana, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.

15 - 20 Feb 2024 02:01PM - Gurvinder: Noted, please let him know that you are now having a counselling session with Mr Gurvinder.
16 - 20 Feb 2024 02:01PM - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the program?
20 - 20 Feb 2024 02:04PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
21 - 20 Feb 2024 02:04PM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert‚Äôs, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
22 - 20 Feb 2024 02:04PM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
23 - 20 Feb 2024 02:11PM - +263 78 476 3627: Yes that is it Sir.
24 - 20 Feb 2024 02:12PM - +263 78 476 3627: Yes am familiar with some schools here ,am from rusape that is in manicaland and i did my A Level at St Faith's high
25 - 20 Feb 2024 02:28PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Luckmore, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
26 - 20 Feb 2024 02:33PM - +263 78 476 3627: Yes i can do but my parents are not online
27 - 20 Feb 2024 02:33PM - Gurvinder: Noted.

Rwanda was a devastated country it's basic structure was destroyed , millions of people were displaced and many surviving Tutsis had lost their families . Many women suffered the consequences of rape and sexual violence . Today Rwanda has rebuilt from the ashes of horrific tragedy . Rwanda's drive to rebuild it's economy after the genocide has been driven by three main sources which is the export of tea and coffee , foreign aid which constituted gross annual income and the tourism trade. After the genocide about thousands of refugees remained in exile. The economy of Rwanda has undergone rapid industrialization due to a successful governmental policy, it has a mixed economy. Countless survivors developed long term psychological problems. However, over time Rwanda rebuilt itself and survivors played an important role in it's development. Economically, it eeoded the country's ability to  attract private and external investment. However it has now made significant progress in stabilitising and rehabilitating it's economy. Over the years Rwanda noted the significant improvement in terms of access to utilities . Access to health care was also improving although there were disparities between urban and rural communities. The country has come farther than even the most optimistic observers would have predicted .All this development is important to recognize because It has been the governments policy to express policy to deliver basic services and economic growth to it's people in order to mitigate the genocide ideology .There were several  grenade attacks  in Kigali. There were ongoing complaints about democratic principles . Travelling was bound to be a bumpy ride . In the months leading to elections they had, independent and opposition  media outlets were banned and opposition candidates were harassed . Some where arrested and banned from taking part in election processes while others fled from the country . Presidents were only allowed to rule two seven year terms. Survivors reported that they had experienced on average twelve different types of traumatic event types in comparison to different types of  traumatic successors. Most reports were mainly linked to witnessing violence throughout the period of the genocide whereas other former prisoners emphasized being physically attacked referring to their time spent in refugee camps  or to imprisonment. A regression analysis of data of the parent generation revealed that the exposure to traumatic successors,the level of physical illness and the level of social intergration  were predictors of PTSD whereas economic status, age and gender were not. There were demonstrations of  particular long term  consequences of massive organized violence such as war and genocide , on mental health and psychological conditions. Differences between families of survivers and of prisoners were accused of participating in the genocide .
280 - 19 Feb 2024 07:00PM - +260 773617887: Section 6 MY INSPIRATIONAL STORY Somewhere in life ,we sometimes fail and we sometimes get hurt but there is always something or someone behind us who would inspire us to outshine ourselves in doing enormous things ,they are our inspiration in life ,our motivation and our strength to reach success. It has always been part of our life journey to encounter different challenges in life ,in every achievement, frustration and happiness our lives .My parents are always there by my side to guide and push me up, I am so frenzied and grateful for I have them  as my inspiration. To start ,my parents are a great gift in life ,I cannot imagine life without them ,Dr TP chia said "" parents love is the only love that is truly selfless , unconditional and forgiving."" They are very loving and care for me seeing them suffering while working too hard under the sun just to give me a nice future, inspires me . They are my role models and guide they give me courage to face battles and obstacles in life ,they have always been my biggest financial inspiration. Working tooth and nail until they achieve their goals. Being able to have them just lights up the stars for me . Further, my parents are my guide and give me courage to face obstacles in this life . My mother always smiles no matter what the circumstances are and that gives me the strength and inspiration to face all problems. My Father goes to the office but still does not forget to help me with my studies. They always encourage me in every aspect and motivate me even when I don't succeed. On top that , according to me if we have got the parents love then we've got the world's most expensive thing ,may God give me strength and power to take my parents name higher and higher In conclusion,my parents have made me understand what life is about and how to find that little ray of happiness in different situations. What I am today and what I will become in the future is only because of the support and affection of my parents,they have made me disciplined, dedicated and sincere because of this I am so inspired to study hard and more persevered in achieving all my dreams in life . Having a debt of gratitude to them ,I want to pay all their hard works by giving them a sufficient and marvelous life someday . <This message was edited>

I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly.

101 - 20 Feb 2024 12:26PM - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
102 - 20 Feb 2024 12:26PM - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
103 - 20 Feb 2024 12:27PM - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
157 - 20 Feb 2024 01:02PM - +263 77 937 8010: Correct
158 - 20 Feb 2024 01:03PM - Gurvinder: Alright Saizi, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
159 - 20 Feb 2024 01:04PM - +263 77 937 8010: Yes they are the ones
160 - 20 Feb 2024 01:05PM - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
161 - 20 Feb 2024 01:06PM - +263 77 937 8010: No haven't discussed in depth , l
162 - 20 Feb 2024 01:22PM - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.  Are you ready?
163 - 20 Feb 2024 01:26PM - +263 77 937 8010: Yes am ready
164 - 20 Feb 2024 01:26PM - Gurvinder: Saizi as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn‚Äôt given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
165 - 20 Feb 2024 01:27PM - +263 77 937 8010: Maximum of$2000
166 - 20 Feb 2024 01:29PM - Gurvinder: Exactly Saizi, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.",No,No

23 - 20 Feb 2024 11:21AM - Gurvinder: That is great, let me brief you more.
24 - 20 Feb 2024 11:21AM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
25 - 20 Feb 2024 11:21AM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
26 - 20 Feb 2024 11:21AM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert‚Äôs, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
27 - 20 Feb 2024 11:21AM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
30 - 20 Feb 2024 11:26AM - +263 77 319 7231: The situation in Zimbabwe right now is quite tense and a future is uncertain. Financial hardships have caused problems in my education but I am looking for a platform to bounce back from and you are the top recommended help I could find
31 - 20 Feb 2024 11:26AM - +263 77 319 7231: Please, pass my thanks to the brilliant minds who are constantly supporting your program
32 - 20 Feb 2024 11:35AM - Gurvinder: Okay so Mrs Shonani, as we start your son's counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
33 - 20 Feb 2024 11:36AM - +263 77 319 7231: Yes
34 - 20 Feb 2024 11:36AM - +263 77 319 7231: I am dedicated to getting whatever needs to be done and we both will be willing participants
35 - 20 Feb 2024 12:04PM - Gurvinder: Now Mrs Shonani, I would like to know Sithole better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about him, his career aspiration do include sharing about:-  1. His highest education level? 2. The course he would like to study? 3. What do you parents do? 4. What is the parent‚Äôs highest education level? 5. Who has been supporting him for his Education so far? 6. Who will be supporting him financially for his higher education abroad? 7. Does he have any siblings? if yes, what do they do? 8. May I know which school does he studies at and in which province is it located along with that how much was his per-term fee in A level?
36 - 20 Feb 2024 03:38PM - +263 77 319 7231: Anopaishe Brandon Sithole is a young man aged 19, determined and focused in his studies. From a young age, he seemed smart and always has a hands-on approach. His love for sciences started at young age with homemade simple machines and joining the Science Fair Team at both primary and secondary levels. Even though he is not going to school at the moment, he occupies himself with Civil Engineering books and Mechanical experiments and projects. Academically gifted in the Science Department, he attended his Ordinary Level studies at Nkululeko High School where he was a border. He wrote nine subjects including Physics, Biology and Chemistry. He passed all nine subjects and this is his highest level of education. He did attempt to write A level at Denmak Training Services, choosing Pure Mathematics, Physics and Geography. He failed dismally, due to the pressures of being a day scholar and got only 3 points. Denmak Training Services is located in Harare Province and the fees per term was 320USD. Both parents are of working class. The father is a primary grade teacher at Kuwadzana 4 Primary School and mother is a Patrolwoman in Harare City Council. Mr. Sithole's highest level of education is a diploma in motor mechanics and Mrs. Shonani's is Ordinary Level passes. Both the father and mother have been actively supporting his education providing for his fees and his daily needs. The couple will also be responsible for his finances abroad. They will be responsible for his person during the period of his stay. He is the first born of two, his younger sister is now in Grade 7 at K.I.P College. A bounce back is possible for the boy, as he has shown determination and willingness to persue Civil Engineering.
37 - 20 Feb 2024 03:41PM - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to know Brandon, Mrs Shonani.
38 - 20 Feb 2024 03:41PM - Gurvinder: So may I know, is he going to attempt his A-levels again or not?

Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!

16 - 20 Feb 2024 11:39AM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
17 - 20 Feb 2024 11:39AM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert‚Äôs, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
18 - 20 Feb 2024 11:39AM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‚Äò gather resolution from despair‚Äô but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.  1. The title that best suits the passage would be: a) The Change of Nature b) The Will to Fight c) Courage and Panic d) The Miracle of Confronting Danger  2.A man may react to sudden danger in three different ways . What are they? a) He may be paralyzed with fear, run away or fight. b) He may flee in panic, or fight back or stand still. c) He may be paralyzed with fear, or seized with panic, or as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, and face the danger. d) He may be paralyzed with fear, seized with panic or act like an inferior animal.  3.What is the meaning of the word debilitating ? a) enfeeble b) thriving c) strengthen d) debase  4. Explain the phrase ‚Äògather resolution from danger‚Äô. a) Find peace in times of difficulty. b) To remain calm and not to lose hope. c) A state of utter hopelessness makes one determined to face the difficulty. d) To be enthusiastic and brave the odds.  5. The author feels happy in the recollection of dangers faced and overcome because a) He felt elated as he was alive. b) They added a new perspective and lifted him above himself for a time. c) They brought him a new experience. d) These experiences boosted his confidence.  SECTION 3 LANGUAGE TEST  Each passage below is accompanied by a number of questions. For some questions, you will consider how the passage might be revised to improve the expression of ideas. For other questions, you will consider how the passage might be edited to correct errors in sentence structure, usage, or punctuation. A passage or a question may be accompanied by one or more graphics (such as a table or graph) that you will consider as you make revising and editing decisions. Some questions will direct you to an underlined portion of a passage. Other questions will direct you to a location in a passage or ask you to think about the passage as a whole. After reading each passage, choose the answer to each question that most effectively improves the quality of writing in the passage or that makes the passage conform to the conventions of standard written English.

Therefore  my wishes is that both rural and urban students must receive equal education with one language . The other thing to reach secondary level is not easy since there is  intersectorial barriers to boys and girls  and accessing education which includes household porvety , abuse and socio- cultural norms . Thus if l got the opportunity to became a journalist l will give the point of view to the society that education must be strengthening in our country and training skills to the teachers

120 - 20 Feb 2024 01:24PM - Pallika Edoofa: That‚Äôs alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.  In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.  With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process. This reduced cost includes: *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*",No,Yes

205 - 20 Feb 2024 04:01PM - Pallika Edoofa: Well, We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.  *Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.  *Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.  *Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.  *Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.  We are left with steps 5 and 6. So shall I explain them to you?

207 - 20 Feb 2024 04:18PM - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.  August 2025 intake applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.  This registration fee($500-$1000) isn‚Äôt an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year‚Äôs Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
208 - 20 Feb 2024 04:19PM - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6 :* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.  I hope you are clear with the process.
