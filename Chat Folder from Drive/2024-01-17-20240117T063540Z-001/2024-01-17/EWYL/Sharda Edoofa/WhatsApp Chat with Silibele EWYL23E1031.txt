16/1/24, 8:21 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *"Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much." - Helen Keller*

Good morning, Silibele! Helen Keller nailed it – teamwork is our superpower! 💥 Let's pool our skills and ideas to crush it today! 🚀 Excited for our session together! 🤝💪
16/1/24, 8:22 AM - +263 77 898 6737: Yes l am looking forward to it let's get tuned
16/1/24, 8:37 AM - Sharda Edoofa: I am glad to know that, Silibele. <This message was edited>
16/1/24, 8:37 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Great! So have you gone through the newsletter?
16/1/24, 8:37 AM - +263 77 898 6737: Yes l did
16/1/24, 8:44 AM - Sharda Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
16/1/24, 8:57 AM - +263 77 898 6737: Every day, we are faced with hundreds, if not thousands, of choices. The vast majority of
them are insignificant, unimportant, or both. Is it really necessary to have an entire aisle
dedicated to toothpaste?
Most of us employ a satisficing approach in response to all of these decisions, a term
coined by Nobel Laureate Herbert Simon to describe something that isn't perfect but
good enough. This is a smart technique for things that don't matter. You have no idea
which pizza joint is the greatest, but you do know which ones are adequate. Satisficing is
one of the pillars of productive human conduct; it prevails when we don't waste time on
insignificant decisions, or, more precisely, when we don't waste time trying to improve
things that won't make a major difference in our enjoyment or satisfacaction.

To conclude that l can say l am inspire to choose important things  in life and be happy with what l already have and invest it in such way that  l can create my own name with just little effort l put on my work.
16/1/24, 9:09 AM - +263 77 898 6737: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 9:28 AM - +263 77 898 6737: And also the Qoutes that Founder of the Edoofa scholarship program gave to the Edoofians inspired me a  for example one the quotes says (  Don’t limit yourself. Many people limit themselves to what they think they can do.
You can go as far as your mind lets you. What you believe, remember, you can
achieve.”– Mary Kay Ash, Founder Mary Kay Cosmetics
)....In this l have learned that you're allowed to scream ,shout and bang the doors but one thing l.know is that you're not allowed to Give up and there is of course morning wrong with having dreams and goals to pursue,however most of us don't stop to consider whether our self critical and competitive attitude is helping us to achieve these goals or it might my standing in our way and always know the difference between perfect and what's perfect for you because in this world no one is  perfect .(My biggest motivation? Just to keep challenging myself. I see life almost like one
long University education that I never had -- every day I’m learning something
new." - Richard Branson),it shows that Future is always brighter when you look beyond your status and success is inevitable when your determination is unquestionable.
16/1/24, 9:30 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, I totally agree with you. I would like to appreciate you for how beautifully, descriptively you have shared your understanding.
