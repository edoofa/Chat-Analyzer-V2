15/1/24, 8:33 AM - +263 77 302 5297: Good morning
15/1/24, 8:34 AM - +263 78 395 8654: Morning, we are fine
15/1/24, 8:35 AM - Sharda Edoofa: I am glad to know that.
15/1/24, 8:38 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
15/1/24, 8:45 AM - +263 78 395 8654: Am not quite sure
15/1/24, 8:52 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *Delight* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.

The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
15/1/24, 8:59 AM - +263 78 395 8654: Understood
15/1/24, 9:13 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*.
