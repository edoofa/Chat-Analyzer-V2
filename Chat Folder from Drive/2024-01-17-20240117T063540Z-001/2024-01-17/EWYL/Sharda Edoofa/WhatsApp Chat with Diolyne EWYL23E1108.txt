The scholarship is a great opportunity for me, and I would appreciate your understanding and consideration. Thank you for your time

15/1/24, 8:40 AM - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
15/1/24, 8:40 AM - Sharda Edoofa: 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
15/1/24, 8:40 AM - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
15/1/24, 8:40 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends

I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 

I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.

Best of Luck!
15/1/24, 8:41 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Is everything clear until now?

We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10,000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Here with I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.

15/1/24, 8:49 AM - Sharda Edoofa: PROJECT 3: AFRICAN SCHOOL EDUCATION REFORM MISSION PROJECT
15/1/24, 8:49 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Now we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
15/1/24, 8:49 AM - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/1/24, 8:51 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Ok
15/1/24, 8:51 AM - +263 78 997 2192: The group l created should have how many participants
15/1/24, 8:57 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Thank you
15/1/24, 9:12 AM - Sharda Edoofa: There is not any particular limit to the number of students in the group.
15/1/24, 9:13 AM - Sharda Edoofa: After you go through the audio, I would appreciate it if you could briefly share your understanding of the audio.
15/1/24, 9:13 AM - +263 78 997 2192: What about the minimum  number right now l have 30 participants
15/1/24, 9:19 AM - Sharda Edoofa: you can surely go ahead with 30.
15/1/24, 9:22 AM - +263 78 997 2192: I understood that l should make a list of schools in my local region and speak to the principals of the school  about edoofa and l will then arrange an online meeting of the principal with the Edoofa director and l will share the principals numbers in this group
15/1/24, 9:22 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Ok
15/1/24, 9:23 AM - +263 78 997 2192: https://chat.whatsapp.com/FpUnPrwJZc1JrO9FxpaRWv
15/1/24, 9:43 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Are we still continuing with the session
15/1/24, 10:22 AM - Sharda Edoofa: So, well written.
15/1/24, 10:22 AM - Sharda Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
15/1/24, 10:23 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Yes
15/1/24, 10:23 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
15/1/24, 10:24 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Yes
16/1/24, 8:20 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *"Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much." - Helen Keller*

16/1/24, 1:48 PM - +263 78 997 2192: Ok l understand
16/1/24, 1:48 PM - Sharda Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
16/1/24, 1:49 PM - Sharda Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
16/1/24, 1:49 PM - Sharda Edoofa: 1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

16/1/24, 1:59 PM - Sharda Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. It fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together.
16/1/24, 1:59 PM - Sharda Edoofa: The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
