If you have been following our messages, you might have come across read about *SLICE-CON'24 (Symposium of Leaders, Inventors, and Creators with Edoofa) – an Industrial Visit* curated especially for our students next week. 

The visit is a one-of-a-kind opportunity to connect with industry specialists and engage in workshops with CEOs, founders, and co-founders – an experience that goes beyond the classroom.
And here's the exciting part – *it's a fully funded event by Edoofa, ensuring your child's comfort from food to travel to stay.*

Your child has shared the confirmation of the official invitation that was sent from our end. *Were you aware of the same and what do you think about this?*

There is  a  student who sat for her Cambridge AS exams  (written at Form 5). Can she be considered for  Edoofa scholarship?
15/1/24, 2:14 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
Kindly excuse me for the delay in my response. Following the event, I experienced a fever and had to be on bed rest for a couple of days.

I hope you have settled back at your university after the extensive travel for our *SLICE-CON 24!*🚀

As your mentor, I am eager to hear your thoughts on the event and the opportunities that you have identified for the future. I am also particularly interested in learning about your preferences for future events and what topics you would like to explore. As a result, I am sharing a link to a feedback form here.🤝

🚨*Please note that the feedback form requires a passcode, and your passcode is:* 45
