*SLICE-CON'24*: The much-awaited Industrial visit is just around the corner! Drumrolls! 🥁
3/1/24, 6:58 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Here it is, the first poster that holds the answers to the many questions you've been asking about our upcoming industrial visit. 🌟
Have a look at the poster.
3/1/24, 6:58 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
3/1/24, 7:02 PM - +91 76965 03380: Great, I can't wait for the industrial visit.
3/1/24, 7:03 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: The prospect of hands-on learning is truly thrilling. Right?
How does the idea of a fully paid trip sound to you? Are you excited?
3/1/24, 7:04 PM - +91 76965 03380: I'm very excited about the idea.
3/1/24, 7:06 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: So, have you shared this trip with your parents?
3/1/24, 7:08 PM - +91 76965 03380: Yes I have but I wasn't sure about the dates but now I know.
3/1/24, 7:09 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Speaking about the Big Day, I can't hold back my excitement! I've spent my entire New Year getting things ready, especially planning my outfits. How about you? What are your expectations for the event? What kinds of events do you think there will be?

Wait, have you even filled out that RSVP?
3/1/24, 7:19 PM - +91 76965 03380: 😃 I am still making my preparations for the day.
I think there are going to be events like speeches and poem or such things like that maybe, but the best part of this trip that gives me goose bumps is getting to interact with other Edoofians from different Universities and most importantly the above mentioned CEO's of great start-ups
3/1/24, 7:20 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Have you had a chance to check out the poster? 
Are you familiar with the backgrounds and achievements of all three speakers?
3/1/24, 7:23 PM - +91 76965 03380: Yes I have seen the poster. I am only aware of the founder and CEO of Sirona Hygiene. But as for the background and achievements I am not quite aware.
3/1/24, 7:25 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now since it is time to wrap up the session. In the end. I'd like you to search for these three speakers on Google and familiarize yourself with their backgrounds. 
I am also sharing your Wednesday Lesson below. Make sure you go through it and share your understanding by Friday.

It was lovely talking to you. Have a great evening!

If you have been following our messages, you might have come across read about *SLICE-CON'24 (Symposium of Leaders, Inventors, and Creators with Edoofa) – an Industrial Visit* curated especially for our students next week. 

The visit is a one-of-a-kind opportunity to connect with industry specialists and engage in workshops with CEOs, founders, and co-founders – an experience that goes beyond the classroom.
And here's the exciting part – *it's a fully funded event by Edoofa, ensuring your child's comfort from food to travel to stay.*

Your child has shared the confirmation of the official invitation that was sent from our end. *Were you aware of the same and what do you think about this?*
6/1/24, 5:53 PM - +263 77 405 9907: Good afternoon sir/ or madam.Thank you for sharing this vital information.We  welcome this initiative and we would like our child to participate.However as you have said that this is fully funded by Edoofa,does it mean that  we don't require any financial input from us.
6/1/24, 9:24 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I am really happy to know this and I really appreciate your participation in Thomas's EWYL journey
Goodnight!
15/1/24, 2:15 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
Kindly excuse me for the delay in my response. Following the event, I experienced a fever and had to be on bed rest for a couple of days.

I hope you have settled back at your university after the extensive travel for our *SLICE-CON 24!*🚀

As your mentor, I am eager to hear your thoughts on the event and the opportunities that you have identified for the future. I am also particularly interested in learning about your preferences for future events and what topics you would like to explore. As a result, I am sharing a link to a feedback form here.🤝

🚨*Please note that the feedback form requires a passcode, and your passcode is:* 51

Kindly take the time to fill out the form thoughtfully!

16/1/24, 12:31 PM - +91 76965 03380: SLICE CON 24 was very helpful in my experience as it provided me with a larger insight on my career path and my journey to becoming a successful individual.
In future I would really appreciate the Fire side chat with CEOs like the one we did with Mr Bharat Sethi as it was very motivating.
