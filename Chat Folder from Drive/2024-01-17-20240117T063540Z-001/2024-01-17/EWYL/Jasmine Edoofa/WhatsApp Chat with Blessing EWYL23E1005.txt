29/12/23, 1:28 PM - +263 78 087 8756: good afternoon ma'am,l am here
29/12/23, 1:33 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Good Afternoon Blessing*_
Let us start today's session with a fun question -

If you could create a new country on any unclaimed land in the world, what would you name it, and what values or principles would be the foundation of your utopian society? <This message was edited>
29/12/23, 1:36 PM - +263 78 087 8756: 😂😂 so funny
29/12/23, 1:36 PM - +263 78 087 8756: What a fun thought experiment! If I could create a new country, I would name it "Utopia" and its founding values would be peace, equality, and sustainability. Utopia would be a peaceful and harmonious place, where people of all backgrounds and beliefs could coexist in harmony. The country would be founded on the principle of equality, with equal rights and opportunities for all citizens. Sustainability would be a key value, with a focus on protecting the environment and ensuring a clean and healthy future for generations to come. Though it will be illegal
29/12/23, 2:29 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Your vision of Utopia sounds like a truly idyllic and inclusive society! The emphasis on peace, equality, and sustainability reflects a deep commitment to creating a harmonious environment where everyone can thrive.
29/12/23, 2:29 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Good job, Blessing
29/12/23, 2:31 PM - +263 78 087 8756: thank you ma'am
29/12/23, 2:33 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Last time we were discussing Project 2
Do you remember?
29/12/23, 2:34 PM - +263 78 087 8756: yes ma'am
29/12/23, 2:42 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!

_Through WhatsApp community groups_
29/12/23, 2:43 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Kindly go through the audio that I am sharing below, After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you could briefly summarize your understanding of it.
29/12/23, 2:43 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 2:58 PM - +263 78 087 8756: I have to create a WhatsApp group and identify students who can be part of our group.l will have to provide an understanding of Edoofa before they go the counseling session making sure they get enough experience.I have to connect with students who are currently in form 6 or have passed it.l will have to join other groups with students who have educational goals and give them a link to my group
29/12/23, 2:59 PM - +263 78 087 8756: Once students share the group,l can share information to a larger audience
29/12/23, 3:03 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Well Done Blessing, I am impressed with your understanding.
29/12/23, 3:03 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
29/12/23, 3:05 PM - +263 78 087 8756: am ready for it
29/12/23, 3:05 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

29/12/23, 3:07 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 3:10 PM - +263 78 087 8756: I have to reach out to secondary schools in my region and inform them about Edoofa and my vision and objectives in future.I have to even include my former school and meet up with the headmaster.I will exchange contact details and arrange a video call between Edoofa team and school administrator
29/12/23, 3:16 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Now it is time to wrap up the session. As we are going to embark on a new chapter at the dawn of the New Year, I really wanted to send my warmest wishes your way. 
_May this coming year be filled with joy, laughter, and moments of profound happiness_ 🌈

Along with you, the Edoofa Family will also be occupied in *New Year Celebrations from tomorrow till 1 January 2024* and we will *resume from 2 January onwards*🎉

2/1/24, 2:31 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. It fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
2/1/24, 2:38 PM - +263 78 087 8756: ooh l understand

*Now, I will meet you in our next session*
Have a great evening!
3/1/24, 7:13 PM - +263 78 087 8756: okay ma'am
6/1/24, 4:03 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Good Afternoon my lovely student*_
I wanted to share some exciting news with you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 4:04 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. 

*When we connect on the 11th of January at 7::00 pm,* I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨

*Now, Since it will be a long break, I want you to work hard on the projects and submit 7 applications to me on Thursday.* 
Give it your 100% and I know you can do this. Take care
6/1/24, 10:23 PM - +263 78 087 8756: okay ma'am

15/1/24, 1:09 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good Afternoon_*
Kindly excuse me for the delay in my response. Following the event, I experienced a fever and had to be on bed rest for a couple of days.

Let me share the scoop on *Slice Con'24—it was seriously awesome!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️
15/1/24, 1:09 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Well, Done on sharing the form 🌟 
It has been shared with our dedicated counseling team. In the meantime, it is crucial that you maintain regular communication with the student and address any queries they may have. Our counseling team will be reaching out to them directly within the next 15-20 days.
