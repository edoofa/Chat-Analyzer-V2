5/1/24, 8:43 AM - +263 78 098 4146: Am 18

5/1/24, 8:56 AM - +263 78 098 4146: I support Manchester United
5/1/24, 8:58 AM - +263 78 098 4146: Higher education abroad through Edoofa i think would be a step to my success
5/1/24, 9:02 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Lovely!Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
5/1/24, 9:03 AM - +263 78 098 4146: What are they?
5/1/24, 9:06 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
5/1/24, 9:06 AM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
5/1/24, 9:09 AM - +263 78 098 4146: Understood clearly✅
5/1/24, 9:15 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
5/1/24, 9:17 AM - +263 78 098 4146: Noted
5/1/24, 9:18 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
5/1/24, 9:20 AM - +263 78 098 4146: Interesting indeed
5/1/24, 9:21 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
5/1/24, 9:21 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/1/24, 9:35 AM - +263 78 098 4146: Done✅

6/1/24, 1:28 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Perfect!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:28 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
6/1/24, 1:42 PM - +263 78 098 4146: That is great
6/1/24, 1:43 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Ok no problem
11/1/24, 11:26 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Perfect!

I hope you are doing well. Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you this morning. Actually, I was sorting out some pictures and videos for you. Let us do one thing, for today let us connect today at 1:30 pm and I will share a lot about our three-day event!

Is that alright?
11/1/24, 11:41 AM - +263 78 098 4146: Its ok
11/1/24, 1:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Before beginning our session, I want to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that took place over the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! It was so happening, and I am delighted to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only that, but we also hosted various industrial leaders, and it went exceptionally well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech Made Easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.
11/1/24, 2:08 PM - +263 78 098 4146: That's very nice i can see u had a wonderful experience

11/1/24, 2:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now,  I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
11/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Sound great and interesting too
11/1/24, 2:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
11/1/24, 2:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/1/24, 3:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your end, however since our session time is over, we shall connect in our next session.

Remember that your consistency is something that will make you achieve heights! So always attend your session on time, and trust me, no one can stop you from earning credits!

Therefore, good luck, and see you tomorrow!
11/1/24, 3:15 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Took long to finish understood though
11/1/24, 3:15 PM - +263 78 098 4146: See you
11/1/24, 3:19 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Maybe just a question for u to answer me before the next session


Does it matter which project i start with??
12/1/24, 8:36 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Perfect!

Let us begin our session with a fact! Did you know that the total weight of ants on Earth is comparable to the total weight of all the humans on this planet? It's a staggering reminder of the incredible diversity and abundance of life around us.🤯🐜
12/1/24, 8:37 AM - +263 78 098 4146: Really🙆🏽‍♂️ i didnt know that
12/1/24, 8:42 AM - Ananya Edoofa: No, Perfect!
12/1/24, 8:42 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
12/1/24, 8:42 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/1/24, 8:54 AM - +263 78 098 4146: Done
12/1/24, 9:01 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
12/1/24, 9:13 AM - +263 78 098 4146: Ok
So the first project aims to get familiar with the market u want to be in
There is also identification of companies in my country and connection with them then tell them about my enrollment in Edoofa program and the  how the program will help me aquire skills required in my area of interest
I'll also need a linkedin account to look for companies and their employees and connect with them
I'll have to contact managers,HR managers ,organisational heads and create contact between them and you
The process will help make me and my country grow through exploring my network and credibility wc will help with doing projects and jobs
12/1/24, 9:13 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing, Perfect. I’m happy with your understanding.
12/1/24, 9:13 AM - Ananya Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
12/1/24, 9:14 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/1/24, 9:29 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, we shall connect in our next session. Since we don't have sessions over the weekend, let's reconnect on Monday. See you then!🚀
12/1/24, 9:31 AM - +263 78 098 4146: So i learnt the company should be student centric,content centric or recreational in nature
Also should not be too big nor too small
Should be financially stable and the founder should have a solid background in terms of experience and qualifications
So i can find these companies through google or linked in
Before connecting with them i should understand them and their backgrounds through social media platforms ,studying their websites
12/1/24, 9:32 AM - +263 78 098 4146: Ok
15/1/24, 8:39 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Perfect!
