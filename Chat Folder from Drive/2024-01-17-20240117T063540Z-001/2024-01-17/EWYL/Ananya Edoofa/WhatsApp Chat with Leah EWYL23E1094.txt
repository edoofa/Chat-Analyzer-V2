5/1/24, 4:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, great! Well, kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you earlier. I was involved in a call with my students who will be presenting to prominent CEOs and entrepreneurs during a significant industrial visit scheduled for next week. Training them is crucial, especially since it's their first time participating in such an event.

We will reconnect in our next session, which is on Monday, as we do not hold sessions over the weekend. Meanwhile, I am sharing a video with you. Wishing you a happy weekend!
5/1/24, 4:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

I will surely watch the video 
Thank you, wishing you a happy weekend too.
6/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Leah!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
6/1/24, 3:56 PM - +263 77 821 9098: Waal noted ma'am <This message was edited>
6/1/24, 4:03 PM - +263 78 536 5920: Oh this is wonderful news 
Wishing you a great and fun visit. <This message was edited>
6/1/24, 4:03 PM - +263 78 536 5920: Noted with thanks ma’am
11/1/24, 1:41 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Leah!

Before beginning our session, I want to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that took place over the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! It was so happening, and I am delighted to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only that, but we also hosted various industrial leaders, and it went exceptionally well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech Made Easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.

11/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 77 821 9098: That's wonderful news you share with us thank you
11/1/24, 1:54 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?
11/1/24, 4:01 PM - +263 78 536 5920: Good day to you ma’am , I’m really sorry about not being able to respond to you earlier. Schools have opened so I had lessons throughout the day and I’m really sorry for not notifying you. My sincere apologies. <This message was edited>
11/1/24, 4:03 PM - +263 78 536 5920: Oh this is lovely and wonderful ma’am 
I can see that these proud Indian Edoofians really enjoyed the visit from the pictures you have sent.
11/1/24, 4:04 PM - +263 78 536 5920: My favorite hobbies are baking and singing.I love baking because I get to be creative in the kitchen and seeing how my recipes turn out. Plus, I love being able to share my creations with friends and family. It's a great way to show people how much I care about them. Also singing is a way for me to express myself and let out my emotions. It's like therapy for me, and it helps me relax and forget about my worries. I love the feeling of being totally immersed in a song and letting the music take over. Singing also gives me a sense of accomplishment and pride when I perform well.


Studying biology is my passion for it has opened my eyes to the amazing complexity and beauty of life on Earth. I've learned about the interconnectedness of all living things, and how everything is connected in some way. I've also gained a greater understanding of how my own body works, and what I can do to keep it healthy. 

One of my goals is being a biotechnologist, because I see the potential for it to make a real difference in the world. This field is helping solve on of the world’s biggest challenges like food security and developing ne treatments for diseases.I want to be part of the next generation of scientists who are using cutting-edge technologies to solve big problems. I know it will take hard work and dedication, but I'm ready to take on the challenge.



Thank you
12/1/24, 1:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Leah!

Let us begin our session with a fact! Did you know that the total weight of ants on Earth is comparable to the total weight of all the humans on this planet? It's a staggering reminder of the incredible diversity and abundance of life around us.🤯🐜
12/1/24, 2:24 PM - +263 78 536 5920: Afternoon, how are you doing this afternoon?

I didn’t know that but it’s just amazing.
12/1/24, 2:25 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Why are you late, Leah?
12/1/24, 2:25 PM - +263 78 536 5920: I’m sorry ma’am for being late.
I was at school just got home.
12/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I understand, however, I want to let you know that it is crucial for you to complete your orientation program with me. It would be great if you or your parents could attend the initial 4-5 sessions with me so that you can understand the outline of the program clearly.
12/1/24, 2:27 PM - +263 78 536 5920: That’s fine ma’am.
I think that will not be a problem 
Thank you
12/1/24, 2:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, we shall connect in our next session. Since we don't have sessions over the weekend, let's reconnect on Monday. See you then!🚀
12/1/24, 2:29 PM - +263 78 536 5920: Thank you ma’am will surely be available.

Have a great weekend
15/1/24, 1:31 PM - +263 78 536 5920: Afternoon ma’am, I am fine 
Hope you are doing great.

This is wondeful
15/1/24, 1:39 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, due to a technical glitch, I cannot access our last conversation. Could you please share a screenshot with me so that I can move forward?
15/1/24, 1:42 PM - +263 78 536 5920: <Media omitted>
15/1/24, 1:42 PM - +263 78 536 5920: <Media omitted>
15/1/24, 1:45 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
15/1/24, 1:47 PM - +263 78 536 5920: No ma’am
15/1/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
15/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
15/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 78 536 5920: I have understood the two key objectives. 
Thank you
15/1/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
15/1/24, 2:10 PM - +263 78 536 5920: That’s lovely , I can’t wait to work with them. 
Thank you ma’am for the introduction.
15/1/24, 2:12 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
15/1/24, 2:16 PM - +263 78 536 5920: Yes ma’am so interesting
15/1/24, 2:21 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
15/1/24, 2:21 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/1/24, 2:22 PM - +263 78 536 5920: Yes ma’am 20 minutes is enough 
Thank you
15/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
15/1/24, 2:29 PM - +263 78 536 5920: I’m sorry ma’am I’m not yet done I am at school so I’m facing some challenges. 
I have to attend a lesson now.
Will you please excuse me ma’am
15/1/24, 2:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright! Now let us conclude our session with a motivating quote : 

_Remember, every step forward counts, no matter how small. Embrace the challenges, for they are the stepping stones to success. Keep pushing, stay positive, and watch your journey unfold. You've got this!_🚀
15/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 78 536 5920: Thank you so much ma’am.
I really appreciate it
16/1/24, 1:29 PM - +263 78 536 5920: Good afternoon ma’am 
Hope you are doing well. 

Yesterday I managed to read the newsletter and from the newsletter, I found everything interesting especially how Nyasha is so inspirational. 
I also liked the three quotes and the questions, how they are just interesting.
16/1/24, 1:41 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Leah!

I hope you're all ready for a great session. Let's kick things off with a quick joke to lighten the mood:

Why did the math book look sad? Well, because it had too many problems! 😄
16/1/24, 1:49 PM - +263 78 536 5920: 🤣🤣
16/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 78 536 5920: I am ready but we have no electricity due to rains so my phone is running low on battery.
16/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, let us try to finish our session early!
16/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!

16/1/24, 1:56 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of.

16/1/24, 2:01 PM - +263 78 536 5920: Well is it possible to reschedule the time for our sessions?
16/1/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 2:05 PM - +263 78 536 5920: I understand ma’am but I’m facing challenges.
16/1/24, 2:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: What kind of challenges, Leah?
16/1/24, 2:13 PM - +263 78 536 5920: My school timetable has changed, some of my lessons are starting from 1350hrs to 1500hrs of which I have a session with you ma’am.

Thank you

16/1/24, 2:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let us conclude our session here, and remember, every effort you put in is a step closer to success.
