12/1/24, 8:37 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Nigel!

Let us begin our session with a fact! Did you know that the total weight of ants on Earth is comparable to the total weight of all the humans on this planet? It's a staggering reminder of the incredible diversity and abundance of life around us.🤯🐜
12/1/24, 8:38 AM - +263 71 226 7257: Iam fine how are you this morning
12/1/24, 8:43 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing good.

12/1/24, 8:54 AM - +263 71 226 7257: Ok,My name is Nigel Tinodaishe Marowa,lam aged 19 and l recently wrote mu Alevel examinations.On my free l enjoy singing and reading. My goals are to get higher quality education and start my own businesses
12/1/24, 9:03 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Singing and reading in your free time? Amazing hobbies. What's your favorite genre to sing?
12/1/24, 9:12 AM - +263 71 226 7257: I don't have a specific genre l like all genre
12/1/24, 9:13 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
12/1/24, 9:15 AM - +263 71 226 7257: No l don't
12/1/24, 9:17 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
12/1/24, 9:17 AM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
12/1/24, 9:20 AM - +263 71 226 7257: Ok
12/1/24, 9:22 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
12/1/24, 9:25 AM - +263 71 226 7257: Ok thats amazing
12/1/24, 9:29 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, we shall connect in our next session. Since we don't have sessions over the weekend, let's reconnect on Monday. See you then!🚀
12/1/24, 9:38 AM - +263 71 226 7257: Ok take care
15/1/24, 8:38 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Nigel!

Hwoa re you doing today? I'm excited to share that we have beautifully decorated the walls of our office gallery! The space now reflects creativity and inspiration. I am so excited to add our photo here as well!🚀🤝🏽
15/1/24, 8:38 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/1/24, 9:00 AM - +263 71 226 7257: Oooh thats amazing
15/1/24, 9:08 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Why are you late, Nigel?
15/1/24, 9:14 AM - +263 71 226 7257: Iam sorry l was a little busy with something but now lam now available
15/1/24, 9:17 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
15/1/24, 9:19 AM - +263 71 226 7257: Yes it does
15/1/24, 9:19 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
15/1/24, 9:19 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/1/24, 9:35 AM - +263 71 226 7257: Ok thats amazing
15/1/24, 10:25 AM - +263 71 226 7257: Thank you
16/1/24, 8:35 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Nicole

I hope you're all ready for a great session. Let's kick things off with a quick joke to lighten the mood:

Why did the math book look sad? Well, because it had too many problems! 😄
16/1/24, 8:38 AM - +263 71 226 7257: Good morning to you too
16/1/24, 8:38 AM - +263 71 226 7257: 😅😅
16/1/24, 8:42 AM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
16/1/24, 8:48 AM - +263 71 226 7257: I just really liked the story of Grace Manzou it really motivated me alot
16/1/24, 8:48 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
16/1/24, 8:49 AM - +263 71 226 7257: Yes it is
16/1/24, 8:49 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great!  At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
16/1/24, 8:50 AM - +263 71 226 7257: It sounds amazing
16/1/24, 8:55 AM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
16/1/24, 8:55 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 8:55 AM - +263 71 226 7257: Yes it is thank you
16/1/24, 9:00 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
16/1/24, 9:01 AM - +263 71 226 7257: Ok lam still going through it
16/1/24, 9:31 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let us connect tomorrow at the same time! See you!🚀
