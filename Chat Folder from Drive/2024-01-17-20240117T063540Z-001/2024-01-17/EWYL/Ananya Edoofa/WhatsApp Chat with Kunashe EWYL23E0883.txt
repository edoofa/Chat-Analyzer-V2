2/1/24, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Kunashe!

Before we dive into today's session, I'm curious – how was your New Year? Did you have a chance to celebrate and welcome the new chapter?
2/1/24, 2:09 PM - +263 77 502 2532: Good afternoon Ananya.
Yes indeed we had nice time welcoming the new chapter. I hope you are fine
2/1/24, 2:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Kunashe, why are you late?
2/1/24, 2:47 PM - +263 77 502 2532: Our internet is very poor
2/1/24, 2:47 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I understand however since our session time is over, let's wrap it up and look forward to continuing our discussion tomorrow at the same time. I'm excited to delve into more interesting topics and explore new ideas.

And now, here's a little humor to brighten your day: Why did the computer go to therapy? Because it had too many bytes of emotional baggage! 😄
2/1/24, 2:50 PM - +263 77 502 2532: 😁😁😁
3/1/24, 1:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Kunashe! 🌞

Let's start the day with a bit of fun and mystery. Here's a riddle for you: 

'I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have nobody, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?'
3/1/24, 1:48 PM - +263 71 618 4916: Good afternoon
3/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 77 502 2532: The answer is an 'Echo'
3/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great, Kunashe!🚀'
3/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
3/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 71 814 6495: No l do not understand can you explain
3/1/24, 1:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
3/1/24, 1:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
3/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 71 814 6495: Yes I understand thank you
3/1/24, 2:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
3/1/24, 2:03 PM - +263 71 814 6495: Well noted
3/1/24, 2:04 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
3/1/24, 2:06 PM - +263 71 814 6495: Yeah its super interesting
3/1/24, 2:08 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
3/1/24, 2:08 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
3/1/24, 2:24 PM - +263 71 814 6495: I have finished reading
3/1/24, 2:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I know we couldn't have a fruitful session today as I was preparing for something big coming up! I'll share it with you super soon. Meanwhile, let's conclude our session here and connect tomorrow at the same time!🤝🏽
3/1/24, 2:31 PM - +263 71 814 6495: Thank you the session was great
4/1/24, 1:39 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Kunashe!

How are you doing today? Shall we begin our session?
4/1/24, 1:43 PM - +263 71 618 4916: Good afternoon. Yes am available
4/1/24, 1:56 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Today, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
4/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 77 502 2532: This sounds great
4/1/24, 2:04 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
4/1/24, 2:05 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
4/1/24, 2:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, since our session time is over, let us connect tomorrow at the same time. I am so happy about your consistency. Maintain this, and I promise that we will excel in this program!
4/1/24, 2:31 PM - +263 77 502 2532: Okay thank you for today.
5/1/24, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Kunashe!

Every day is a new beginning, take a deep breath and start afresh. On this note, let us begin our session and make a change together! ☀️🌼
5/1/24, 2:56 PM - +263 77 502 2532: Good afternoon. Sorry about today. I got tide up with family issues.
5/1/24, 4:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Is everything alright, Kunashe?
5/1/24, 4:02 PM - +263 77 502 2532: Yes. We are now okay. Everything is fine now
5/1/24, 4:04 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright! We will reconnect in our next session, which is on Monday, as we do not hold sessions over the weekend. Wishing you a happy weekend!
5/1/24, 4:07 PM - +263 77 502 2532: Thank you. Have a nice weekend.
6/1/24, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Kunashe!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
6/1/24, 1:48 PM - +263 77 502 2532: Good afternoon.
6/1/24, 1:49 PM - +263 77 502 2532: Noted
11/1/24, 1:39 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Kunashe!

Before beginning our session, I want to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that took place over the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! It was so happening, and I am delighted to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only that, but we also hosted various industrial leaders, and it went exceptionally well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech Made Easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.

11/1/24, 2:42 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, I want you to read the document now and share your understanding with me.
11/1/24, 3:08 PM - +263 71 814 6495: I have read the document. I understood that this world has changed since covid 19 striked so there are a lot of new skills and jobs that can be created. There are also projects are offered by Edoofa. I understood about helping schools  to tie up with Edoofa and sharing innovations and class technology to imlroe their Educationa delivery and also carrier counseling
11/1/24, 3:18 PM - +263 71 814 6495: Some of these are :

12/1/24, 1:30 PM - +263 71 814 6495: Good afternoon
12/1/24, 1:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Kunashe!

Let us begin our session with a fact! Did you know that the total weight of ants on Earth is comparable to the total weight of all the humans on this planet? It's a staggering reminder of the incredible diversity and abundance of life around us.🤯🐜
12/1/24, 1:36 PM - +263 71 814 6495: Wow it's a pleasure to know this that is amazing
12/1/24, 1:58 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
12/1/24, 1:58 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/1/24, 1:58 PM - +263 71 814 6495: Okay
12/1/24, 2:04 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
12/1/24, 2:13 PM - +263 71 814 6495: I have learned cooperate alliance when l will have to identify companies
 in our  region. And also telling my family members about how Edoofa is helping me. Downloading a linktern account to talk Managers  and take their numbers and share meeting time with you. Connecting with the companies will create good leverage and even get a job
12/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing, thanks Kunashe. I’m happy with your understanding. 

So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
12/1/24, 2:17 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/1/24, 2:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, we shall connect in our next session. Since we don't have sessions over the weekend, let's reconnect on Monday. See you then!🚀
12/1/24, 2:49 PM - +263 71 814 6495: The  company must be student centric for example career development or a
social interaction platform. The company should not be too big or too small. Companies must not be financially sound. Firstly l must check current activities, and this gives me a brief explanation about the company, this gives me profile links to the employees
12/1/24, 2:49 PM - +263 71 814 6495: Thanks for the session

16/1/24, 1:45 PM - +263 71 814 6495: 😂😂😂
16/1/24, 1:45 PM - +263 71 814 6495: So true
16/1/24, 1:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, did you get a chance to listen to the audio that was shared with you?

16/1/24, 2:19 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *Using WhatsApp Community Groups for Outreach:*
*Step 1*: Create a WhatsApp group and name it using the format STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY. 

*Step 2*: Find the right students for your group to ensure effective communication about Edoofa.

*Purpose*: The goal is to reach a broad audience, providing accurate information about Edoofa to prepare them for a smooth counseling session.
16/1/24, 2:19 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Execution:
*Identify Potential Candidates:* - Reach out to students in Form 6 or those who have recently passed Form 6 (A-Level Examination).

*Connect with Form 6 Divisions*: - Assume there are 3 divisions in Form 6, each with around 20 students. Begin with one division. Connect with these students and request to be added to their official or unofficial WhatsApp group.

*Share Your Group Link*: - Once added, share the link to your created WhatsApp group, explaining that it's an opportunity to pursue education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on tuition fees. Encourage them to join for more details.

*Repeat the Process*: - Move on to the next divisions of Form 6, applying the same approach. In this way, you'll reach at least 60 students (3 divisions of Form 6).

*Extend to Form 5*: - Repeat the process in Form 5, targeting another 60 students.
16/1/24, 2:19 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *Result*:

You would have effectively shared information about Edoofa with a minimum of 120 students, creating awareness and interest among potential applicants. This method ensures a wide reach and prepares students for the upcoming counseling sessions.
16/1/24, 2:19 PM - Ananya Edoofa: INFORMATION TO BE PROVIDED TO THE STUDENTS

 I'm [Your Name], grateful for the Edoofa Scholarship taking me to study in India. With high tuition fees in Zimbabwe, this opportunity is a dream come true.
Back in Zimbabwe, internet costs were steep—around $500 annually. In India, it's just $40 a year, showing how much they value education.
In Zimbabwe, limited seats and job struggles after graduation were concerns. Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program eased these worries, offering $50 to $100 monthly.
Following the 5S principles helped me secure this scholarship. I encourage you to do the same. Counselors will ask questions based on the flyer attached.
Best of luck! Your dreams are closer than you think
