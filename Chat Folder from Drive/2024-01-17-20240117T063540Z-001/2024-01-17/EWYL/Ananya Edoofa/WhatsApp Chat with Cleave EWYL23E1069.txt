2/1/24, 9:04 AM - +263 78 602 7126: My parents are in  the group but currently father is not online.
2/1/24, 9:06 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright! Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
2/1/24, 9:07 AM - +263 78 602 7126: No ma'am l don't
2/1/24, 9:08 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
2/1/24, 9:08 AM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
2/1/24, 9:11 AM - +263 78 602 7126: Noted ma'am , am following
2/1/24, 9:12 AM - +263 78 602 7126: Wow this is a good opportunity for us as students
2/1/24, 9:12 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
2/1/24, 9:14 AM - +263 78 602 7126: Thank you ma'am am looking forward to this indeed..
2/1/24, 9:18 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
2/1/24, 9:22 AM - +263 78 602 7126: 🤌🤌indeed
2/1/24, 9:22 AM - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
2/1/24, 9:27 AM - +263 78 602 7126: Thank you l connect ma'am  l will give it all l have and also work towards attaining the objective.
2/1/24, 9:28 AM - Ananya Edoofa: As our session comes to a close, I appreciate our time together today. Let's wrap it up and look forward to continuing our discussion tomorrow at the same time. I'm excited to delve into more interesting topics and explore new ideas.

And now, here's a little humor to brighten your day: Why did the computer go to therapy? Because it had too many bytes of emotional baggage! 😄
2/1/24, 9:29 AM - +263 78 602 7126: 😂😂 thank you ma'am have a blessed day ..

6/1/24, 1:27 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Cleave!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:27 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
6/1/24, 3:07 PM - +263 78 602 7126: Ooh that is exciting news ma'am
6/1/24, 3:26 PM - +263 78 602 7126: Wish l could join you ma'am

11/1/24, 11:24 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Cleave!

I hope you are doing well. Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you this morning. Actually, I was sorting out some pictures and videos for you. Let us do one thing, for today let us connect today at 1:30 pm and I will share a lot about our three-day event!

Is that alright?
11/1/24, 11:50 AM - +263 78 602 7126: Yes indeed ma'am
11/1/24, 1:35 PM - +263 78 602 7126: Hello
11/1/24, 1:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Before beginning our session, I want to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that took place over the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! It was so happening, and I am delighted to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only that, but we also hosted various industrial leaders, and it went exceptionally well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech Made Easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.
11/1/24, 1:51 PM - +263 78 602 7126: 🥳🥳wow thus excellent can't wait to experience such events

I hope you are doing well. While I understand and appreciate that you are working to finance your education, it is crucial for you to finish your EWYL orientation with me, as mentioned earlier. If you are not able to do that, you can ask your parents to attend the session with me and understand the basics of the program.

This will ensure a smooth process, and we can later connect on the projects only. Please let me know if you proceed in this manner.
