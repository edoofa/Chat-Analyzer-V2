2/1/24, 8:42 AM - +263 71 364 4123: I'm good and you?

My new year was very much okay how about yours?

2/1/24, 9:05 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, Now that you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
2/1/24, 9:05 AM - Ananya Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_

Greetings Mr./Mrs *School Head Name*!
Hope you are doing well.

I am *Your Name* and I am a beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
I stand obliged to get an opportunity to connect with you, I hope to have a result/conclusion-driven conversation with you today.

May I know at what time you will be available to connect via Whatsapp?
2/1/24, 9:13 AM - +263 71 364 4123: Thank you will surely do that
2/1/24, 9:14 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now,  we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
2/1/24, 9:20 AM - +263 71 364 4123: Okay I'll send them
2/1/24, 9:22 AM - Ananya Edoofa: So, since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
2/1/24, 9:27 AM - +263 71 364 4123: Noted with thanks
2/1/24, 9:29 AM - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Monday and Thursday : 9:30 a.m to 11:00 a.m
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
2/1/24, 9:29 AM - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
2/1/24, 9:29 AM - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
2/1/24, 9:35 AM - +263 71 364 4123: Well noted I'll surely do that
4/1/24, 9:17 AM - +263 71 364 4123: Goodmorning Ms Ananya
4/1/24, 9:22 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Takundanashe!

I hope you are doing great! Have you dropped the message on the EWYL line?
4/1/24, 9:23 AM - +263 71 364 4123: Yes I did
4/1/24, 9:24 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Let us connect on the EWYL line then!
4/1/24, 9:25 AM - +263 71 364 4123: Okay so we won't be using this group?
4/1/24, 9:25 AM - Ananya Edoofa: We will, however for the sessions, we will connect on a specialized line!
4/1/24, 9:27 AM - +263 71 364 4123: Okay well understood
4/1/24, 9:27 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly join the line!

6/1/24, 1:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Takundanashe!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
6/1/24, 2:41 PM - +263 71 364 4123: Well noted

11/1/24, 9:58 AM - +263 71 364 4123: Good morning Ms Ananya
11/1/24, 11:09 AM - Ananya Edoofa: A lovely morning to you, Takundanashe!

Kindly excuse me for the short delay. I wanted to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that was going on for the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! You know, it was so happening, and I am happy to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only this, but we also welcomed various industrial leaders, and it went super well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech made easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us as well. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.

On the previous session before that we talked about reaching out to students from my school through contacting our headmistress. Inorder to facilitate the project I chose inorder to build a community in my home country
16/1/24, 9:19 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright! Now, Let me help you with the kind of communication that you should do with the school heads, okay?



Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:
Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
16/1/24, 9:22 AM - +263 71 364 4123: 1. Mabelreign Girls High and Yes it's connected to Edoofa
3. Harare
2.I am immensely grateful for the invaluable guidance provided by my counselor, Sir Sahil, throughout the enrollment process at Edoofa. His expertise illuminated crucial aspects, such as understanding the percentage of scholarship available, the mechanics of scholarship credits, and insightful advice on choosing from the diverse range of programs. Sir Sahil not only facilitated the enrollment procedure but also served as a knowledgeable guide, ensuring that I made informed decisions about the programs aligning with my goals. Thanks to his support, my journey with Edoofa has been not only smooth but also enriched with a deeper understanding of the opportunities available.
16/1/24, 9:24 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, now that your school is already connected with us,  I would like you to connect with other School Heads. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all other fellow school students as well.
16/1/24, 9:24 AM - +263 71 364 4123: Well noted ma'am
16/1/24, 9:25 AM - +263 71 364 4123: Let's proceed
16/1/24, 9:27 AM - Ananya Edoofa: May I know if you have the other School Head’s Whatsapp Contact? And if not I suggest you find it Today so we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for other School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
16/1/24, 9:29 AM - +263 71 364 4123: I don't have them now but I'll definitely look for them today
16/1/24, 9:31 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright! Now that our session time is over, let us connect tomorrow at the same time! See you!🚀
16/1/24, 9:33 AM - +263 71 364 4123: Have a good day 😊
