7/1/24, 9:58 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Dalitso!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called SLICE CON' 24 for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
7/1/24, 9:58 AM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the 8th, 9th, and 10th of January, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
12/1/24, 12:17 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Dalitso!

I know we missed our session on Tuesday, but I'm back from the event and I'm really excited to catch up with you! Let's connect on our EWYL line to discuss everything!
12/1/24, 1:52 PM - +265 992 60 60 54: Sorry I was occupied I thought we would continue next Tuesday.

It has been observed that you have not been attending your sessions lately, nor following your EWYL ritual.

You know, we specifically allocate slots and time for you, and your non-attendance is truly disappointing and demotivating.

If you are facing any challenges, please let me know so that I can assist you. If you do not share it with me, how would I be able to help you?
16/1/24, 12:38 PM - +265 888 35 24 25: Halo!! I am really sorry for not coming to you earlier enough. Dalitso is not feeling well hence his silence. I am sure he will fully dedicate his time to these important sessions going forward. Once again sorry that as parents we did come to u on time. Thanks
