5/1/24, 5:46 PM - +263 77 388 8622: Hello Ms Ananya, how are you and work. Here we are fine. I am happy to interact with you on this platform. My name is Walter Mushambi and l am Wynne's parent/father. Thank you for the scheduled times for the sessions with Wynne. However during these times or hours he will be at school and the school does not allow him to have a phone at school. May you kindly help by having the sessions with him from 3:30 pm to 4:30 pm. By this time he will be now at home where he will be now free to use the phone. May you kindly help on this one  so that Wynne will not lose any of your sessions and also so that the school not treat him as someone who is mischievous.
11/1/24, 11:36 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, @263773888622 

Kindly excuse me for the short delay. I wanted to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that was going on for the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! You know, it was so happening, and I am happy to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only this, but we also welcomed various industrial leaders, and it went super well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech made easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us as well. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.

12/1/24, 2:42 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, @263773888622 

I understand and I am quite happy to see your dedication to Wynne's future education. 

To continue our journey, I'd like to offer you a choice between two-time slots. Please select one that works for you:

Monday to Friday, 8:30 AM to 9:30 AM
Monday to Friday, 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM
Let me know which one suits your schedule best.
12/1/24, 2:44 PM - +263 77 388 8622: Thank you for the time schedules. I am comfortable with the 1:30 to 2:30 time.
Thank you for this arrangement.
15/1/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
15/1/24, 1:56 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
15/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 77 388 8622: Thank you thank you for the clarification on the first objective. The objectives are very powerful.
15/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 77 388 8622: As parents we highly appreciate the goals.
15/1/24, 2:04 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
15/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 77 388 8622: Thank you very much for the rich introductions. I will be happy and ready to receive the lectures and knowledge from them. Thank you
15/1/24, 2:07 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
15/1/24, 2:12 PM - +263 77 388 8622: Very interesting. 
I go for Monday /Thursday.
15/1/24, 2:14 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, for now, you have to attend the sessions daily. Once you are done with your orientation sessions, you can choose the days!
15/1/24, 2:15 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
15/1/24, 2:15 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/1/24, 2:17 PM - +263 77 388 8622: Ok ok , thank you l understand.
15/1/24, 2:19 PM - +263 77 388 8622: Ok ok let me go over the newsletters.
15/1/24, 2:22 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
15/1/24, 2:26 PM - +263 77 388 8622: The 3 quotes, l like them most.
15/1/24, 2:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright! Now let us conclude our session with a motivating quote : 

_Remember, every step forward counts, no matter how small. Embrace the challenges, for they are the stepping stones to success. Keep pushing, stay positive, and watch your journey unfold. You've got this!_🚀
15/1/24, 2:31 PM - +263 77 388 8622: What a motivational quote, l really like it.

I hope you're all ready for a great session. Let's kick things off with a quick joke to lighten the mood:

Why did the math book look sad? Well, because it had too many problems! 😄
16/1/24, 1:42 PM - +263 77 388 8622: Kkkk what a nice joke. It has a lot of problems for sure but the problems can be solved
16/1/24, 1:46 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Indeed, At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
