15/1/24, 1:51 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
15/1/24, 1:51 PM - +27 73 074 2703: Thank you
15/1/24, 2:03 PM - Saloni Edoofa: So Melchizedek, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
15/1/24, 2:08 PM - +27 73 074 2703: My long term goal is to hopefully be one of the main pioneers in the advancement of AI and how it will aid us as humans in making our lives simpler and the EWYL program will help me in the sense that I will be able to get the knowledge and skills I need with a lesser burden financially which will bring out the best as I will not be stressed therefore I can fully focus on my education
15/1/24, 3:36 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
15/1/24, 3:40 PM - +27 73 074 2703: see you tomorrow
16/1/24, 1:34 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Tuesday everyone, 
How are you doing?

May we begin with our session?
16/1/24, 1:37 PM - +27 73 074 2703: Hey ms Saloni I am great how are you and yes we may begin today’s session
16/1/24, 1:44 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you!
16/1/24, 1:45 PM - Saloni Edoofa: This is amazing Melchizedek, this is so good!

I am happy to know you this closer, there is more to dwell on from this partnership that we are going to have.
16/1/24, 1:45 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
16/1/24, 1:46 PM - +27 73 074 2703: Please explain the objectives
16/1/24, 1:52 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
16/1/24, 1:52 PM - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
16/1/24, 1:56 PM - +27 73 074 2703: I understand
16/1/24, 2:10 PM - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 2:12 PM - +27 73 074 2703: I have read
16/1/24, 2:19 PM - Saloni Edoofa: So, what did you grasp from it?
16/1/24, 2:20 PM - +27 73 074 2703: That I am able to cover most if not all of my tuition fees if I work hard and in tandem with the EWYL program
16/1/24, 4:06 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
