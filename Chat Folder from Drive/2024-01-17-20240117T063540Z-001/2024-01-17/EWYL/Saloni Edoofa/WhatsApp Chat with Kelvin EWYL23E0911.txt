2/1/24, 2:03 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
2/1/24, 2:04 PM - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
2/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 77 707 4506: OK now I understand

16/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 77 707 4506: I understand
16/1/24, 1:46 PM - +263 77 707 4506: So mom do I have to start working on this project now
16/1/24, 1:53 PM - Saloni Edoofa: There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
16/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 77 707 4506: OK
16/1/24, 1:55 PM - +263 77 707 4506: So does that mean I can start by doing project # 2 or
16/1/24, 2:07 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, but after you have understood the second and third project well.
16/1/24, 2:08 PM - Saloni Edoofa: *Kelvin, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Kelvin!
16/1/24, 2:08 PM - +263 77 707 4506: OK so can we move on and discuss about the second and the third project
16/1/24, 2:08 PM - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 2:22 PM - +263 77 707 4506: I have finished listing to the audio
16/1/24, 4:06 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
