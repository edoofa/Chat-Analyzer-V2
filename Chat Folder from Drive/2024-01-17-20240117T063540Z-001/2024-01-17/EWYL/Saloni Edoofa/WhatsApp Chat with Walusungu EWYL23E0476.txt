28/12/23, 8:13 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Walusungu,
I hope this message finds you well.

As we approach the end of the year, I am filled with excitement about the upcoming new year. It's a time for optimism, hope, and the opportunity to nurture beautifully curated relationships. However, upon reflection on our journey so far, I recognize a bit of inconsistency and irregularity.

I understand that the holiday season, including Christmas celebrations and New Year enjoyment, may be keeping you occupied. Despite this, I believe it's important for us to consider how we can strengthen our relationship in the EWYL Program. I am eager to hear your thoughts on how we can restart and enhance our collaboration.
28/12/23, 10:43 AM - +260 96 2476932: Yes yes I apologize for the inconsistency and irregularity.
On how we can strengthen this relationship, I believe I have to work on being consistent and I need to ask more questions
28/12/23, 10:43 AM - +260 96 2476932: Concerning the EWYL program.
29/12/23, 8:26 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Walusungu,
How are you? <This message was edited>
29/12/23, 8:27 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Well that is absolutely alright that you are concerned, may I know if you are willing to continue the sessions from today onwards or after new year?
29/12/23, 3:22 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day,

You know when I was a student and till now, I make agendas on what I wish to achieve in life this year, and how I can transform it for the betterment of not just myself, but my family and the people around me. Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.
I, as your wellwisher and companion, wish you that you also push yourself and make the most of the opportunities that are coming your way starting from the EWYL Program that offers you a chance to *stand on your own feet*. Next year, _we will be a few months away from our flight to India_✈️, and I want to see you living a journey till that time that is filled with *hard work and dedication*. I have personally curated this message from the bottom of my heart to wish you a very *Happy New Year, 2024* 🫶🏻

5/1/24, 10:08 AM - Saloni Edoofa: First, we will start with the community building project.
5/1/24, 10:09 AM - Saloni Edoofa: This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Walusungu!
5/1/24, 10:09 AM - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/1/24, 10:27 AM - +260 96 2476932: For each student I manage to convince to enrol and pay earns me $20. Right?

 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
5/1/24, 10:43 AM - +260 96 2476932: Okay so I can reach out to any student as long as they are able to pay?
5/1/24, 10:44 AM - +260 96 2476932: Am I supposed to send this to you after it is filled in by the student?
5/1/24, 10:58 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, that is true
5/1/24, 10:58 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, that is true also
5/1/24, 10:58 AM - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
5/1/24, 10:59 AM - Saloni Edoofa: *Using WhatsApp Community Groups for Outreach:*
*Step 1*: Create a WhatsApp group and name it using the format STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY. For example, if you're the mentor, it would be *Walusungu/Saloni/5JAN2023*.

*Step 2*: Find the right students for your group to ensure effective communication about Edoofa.

*Purpose*: The goal is to reach a broad audience, providing accurate information about Edoofa to prepare them for a smooth counseling session.
5/1/24, 11:01 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Execution:
*Identify Potential Candidates:* - Reach out to students in Form 6 or those who have recently passed Form 6 (A-Level Examination).

*Connect with Form 6 Divisions*: - Assume there are 3 divisions in Form 6, each with around 20 students. Begin with one division. Connect with these students and request to be added to their official or unofficial WhatsApp group.
5/1/24, 11:01 AM - Saloni Edoofa: *Share Your Group Link*: - Once added, share the link to your created WhatsApp group, explaining that it's an opportunity to pursue education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on tuition fees. Encourage them to join for more details.

*Repeat the Process*: - Move on to the next divisions of Form 6, applying the same approach. In this way, you'll reach at least 60 students (3 divisions of Form 6).

*Extend to Form 5*: - Repeat the process in Form 5, targeting another 60 students.
5/1/24, 11:02 AM - +260 96 2476932: Okay thank you and I'll do my best.
I do have a question though it concerns me. Has a university been found yet?

16/1/24, 10:15 AM - +260 96 2476932: I do not want to manipulate people into joining the program because it might not work for them and there is no money in the country or rather money is lacking. Personally I'm still learning to trust this program hence I'd feel guilty if it does not work out for them.
16/1/24, 10:29 AM - Saloni Edoofa: I appreciate your initial hesitations, and I completely understand. Allow me to share some exciting news about our expanding Zambian community for this academic year.

16/1/24, 10:29 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Walusungu, through our conversation, I don't aim to coerce any student into joining our growing community. Rather, we seek to instill trust in the idea. Each individual's experience may vary, but I assure you, the Edoofa family is committed to continuous improvement. Initial uncertainties are bound to dissipate once students become a part of this thriving community.
16/1/24, 10:32 AM - +260 96 2476932: Thank you for sharing this with me. It has given me food for thought
16/1/24, 10:44 AM - Saloni Edoofa: I am happy to hear that and Walusungu, we are not forcing anyone. If anyone wishes to join this wave of accessing their higher education dream in India, they can of course join in.
