Next year, _we will be a few months away from our flight to India_✈️, and I want to see you living a journey till that time that is filled with *hard work and dedication*.

15/1/24, 1:02 PM - +263 78 972 4211: There is a person who once applied for the EDOOFA scholarship program through me and l sent his Application Form to you. He communicated with the EDOOFA team with Mr. Piyush as his counselor/ mentor but stopped communicating because he had no financial capability at the time to support his dream of studying in India. His name is Tinotenda Chemhuru. He reached out to me saying that he is now ready financially to continue with the EDOOFA scholarship program. 
I am kindly asking for your help to assist him in the resumption of his journey with EDOOFA.
