Edoofa organized a grand flagship event from Monday to Wednesday named SLICE Con'24 (Symposium of Leaders, Inventors, and Creators with Edoofa)🫱🏻‍🫲🏼 where our Indian Edoofians, representing partner universities,  immersed in a grand event featuring CEOs and Marketing heads of multi-millionaire brands📈, braced themselves for networking opportunities, internships, and more. The event was really grand, let me show you a short glimpse of one of the days.
