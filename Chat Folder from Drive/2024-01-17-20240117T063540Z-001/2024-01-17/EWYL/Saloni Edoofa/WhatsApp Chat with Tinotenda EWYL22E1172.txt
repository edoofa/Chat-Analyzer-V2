29/12/23, 4:02 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day,

You know when I was a student and till now, I make agendas on what I wish to achieve in life this year, and how I can transform it for the betterment of not just myself, but my family and the people around me. Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.
I, as your wellwisher and companion, wish you that you also push yourself and make the most of the opportunities that are coming your way starting from the EWYL Program that offers you a chance to *stand on your own feet*. Next year, _we will be a few months away from our flight to India_✈️, and I want to see you living a journey till that time that is filled with *hard work and dedication*. I have personally curated this message from the bottom of my heart to wish you a very *Happy New Year, 2024* 🫶🏻

12/1/24, 4:08 PM - +91 76268 84388: The problem is I got a cold
12/1/24, 4:08 PM - +91 76268 84388: But am sure I will be okay
12/1/24, 4:11 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, I know you will be okay, how is your health now?
15/1/24, 5:33 AM - +91 76268 84388: I am better now
15/1/24, 5:33 AM - +91 76268 84388: Good morning ma’am
15/1/24, 5:34 AM - +91 76268 84388: I wanted to know if the students who came to the trip on 10 January are getting duty leave
15/1/24, 5:34 AM - +91 76268 84388: Since some of us our classes had started
15/1/24, 5:34 AM - +91 76268 84388: So we were absent in class
16/1/24, 9:34 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day, Tinotenda!
How are you?
16/1/24, 9:39 AM - Saloni Edoofa: I am aware that your second semester at LPU was commencing on January 10th, coinciding with the SLICE Con'2024.

While I understand the importance of attendance at LPU, I  would like to emphasize that this event was a unique opportunity, occurring only once a year. Edoofa has invested significantly in making this event possible, and I believe the benefits you'll gain from attending are invaluable.

Considering the one-time nature of this event and the added advantages it brings, we thought that all the students would be coming with that approach. Yes, the duty leave won't be provided but I am sure you get the background of the same.
16/1/24, 9:33 PM - +91 76268 84388: I just hope it doesn’t decrease my attendance
16/1/24, 9:33 PM - +91 76268 84388: Thank you
