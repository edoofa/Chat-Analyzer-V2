I hope I find you well. 
I am Tafadzwa Bethel Matsiya and l am a proud Edoofian. I was very fortunate to be part of the Edoofa family which is a scholarship program that was founded by Mr Angaad sing. It provides for an opportunity for African students to study in India on half scholarship cover.  It also has got an added advantage for the students through it's Earn While You Learn program. This program allows for students to earn some scholarship credits that can be used to offset the fees balance that remain after the scholarship cover. 
 I thought I should share this important information with you so that you can help me share this good news with students in your school. I am also going to share with you some other information with you that proves Edoofa is a genuine program that will not harm your students but only benefit them
5/1/24, 10:43 AM - Saloni Edoofa: That is great, I have noted!
5/1/24, 10:43 AM - Saloni Edoofa: TODAY, I would like you to connect with other School Heads. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all other fellow school students as well.
5/1/24, 10:43 AM - Saloni Edoofa: May I know if you have the other School Head’s Whatsapp Contact? And if not I suggest you find it Today so we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for other School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
5/1/24, 10:46 AM - +263 77 289 4595: I have Mr Unzemoyos' contact.He is the deputy head of Gaza High School
