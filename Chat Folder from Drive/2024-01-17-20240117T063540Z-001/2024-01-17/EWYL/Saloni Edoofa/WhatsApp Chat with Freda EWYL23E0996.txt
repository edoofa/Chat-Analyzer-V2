26/12/23, 1:56 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Well, you have hit the right chord👏🏼
26/12/23, 1:57 PM - Saloni Edoofa: *Freda, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Freda!

26/12/23, 2:10 PM - Saloni Edoofa: So can you share what have you learned from it?
26/12/23, 2:17 PM - +265 996 40 67 62: It is talking about establishing or building, strong relationships and identities within a particular group or community. The goal of all this is to improve interaction in the community. And the project is community building, which looks at networking and help African students to be assisted with Edoofa on social media which helps students to acquire international education and to direct them towards the rights and proper education through the counseling of Edoofa‘s counselors
26/12/23, 2:19 PM - Saloni Edoofa: That’s awesome- Freda, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.
26/12/23, 2:19 PM - Saloni Edoofa: 1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

Or those that would also like to pursue their masters as well? <This message was edited>
26/12/23, 2:25 PM - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 2:26 PM - +265 996 40 67 62: Ok great
26/12/23, 2:26 PM - +265 996 40 67 62: Thank you
26/12/23, 2:30 PM - Saloni Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
26/12/23, 2:31 PM - +265 996 40 67 62: Wow great
26/12/23, 2:32 PM - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
26/12/23, 2:33 PM - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Freda/Saloni/26DEC2023*
26/12/23, 2:33 PM - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
26/12/23, 2:33 PM - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
26/12/23, 2:33 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
26/12/23, 2:33 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
26/12/23, 2:35 PM - +265 996 40 67 62: Well noted
26/12/23, 3:57 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
26/12/23, 4:00 PM - +265 996 40 67 62: Alright have a splendid day
27/12/23, 1:37 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon Freda,
How are you?

I hope you are excited about our session today🫶🏻
27/12/23, 1:40 PM - +265 996 40 67 62: I’m fine thank you
27/12/23, 1:40 PM - +265 996 40 67 62: How are you
27/12/23, 1:40 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you!
27/12/23, 1:41 PM - Saloni Edoofa: May I know if you formed a group or maybe were able to add someone?
27/12/23, 1:41 PM - +265 996 40 67 62: All set for today’s session
27/12/23, 1:42 PM - +265 996 40 67 62: No not yet I plan on contacting them today
27/12/23, 1:43 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Since you are currently going on the phase of pursuing Masters, may I know if you are in touch with your school friends?
27/12/23, 2:49 PM - +265 996 40 67 62: Sorry network was down
27/12/23, 2:50 PM - +265 996 40 67 62: Yes I am still in contact with them
28/12/23, 8:50 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Freda,
How are you?
28/12/23, 8:50 AM - Saloni Edoofa: We will surely discuss the same in our session today.
28/12/23, 8:50 AM - +265 996 40 67 62: Good morning 
I’m fine thank you 
How are you?
28/12/23, 8:50 AM - +265 996 40 67 62: Sure
28/12/23, 12:24 PM - +265 999 95 13 05: Good morning. I was trying to pay for the registration fee to the university unfortunately the bank says they do not know when they could remit the funds to your account due to forex issues. This being the deadline for registration what would be your advice
28/12/23, 12:24 PM - +265 999 95 13 05: They've only said they prioritise medical treatment and next is education. Unless you give a longer extension considering also that School will open in September 24, it will be difficult this end
28/12/23, 1:38 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I hope you are excited about our session today🫶🏻
28/12/23, 1:38 PM - +265 996 40 67 62: Yes I am
28/12/23, 1:39 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I would really appreciate that you connect with the Admission Team for the same, they will quide you in the right direction.
28/12/23, 1:49 PM - Saloni Edoofa: May I know if you were able to form the group?
28/12/23, 1:49 PM - +265 996 40 67 62: No not yet but I have reached out to a few people
28/12/23, 1:50 PM - +265 996 40 67 62: They said they should consult their parents first
28/12/23, 1:54 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, let me share with you the information that you can share with them.
28/12/23, 1:55 PM - +265 996 40 67 62: Ok
28/12/23, 1:56 PM - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
28/12/23, 1:56 PM - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 1:56 PM - +265 996 40 67 62: Great ok thank you
28/12/23, 1:58 PM - +265 996 40 67 62: It’s Malawi and not Zimbabwe but thank you
28/12/23, 2:07 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Oh, I am sorry, let me share a revised version of it.
28/12/23, 2:08 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am honored to be a selected student for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program, enabling me to pursue tertiary education in India. Dreaming of studying abroad intensified after witnessing rising tuition fees in Malawian universities, reaching up to K1,000,000 annually, and additional charges escalating by K450,000. The cost of living further adds up to K800,000.
In Malawi, parents spend between K1,900,000 and K2,250,000 per year at public universities, with potential years of waiting for desired courses. Private universities, costing double, are financially unviable for my parents. Edoofa’s Earn While You Learn Program, offering $50-$100 per month, aligns perfectly with my goal to support my family while studying.
Pursuing education in India is more affordable, but not without challenges. The 5'S method guided my qualification for this scholarship. I encourage you to sincerely follow these five pointers, as counselors will base their questions on the attached flyer.
Complete the Offline Form of EDOOFA after mastering the 5s of Edoofa. Best of luck! 💥
28/12/23, 2:10 PM - +265 996 40 67 62: This is will very helpful thank you
28/12/23, 2:19 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Let me share more.

Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.
I, as your wellwisher and companion, wish you that you also push yourself and make the most of the opportunities that are coming your way starting from the EWYL Program that offers you a chance to *stand on your own feet*.

3/1/24, 1:43 PM - +265 996 40 67 62: I have found two people but they were skeptical because they did MSCE which ends with form 4 and not form 6. So they wanted me to verify for them before proceeding
3/1/24, 1:44 PM - +265 996 40 67 62: Due to this
3/1/24, 1:49 PM - Saloni Edoofa: No worries, were you able to clarify their doubts?
3/1/24, 1:50 PM - +265 996 40 67 62: I was waiting for your response so that I could but they are very much interested and willing
3/1/24, 1:50 PM - +265 996 40 67 62: That was the only hiccup
3/1/24, 1:55 PM - Saloni Edoofa: That sounds great, did they fill the form?
3/1/24, 1:56 PM - +265 996 40 67 62: No they were waiting for confirmation
3/1/24, 1:57 PM - +265 996 40 67 62: I hope it’s okay for them to apply ?
3/1/24, 1:57 PM - +265 996 40 67 62: MSCE ends with form 4 and not form 6
3/1/24, 2:05 PM - Saloni Edoofa: No, they can not apply
3/1/24, 2:06 PM - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>

I’m fine thank you 
How are you?
4/1/24, 1:42 PM - +265 996 40 67 62: Yes we can
4/1/24, 1:43 PM - +265 996 40 67 62: I have created a group with one student looking forward to pursuing their masters from my previous university
4/1/24, 1:52 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you!
4/1/24, 1:52 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, I saw that you added me and I felt over the cloud Freda, congratulations🫶🏻
4/1/24, 1:53 PM - +265 996 40 67 62: Thank you very much 🥳
4/1/24, 1:53 PM - Saloni Edoofa: You already have so much to share with them in terms of information, and content. Make sure to keep them engaged.
4/1/24, 1:53 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Now, it’s been an interesting conversation with you so far. However, I have some cool things left to share and thus, I think we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
4/1/24, 1:53 PM - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
4/1/24, 1:54 PM - +265 996 40 67 62: Alright
4/1/24, 1:54 PM - +265 996 40 67 62: Alright
4/1/24, 1:56 PM - +265 996 40 67 62: Alright
4/1/24, 1:56 PM - +265 996 40 67 62: Well explained and understood. I’ll be waiting for the reference letter
4/1/24, 2:03 PM - Saloni Edoofa: So, I am excited to hear what have you grasped from this audio. Tell me?
4/1/24, 2:08 PM - +265 996 40 67 62: The last project is the African schools reform project.
It involves contacting schools especially one’s previous school to inform them how lucky they are to part of the Edoofa program.

It will involve contacting local schools within my area and informing them why I joined Edoofa in the first place and the future plans I have as well as the program to be studied.

Loice performed searches like 'School nearby,' 'School in Harare,' and 'School in Manicaland,' generating valuable results. Remarkably, she achieved this without physically visiting the schools. Using Google, she gathered essential information, including contact details, and then initiated communication with them via WhatsApp.

16/1/24, 3:52 PM - +265 996 40 67 62: Yes i believe I did my part but for the other student he is still in the dark though I created a group. I hope you saw it?
16/1/24, 4:08 PM - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 4:23 PM - +265 996 40 67 62: I was waiting for your go ahead
