16/1/24, 1:49 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Makanaka, we were on the second project - COMMUNITY BUILDING.
16/1/24, 1:49 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Did you hear the audio that I shared twice?
16/1/24, 1:52 PM - +263 71 989 7144: Yes I did
16/1/24, 2:04 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share in-depth understanding of the same with me?
16/1/24, 2:29 PM - +263 71 989 7144: The audio is talking about Community Building whereby it is being referred to as being a process of establishing and strengthening connections, relationships and shared identities among individuals within a particular group or community. It involves creating a supportive and inclusive environment where people feel a sense of belonging and are able to collaborate and communicate. The goal is to foster a positive and cohesive community that promotes social interaction and participation as well as a sense of responsibility in order to be able to achieve our determined goals. 
One of the aims of this project for students to learn how to liberate social media in order to help African students to join Edoofa and have the same opportunity we had to acquire international education. 
The project also encourages students who have a mindset of identifying opportunities and sharing them openly to create something that will have an impact in the life of others. 
To complete this project we are encouraged to reach to African students who just finished their senior year or who are in their senior year in Secondary school and persuade and refer these students to the program and the head of the organization. 
Lastly the audio goes ahead to mention the scholarship credits that each student will earn for completing the project.
16/1/24, 3:49 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
16/1/24, 4:46 PM - +263 71 989 7144: Thank you Ms Saloni
