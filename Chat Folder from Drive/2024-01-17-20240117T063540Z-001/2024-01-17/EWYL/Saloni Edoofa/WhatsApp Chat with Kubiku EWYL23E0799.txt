27/12/23, 1:24 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Kubiku,
I hope this message finds you well.

As we approach the end of the year, I am filled with excitement about the upcoming new year. It's a time for optimism, hope, and the opportunity to nurture beautifully curated relationships. However, upon reflection on our journey so far, I recognize a bit of inconsistency and irregularity.

I understand that the holiday season, including Christmas celebrations and New Year enjoyment, may be keeping you occupied. Despite this, I believe it's important for us to consider how we can strengthen our relationship in the EWYL Program. I am eager to hear your thoughts on how we can restart and enhance our collaboration.

You know when I was a student and till now, I make agendas on what I wish to achieve in life this year, and how I can transform it for the betterment of not just myself, but my family and the people around me. Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.
I, as your wellwisher and companion, wish you that you also push yourself and make the most of the opportunities that are coming your way starting from the EWYL Program that offers you a chance to *stand on your own feet*. Next year, _we will be a few months away from our flight to India_✈️, and I want to see you living a journey till that time that is filled with *hard work and dedication*. I have personally curated this message from the bottom of my heart to wish you a very *Happy New Year, 2024* 🫶🏻

16/1/24, 1:02 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - *EDOOFA -Education For All.*

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *a lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as a mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
16/1/24, 1:02 PM - Saloni Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of* more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
 
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
16/1/24, 1:02 PM - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 1:02 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I'm [Your Name], grateful for the Edoofa Scholarship taking me to study in India. With high tuition fees in Zimbabwe, this opportunity is a dream come true.
Back in Zimbabwe, internet costs were steep—around $500 annually. In India, it's just $40 a year, showing how much they value education.
In Zimbabwe, limited seats and job struggles after graduation were concerns. Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program eased these worries, offering $50 to $100 monthly.
Following the 5S principles helped me secure this scholarship. I encourage you to do the same. Counselors will ask questions based on the flyer attached.
Best of luck! Your dreams are closer than you think
