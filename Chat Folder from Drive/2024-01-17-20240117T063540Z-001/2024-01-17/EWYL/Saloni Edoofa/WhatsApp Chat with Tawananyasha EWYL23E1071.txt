Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.

29/12/23, 2:31 PM - Saloni Edoofa: So Tawananyasha, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
29/12/23, 2:37 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Ok ma'am
29/12/23, 2:38 PM - Saloni Edoofa: You know when I was a student and till now, I make agendas on what I wish to achieve in life this year, and how I can transform it for the betterment of not just myself, but my family and the people around me. Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.
I, as your wellwisher and companion, wish you that you also push yourself and make the most of the opportunities that are coming your way starting from the EWYL Program that offers you a chance to *stand on your own feet*. Next year, _we will be a few months away from our flight to India_✈️, and I want to see you living a journey till that time that is filled with *hard work and dedication*. I have personally curated this message from the bottom of my heart to wish you a very *Happy New Year, 2024* 🫶🏻

I just don't want to be someone who is only successful at a family level but not yet giving back to the society not having any positive impact in the society. Im looking forward to being that one person on which, when my name is called upon people smile because i will be there to change the community in a very positive way hence i just want to be someone who gives a strong positive impact in the society and even a country at large.
As for this EWYL program im wishing to do it whole heartedly n most of all earn much money so as to help my mother financially through my higher education

2/1/24, 2:13 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Your dedication to becoming a successful lawyer known for truth and positive impact in society is admirable. Your commitment to the EWYL program and your goal to financially support your mother through higher education reflect your strong sense of responsibility. Keep pursuing your dreams; your aspirations for positive change are truly commendable!
2/1/24, 2:14 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Thank you
2/1/24, 2:23 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
2/1/24, 2:29 PM - +263 73 736 4250: No ma'am please enlighten me
2/1/24, 3:36 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.

How are you?

May we begin with our session?
3/1/24, 1:42 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Good afternoon Ms Saloni

Im okay and you?
Yes we may begin
3/1/24, 1:44 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you!
3/1/24, 1:45 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
3/1/24, 1:45 PM - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
3/1/24, 1:48 PM - +263 73 736 4250: That is good
3/1/24, 1:49 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Ok ma'am, im following
Its quite understandable

3/1/24, 2:47 PM - +263 73 736 4250: I figured that with hard work you can achieve anything

4/1/24, 1:41 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Thursday everyone,

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.

Let me share about myself…

4/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Ok ma'am

4/1/24, 2:17 PM - +263 73 736 4250: So I have heard and I'm delighted to finally know you and have you as my mentor, and thank you for congratulating me for this journey we are about to start together as my mentor and most of all a sister
As always u are acknowledging hard work and passion, and i trust that with your experience i will totally come out with something big
4/1/24, 2:20 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Thank you so much for these encouraging words, they have made my entire day and as I mentioned earlier, a teacher is nothing without a teacher, and I believe to go higher with you on this journey!
4/1/24, 2:21 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
4/1/24, 2:21 PM - Saloni Edoofa: *Sounds interesting, right?*
4/1/24, 2:21 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Same here ma'am ☺️
4/1/24, 2:26 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Great, Tawananyasha! Now here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
4/1/24, 2:26 PM - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
4/1/24, 2:26 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Yes ma'am

5/1/24, 2:11 PM - Saloni Edoofa: No worries, I can understand that.
5/1/24, 2:13 PM - +263 77 379 7485: Ok, thank you for understanding, 
I am at work right now, she could have used my phone
5/1/24, 2:24 PM - Saloni Edoofa: That is alright, I can understand that!
5/1/24, 3:14 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I apologize for the scheduling message earlier. As previously discussed, no sessions are scheduled for Saturday and Sunday.

3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Tawananyasha?
11/1/24, 2:12 PM - +263 73 736 4250: That sounds really grt
11/1/24, 2:20 PM - Saloni Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you.

Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?

Have a great evening
12/1/24, 1:36 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Friday everyone,
How are you?

May we begin with our session?
12/1/24, 1:41 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Good afternoon ma'am
Yes plizz
12/1/24, 1:50 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Did you go through the document?
12/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Yes ma'am
12/1/24, 2:01 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Ma'am im very sorry im having network problems today
12/1/24, 2:10 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, that’s wonderful. Tawananyasha- I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
12/1/24, 2:10 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Ok ma'am let me try but my network so far is too low, im so sorry
12/1/24, 2:25 PM - Saloni Edoofa: No worries at all, I can understand that.
12/1/24, 2:26 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Once the network allows, I surely want you to share everything once you have stable network
12/1/24, 2:36 PM - +263 73 736 4250: I have understood that the document answers people's questions like when one wants to get a fully funded scholarship, and most of all it clarifies more about Edoofa then going to the Earn while you learn program, it provides skills which helps in better communication, time management and negotiation skill. The projects are based on researches, content writing and many more. The money is nt earned in form of cash buh goes straight to the school fees and one can earn up to even 100 dollars a month. Mostly it helps one to be employable. Since we come there with student visas we aren't able to work therefore we do internships to help us
15/1/24, 9:32 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
