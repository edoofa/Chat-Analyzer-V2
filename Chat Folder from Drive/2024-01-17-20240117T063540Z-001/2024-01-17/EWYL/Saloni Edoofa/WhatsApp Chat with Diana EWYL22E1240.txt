27/12/23, 1:22 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Diana,
I hope this message finds you well.

As we approach the end of the year, I am filled with excitement about the upcoming new year. It's a time for optimism, hope, and the opportunity to nurture beautifully curated relationships. However, upon reflection on our journey so far, I recognize a bit of inconsistency and irregularity.

I understand that the holiday season, including Christmas celebrations and New Year enjoyment, may be keeping you occupied. Despite this, I believe it's important for us to consider how we can strengthen our relationship in the EWYL Program. I am eager to hear your thoughts on how we can restart and enhance our collaboration.

I hope I find you well..I come with a heavy heart to let you know that Diana could not make the grade you wanted for university intake..she failed all the subjects and in that regard I will need her to repeat..I will therefore ask for the refund of $350us that I had previously deposited for her enrollment... thanking you in advance and hoping to continue communicating should she make it next time..
Thanking you in advance and please let me know when I would expect the refund.
