I hope you all are doing well.

Edoofa has provided me with such an amazing opportunity to earn and learn. I feel honored to be a part of the EWYL Program and it has been a very learning journey for me as I have been given a platform where I can earn along with so many skills. With the help of our counselors, and my mentor <NAME OF THE MENTOR>, I have come this way and want to go on for a long time. And with all this, I want to redeem the credits I have earned so far with the help of the EWYL Program.
