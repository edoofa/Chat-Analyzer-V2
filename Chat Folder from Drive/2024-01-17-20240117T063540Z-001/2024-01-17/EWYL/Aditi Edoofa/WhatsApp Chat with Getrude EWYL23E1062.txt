2/1/24, 8:59 AM - Aditi Edoofa: @260972413156 I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
2/1/24, 9:00 AM - +260 96 3297443: Gud morning
2/1/24, 9:02 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning!
2/1/24, 9:08 AM - +260 97 2413156: My long term goals are to be a prosperous programmer who will be working in the highest institutions in the world and the EWYL program will help me earn reduction on the cost that is to be paid for my education in such a way that I'll be eligible to study at the best schools and attain the best education.
2/1/24, 9:10 AM - Aditi Edoofa: That's an incredible vision! 🚀 Becoming a prosperous programmer and working in top-notch institutions worldwide is a fantastic goal.  The EWYL program is indeed a perfect step toward making your dreams more achievable. 🎓
2/1/24, 9:10 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
2/1/24, 9:11 AM - +260 97 2413156: I don't really understand
2/1/24, 9:15 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, let me help you.
2/1/24, 9:15 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
2/1/24, 9:15 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
2/1/24, 9:17 AM - +260 97 2413156: Noted.
2/1/24, 9:17 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
2/1/24, 9:18 AM - +260 97 2413156: Alright madam
2/1/24, 9:19 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
2/1/24, 9:22 AM - +260 97 2413156: Yes
2/1/24, 9:25 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.
2/1/24, 9:26 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/1/24, 9:26 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/1/24, 9:38 AM - +260 97 2413156: I've gone through all the letters
2/1/24, 9:38 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?

4/1/24, 9:14 AM - +260 96 3297443: 🙏
4/1/24, 9:19 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.

4/1/24, 9:45 AM - Aditi Edoofa: We will pause our discussions now and resume at 1:30 PM, okay?
Be on time.
4/1/24, 9:46 AM - +260 97 2413156: Alright.
4/1/24, 1:37 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So are you ready for the session now?🚀
4/1/24, 1:37 PM - +260 97 2413156: Yes
4/1/24, 1:50 PM - Aditi Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
4/1/24, 1:50 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
4/1/24, 2:19 PM - +260 97 2413156: I'm done going through
4/1/24, 2:21 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, that’s wonderful. I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
4/1/24, 2:38 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, we're wrapping up our session. It was a fantastic session, and I'm looking forward to our next session.🌻
4/1/24, 2:39 PM - +260 97 2413156: And from my reading I have gotten to understand that with the EWYL program you can learn yourself money to reduce your costs.How??
Through the connection of yourself to the company or organization this will earn you $20,when you organize a call for EDOOFA mangers and the company this will earn you $2 and if you don't connected to companies instead you can connect to schools and the pupils or students get in enrollment $30 this under the comparative alliance.
And under the community building
Students will reach out to schools like thier on former school and offer them an opportunity to be part of the EDOOFA schoolarship program therefore for every student that gets enrolled and pays thier first enrollment fee the student earns themselves $20 and for the students completion on the Admission formalities on university the students earns themselves $30
And thier is an extra $5 to be earned with the EDOOFA team clarifys everything.
4/1/24, 2:40 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing!
4/1/24, 2:42 PM - +260 97 2413156: Alright thank you.

After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
5/1/24, 8:58 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/1/24, 9:17 AM - +260 97 2413156: When a student is in search of a computer thier things that she needs to consider firstly she needs to consider the nature of the company whether it is a student centric company or it is a receational company.
Secondly I should consider the scale of the company it must not be small or big and you must also consider the employee size which  should range from 50-20
Thirdly the the financial stability a person must select a company which is financially sound.
Lastly is the founder background in this the founder of the company ensures that they have strong background and thier are some steps under this such as search as the first step
5/1/24, 9:25 AM - Aditi Edoofa: You know what, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.

11/1/24, 2:12 PM - +260 97 2413156: Alright I'll definitely do that.
11/1/24, 2:14 PM - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
11/1/24, 2:15 PM - +260 97 2413156: It's Clear
11/1/24, 2:20 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
11/1/24, 2:20 PM - +260 97 2413156: Alright
11/1/24, 2:20 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*GETRUDE/ADITI*
11/1/24, 2:20 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
11/1/24, 2:20 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
11/1/24, 2:21 PM - Aditi Edoofa: ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

11/1/24, 2:28 PM - +260 97 2413156: Noted
11/1/24, 2:31 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
11/1/24, 2:31 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________ a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zambia, where tuition fees range from ZKW 16,000 to ZWL 21,000 per year. When factoring in miscellaneous charges, such as the application fee, student welfare charges, library fees, and other deposits, the cost increases by K5000. Additionally, the cost of living is around K1200 per month.

On average, parents in Zambia spend between ZKW 35,000 and ZKW 40,000 per year at a public university, and sometimes students have to wait for one or two years to secure a spot in their desired course. Speaking to seniors, I realized that I might have to compromise on my course choice at a public university or endure a long wait. As for private universities, the costs are approximately double, making tertiary education unaffordable for my parents.

I have always wanted to support my family by partially funding my education through employment while studying, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn $50-$100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zambia, it's not without its challenges. I followed the 5'S, which helped me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these five pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

15/1/24, 8:43 AM - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

15/1/24, 9:08 AM - +260 97 2413156: Everything is clear.
15/1/24, 9:13 AM - Aditi Edoofa: It’s amazing to be your partner in this EWYL journey. Till now, we’ve spoken to each other about our goals for this year, the promise of earning and learning well through this program, we went over 3 of the projects specially curated for Edoofians to get started with earning scholarship credits and their journey of learning relevant skills like communication, networking, and leadership to name a few.
15/1/24, 9:14 AM - +260 97 2413156: Yes😊
15/1/24, 9:15 AM - Aditi Edoofa: However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!

*So, are you excited to find out what this is?*
15/1/24, 9:15 AM - +260 97 2413156: Yes very much
15/1/24, 9:16 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!
 Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.

16/1/24, 9:11 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
Please note a few things:
FIRST- Please choose your batch for your sessions. Either it has to be 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
or 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
16/1/24, 9:11 AM - +260 97 2413156: Monday and Thursday
16/1/24, 9:13 AM - Aditi Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days you will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
16/1/24, 9:13 AM - Aditi Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
16/1/24, 9:13 AM - Aditi Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
16/1/24, 9:13 AM - Aditi Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Aditi, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
16/1/24, 9:13 AM - Aditi Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
16/1/24, 9:17 AM - +260 97 2413156: Noted let me send the message not.
16/1/24, 9:17 AM - +260 97 2413156: Now*
16/1/24, 9:18 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
16/1/24, 9:18 AM - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
16/1/24, 9:19 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Your session is on *Monday and Thursday from 12:00- 1:30 PM.* In your session, you are required to:
▪️Active participation in most of the sessions by being punctual and actively engaging in the discussions
▪️Follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' on the EWYL Line every day, every morning before 12 PM.
▪️Share your lesson and activity response before your session commences
▪️Sharing project updates
16/1/24, 9:25 AM - +260 97 2413156: Alright noted!
16/1/24, 9:25 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
16/1/24, 9:29 AM - +260 97 2413156: Noted!

I trust that you've gained valuable insights and anticipate that there will be more to come as we progress towards achieving great success. Our next point of contact will be on the EWYL Line during your scheduled sessions and will follow the Proud Edoofian ritual daily.
16/1/24, 9:31 AM - +260 97 2413156: Alright noted ma!
