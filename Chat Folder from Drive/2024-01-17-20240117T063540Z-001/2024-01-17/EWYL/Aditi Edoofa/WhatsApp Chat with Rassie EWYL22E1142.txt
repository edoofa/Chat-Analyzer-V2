Along with you, the Edoofa Family will also be occupied in *New Year Celebrations from tomorrow till 1 January 2024* and we will *resume from 2 January onwards*🎉

Also, I want to ensure that you do not miss out on anything so I would like to reschedule our session on Wednesday from 9:30 to 10:30 AM. Make sure you are on time for your session, okay?

Happy New Year in advance! 🎊

Could you provide details on Rassie's plans to recommence his Earn While You Learn journey? I haven't received any updates or information regarding his intentions to continue. Understanding his plans would be greatly appreciated. <This message was edited>
