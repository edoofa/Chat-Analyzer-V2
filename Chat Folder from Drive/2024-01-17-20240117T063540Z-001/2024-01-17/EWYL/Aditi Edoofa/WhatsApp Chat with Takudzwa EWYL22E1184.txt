5/1/24, 3:11 PM - +91 92053 77167: What are connection
5/1/24, 3:14 PM - Aditi Edoofa: LinkedIn connections are individuals with whom you are connected on the LinkedIn professional networking platform. These connections represent your professional network and can include colleagues, classmates, friends, mentors, industry peers, and other professionals. When you connect with someone on LinkedIn, you gain the ability to see and interact with their posts, updates, and professional information.

The concept of LinkedIn connections is similar to building a network in the physical world. Your connections can introduce you to new opportunities, provide insights into industries, and help you stay informed about professional developments. They also play a crucial role in expanding your reach and visibility within the LinkedIn platform.

Building a meaningful network on LinkedIn involves connecting with individuals strategically, engaging in relevant discussions, and maintaining a professional online presence. The quality of your connections is often more important than the quantity, as a strong network can contribute to your professional growth, career opportunities, and industry knowledge.
