11/01/24, 12:07 pm - +263 77 827 6990: 1) I once heard about the program when l was in high school but l thought it was a scam, but when my friend Timothy recently told me that he had joined the program and he was confident about it l decided to give it a try.

11/01/24, 2:23 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program
Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
11/01/24, 2:23 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.
11/01/24, 2:34 pm - +263 77 827 6990: Thats nice. I like it especially the part about SEELS
11/01/24, 2:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000+ students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200+ schools with more than 250 Headmasters, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza, a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe who is also our associate and is the Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

12/01/24, 11:51 am - +263 77 827 6990: I am 20 years old and l live in Mutare Zimbabwe. My mother has been the one supporting me in my education since O level. She is a single mother. She is a Primary School teacher. Her highest educational level is O level. She is the one who will be supporting me financially abroad for my higher education. I have a little brother and he recently started high school. He is a form one student. My highest education level is A Level & l did my A level at St Dominics High School in Mutare from 2021 - 2022. My fees per term was $130. I would like to practise a medicine course there. I have an interest in becoming a doctor when l grow up, that is what l have always aspired to be ever since l was young.
12/01/24, 12:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Can you also share a bit about the current/previous school you are studying at, How studying at that school helped you in becoming an overall better person, and what all activities did you participated in your school for your holistic growth?
12/01/24, 2:00 pm - +263 77 827 6990: My previous school had the best reputation in the city in terms of good behaviour and best results. It focused on holistic education, with a curriculum that incorporated both academic and personal growth. I participated in extracurricular activities like the school's quiz team, choir, athletics, soccer, basketball and volunteer programs. These activities helped me develop my skills in critical thinking, teamwork and communication. The holistic education I received also taught me the importance of self-reflection and introspection. I learned to be mindful of my thoughts and actions, and to consider how they affect others. This has helped me become more compassionate and understanding of people from different backgrounds and perspective
12/01/24, 2:25 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great answers to both questions, This will help me to guide you better during the course of our Counselling!

This drove my interest in medicine because l have a desire to help people especially in my country. 
Plus l have always been fascinated by the human body and how it works and l want to use my knowledge and skills to improve people's health.
I want to be able to make a difference in the lives of patients and their families and l believe medicine is the key to that

Additionally, students can engage in vibrant campus life, participate in cultural festivals, and experience the rich heritage of India.

7. *Affordability and Scholarships:* Studying in India is more affordable compared to many renowned institutions worldwide. The cost of education is lower, and various scholarships, loans, and financial assistance programs are available to support students.

They can collaborate with experts, contribute to advancements in their fields, and develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

15/01/24, 11:49 am - +263 77 827 6990: That is amazing and interesting
15/01/24, 11:50 am - Shubham Madhwal: You too can achieve all of such success if you decide to give it all, once you come to India to complete your higher education
Because we at Edoofa believe in providing the best to our students, the simple reasoning is that our philosophy is providing Quality Higher Education to a student that will lead to employment in the foreseeable future. 

Now that you are aware, That is why we recommend India for your higher education, Can you explain why you want to study abroad and not in your native country?
15/01/24, 12:15 pm - +263 77 827 6990: Because l want to increase my future employment opportunities globally. I also want to gain new experiences and learn new cultures. I want to develop independence and self-reliance. I also want to make connections with people from all over the world so as to develop future career opportunities and friendships
15/01/24, 12:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
15/01/24, 12:44 pm - +263 77 827 6990: No l haven't
15/01/24, 1:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As you're aware of the fact that you'll be starting your higher education here in India, may I know if you've any Knowledge about the Cost of Education here?
15/01/24, 2:23 pm - +263 77 827 6990: I think its around US$1200 per year <This message was edited>
15/01/24, 2:57 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.
15/01/24, 2:57 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:

1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
15/01/24, 2:57 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *To understand it better, the cost of $2000 to $3000 per year which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester-wise (2 semesters in a year) after the student arrives at the University.*
15/01/24, 2:57 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 3:24 pm - +263 77 827 6990: So after how many semesters will l will be able  to start the earn while you learn program
15/01/24, 3:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Shall I brief you about the same
15/01/24, 4:26 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I will connect with you *tomorrow again at 10 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead.
