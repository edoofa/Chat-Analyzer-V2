04/01/24, 1:09 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program.
04/01/24, 1:09 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
04/01/24, 1:09 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
04/01/24, 1:09 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
04/01/24, 1:10 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
04/01/24, 1:21 pm - +263 77 530 9893: Then Y ask personal questions
04/01/24, 1:41 pm - +263 77 696 3527: So sir is the counseling done
04/01/24, 2:09 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, what is the concern, since it is about evaluating your child's application, I would like to know a bit more about educational background of the family and what is your lookout about higher education in the first place?
04/01/24, 3:24 pm - +263 77 530 9893: My level of education is none of your businesses
04/01/24, 3:31 pm - Gurvinder: Why not Mr Geza, since you are looking forward for your child's higher education. Would you be sharing the same responses if your interview was being held in person for UZ's admission?
06/01/24, 9:34 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

10/01/24, 12:21 pm - +263 77 696 3527: Because in My county in Zimbabwe there are less opportunities
10/01/24, 12:29 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
10/01/24, 12:47 pm - +263 77 696 3527: I want to build schools in my country and build restaurants and hotels so that the pipo in my country will get employment
10/01/24, 12:47 pm - +263 77 696 3527: This message was deleted
10/01/24, 12:50 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Tinashe, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
10/01/24, 12:51 pm - +263 77 696 3527: I agree sir but it's impossible the jobs are not easy to get in our country
10/01/24, 12:56 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
10/01/24, 1:02 pm - +263 77 696 3527: Yes sir
10/01/24, 1:14 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
10/01/24, 1:14 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

10/01/24, 1:40 pm - +263 77 696 3527: Brian Acton is right.if you build for India ,You build for the world 🌎
10/01/24, 1:52 pm - Gurvinder: So now Tinashe, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
10/01/24, 1:54 pm - +263 77 696 3527: I would like to know where the students will stay in India after being selected in the Edoofa scholarship program
10/01/24, 3:33 pm - Gurvinder: The University provides affordable accommodation inside the campus.
10/01/24, 3:39 pm - +263 77 696 3527: Ohh ok
10/01/24, 3:56 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
10/01/24, 4:22 pm - +263 77 696 3527: Mm noo Sir
10/01/24, 4:33 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
10/01/24, 4:33 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
10/01/24, 4:33 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
10/01/24, 4:33 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 4:33 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
10/01/24, 4:38 pm - +263 77 696 3527: This message was deleted
10/01/24, 4:45 pm - +263 77 696 3527: So when I get the scholarship will I still pay the fees
10/01/24, 5:02 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, please.
10/01/24, 5:03 pm - +263 77 696 3527: Ohh 😯
10/01/24, 5:04 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
10/01/24, 5:05 pm - +263 77 696 3527: Ohh ok sir
10/01/24, 5:05 pm - Gurvinder: Tinashe, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
10/01/24, 7:05 pm - +263 77 696 3527: Ohh I see
10/01/24, 8:58 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
11/01/24, 7:55 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
11/01/24, 7:57 am - +263 77 266 2873: Mng
11/01/24, 7:58 am - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
11/01/24, 7:58 am - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
11/01/24, 7:58 am - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

11/01/24, 7:58 am - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
11/01/24, 8:52 am - +263 77 696 3527: Yes I think Mr Tosin Olaitan Oyelade will benefit me it seems he is a great teacher
11/01/24, 9:04 am - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Tinashe, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
11/01/24, 9:07 am - +263 77 696 3527: Ohh $100 per month I see that's a gud salary
11/01/24, 9:08 am - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

11/01/24, 9:08 am - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
11/01/24, 9:12 am - +263 77 696 3527: Ohh wow that's very good Sir now am enthusiastic to join your program
11/01/24, 9:12 am - +263 77 696 3527: Yah I have now realized Sir
11/01/24, 9:29 am - Gurvinder: Alright Tinashe, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
11/01/24, 9:30 am - +263 77 696 3527: Yes sir of course 👍
11/01/24, 9:34 am - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
11/01/24, 9:38 am - +263 77 696 3527: Yes I have Sir
11/01/24, 9:55 am - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
11/01/24, 10:00 am - +263 77 696 3527: Mmm let's say at 12
11/01/24, 10:01 am - Gurvinder: May I know, why?
11/01/24, 10:02 am - +263 77 696 3527: Ok Sir you can do it now I postponed the meeting I had with my friend
11/01/24, 10:10 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
11/01/24, 10:10 am - Gurvinder: Tinashe as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
11/01/24, 10:22 am - +263 77 696 3527: $1500 - $2250
11/01/24, 10:23 am - +263 77 696 3527: Is it per year or per month
11/01/24, 10:23 am - Gurvinder: Exactly Tinashe, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
11/01/24, 10:23 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 10:23 am - Gurvinder: That is for only one time when you apply to an University. <This message was edited>
11/01/24, 10:24 am - +263 77 696 3527: Ohh I see
11/01/24, 10:24 am - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
11/01/24, 10:25 am - +263 77 696 3527: Ohh so now student must pay$350 only
11/01/24, 10:26 am - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
11/01/24, 10:26 am - Gurvinder: Please address this.
11/01/24, 10:27 am - +263 77 696 3527: Yah that's is right Sir very right
11/01/24, 10:28 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
11/01/24, 10:28 am - Gurvinder: Tinashe basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
11/01/24, 10:28 am - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
11/01/24, 10:28 am - +263 77 696 3527: Go on Sir
11/01/24, 10:30 am - +263 77 696 3527: Ohh but me am waiting for my Olevel results not A Level
11/01/24, 11:21 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
11/01/24, 11:21 am - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
11/01/24, 11:22 am - +263 77 696 3527: No Sir
11/01/24, 11:22 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 11:22 am - Gurvinder: Alright Tinashe, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
11/01/24, 11:22 am - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
11/01/24, 11:28 am - +263 77 696 3527: Yes sir I understood
11/01/24, 11:29 am - +263 77 696 3527: But will I make the project or do the assignment alone
11/01/24, 11:31 am - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
11/01/24, 11:31 am - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
11/01/24, 11:31 am - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
11/01/24, 11:31 am - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
11/01/24, 11:31 am - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
11/01/24, 11:39 am - +263 77 696 3527: No Sir
11/01/24, 11:44 am - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check

15/01/24, 8:42 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Set your goals high, and don’t stop till you get there.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
15/01/24, 9:12 am - +263 77 696 3527: Morning Sir
15/01/24, 9:33 am - +263 77 266 2873: Morning sir
15/01/24, 9:58 am - Gurvinder: So Mrs Geza, as Tinashe told me you don't want to go ahead with the program due to some financial issues, may I know, if is that the case, and how can I help you?
15/01/24, 11:52 am - +263 77 266 2873: I can't go ahead because his father is now a pensioner so he de doesn't earn much so my salary only is not enough to pay all the requirements for Tinashe  l have also two kids who are going to school they need busfares and fees.At the mean time we are staying at a government house we don't have our own so l need to build one as l have left with few years to retire
15/01/24, 12:34 pm - Gurvinder: I understand your situation Mrs Geza, and I appreciate your sense of responsibility towards your family but don't you think that Tinashe's higher education should also be a priority as he can help you in achieving your goal of your own house after his education here which present's a lot more job opportunities than the education there in Zimbabwe?
15/01/24, 12:34 pm - Gurvinder: In our quest to provide an education that is affordable, accessible and employable, our Founders have been to African Nations multiple times. Recently during their stay in Zimbabwe in June 2023, they gained valuable insights. Inflation has been a real challenge for Zimbabwean families from the last 20 years.

Until a few years ago, cost of tertiary education in Zimbabwe was affordable for majority of families, however with the recent collapse of the Zimbabwean Dollar, a lot of parents shared their experiences, emphasized the financial challenges of pursuing higher education. In today’s time *Tertiary education expenses in Zimbabwe can amount to approximately $2500-$3500 annually. This surely varies from course to course.*

While the cost of education rose by 25% and is within the range of $1200-$1500 per year, the cost of living is notably high. *Even a basic meal of Sadza and curry can cost a student $1 per serving. This means around $1100 is allocated solely for food, with additional essential costs such as internet which costs around $25-$35 a month, accommodation, and transportation pushing the total to $2000-$2500 per year.
15/01/24, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: This means that he can get an education far superior to your own country at the same expense or lower with the help of the EWYL program. <This message was edited>
15/01/24, 12:37 pm - +263 77 266 2873: Okay how can EWYL help
15/01/24, 12:40 pm - Gurvinder: Please refer to this. <This message was edited>
15/01/24, 9:59 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 10 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
16/01/24, 9:24 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!
