We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
05/01/24, 8:23 pm - +263 78 286 3286: Hey am now online

08/01/24, 8:22 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*"Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
08/01/24, 9:36 am - +263 78 286 3286: What will we have the session
08/01/24, 9:44 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Ashley,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
In order to help me conduct a smooth counseling session, I would appreciate it if you are active for at least 2 hours between *7:30 AM-4:30 PM CAT*.
08/01/24, 10:41 am - +263 78 286 3286: Ok Mr Gurnvider
08/01/24, 10:46 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Ashley, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Munashe, is that correct?
08/01/24, 11:04 am - +263 78 286 3286: Yeah it's correct
08/01/24, 11:06 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Munashe, also do tell me whether you learnt about Munashe’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
08/01/24, 11:09 am - +263 78 286 3286: No l didn't learn about Munashe's journey
08/01/24, 11:10 am - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program myself.
08/01/24, 11:10 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
08/01/24, 11:10 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
08/01/24, 11:10 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
08/01/24, 11:10 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
08/01/24, 11:14 am - +263 78 286 3286: Yeah that what am looking for
08/01/24, 11:18 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Ashley, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
08/01/24, 11:19 am - +263 78 286 3286: Yeah l can be a able to meet the first one but as for the parents am not sure
08/01/24, 11:25 am - Gurvinder: Noted, may I know, why is that the case?
08/01/24, 11:29 am - +263 78 286 3286: They rarely spend their time on their fones
08/01/24, 11:37 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
08/01/24, 11:37 am - Gurvinder: Now Ashley, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?

*“Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the best of which you are capable.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
09/01/24, 11:39 am - +263 78 286 3286: Owky Mr Gurnvider

God Bless You!
09/01/24, 12:53 pm - +263 78 286 3286: Okay have a great day also
10/01/24, 8:40 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*Excuse me for yesterday, I was under the weather and had a bad fever.*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
10/01/24, 9:15 am - +263 78 286 3286: It's ok sir
10/01/24, 9:57 am - Gurvinder: Ashley, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*.
10/01/24, 9:57 am - Gurvinder: You see majority of the time students study subjects as per their country's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics

2. Bachelor of Science in Microbiology

3. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology

4. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology

5. Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy

6. Bachelor of science in Optometry

7. Bachelor of science in Biochemistry

8. Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology
10/01/24, 10:22 am - +263 78 286 3286: I didn't know and l have never thought of any program to do except for medicine and pharmacy
10/01/24, 10:32 am - Gurvinder: Considering your interest in pharmacy, exploring a Bachelor's in Biochemistry could offer you a broader and more comprehensive understanding of the underlying principles governing drugs and their interactions within the human body. While pharmacy focuses on drug dispensing and its application, a degree in Biochemistry delves deeper into the scientific aspects of drugs, exploring their composition, mechanisms of action, and biochemical reactions within biological systems.

Biochemistry as a field not only covers the study of pharmaceuticals but also provides insights into the fundamental molecular processes of life. It equips you with a profound understanding of how biological molecules function, offering a solid foundation in research and development within the pharmaceutical industry. This knowledge is invaluable as it allows you to comprehend drug design, development, and testing processes more thoroughly.

Moreover, a BSc in Biochemistry opens doors to a diverse range of career paths, including pharmaceutical research, biotechnology, healthcare, forensic science, and academia. It provides a versatile skill set applicable across various industries, paving the way for a dynamic and fulfilling career trajectory.
10/01/24, 11:24 am - +263 78 286 3286: Okay
10/01/24, 11:43 am - Gurvinder: So do you think you want go ahead with this course?
10/01/24, 11:44 am - +263 78 286 3286: Yeah I will go ahead with it
10/01/24, 11:58 am - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
10/01/24, 11:58 am - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
10/01/24, 12:10 pm - +263 78 286 3286: Yeah l will achieve that
10/01/24, 12:18 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
10/01/24, 12:23 pm - +263 78 286 3286: Yeah
10/01/24, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: *Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry or B.Sc. Biochemistry (B.Sc. Biochem)* is an undergraduate course in chemical and physio-chemical processes. The course duration is for three years.
10/01/24, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: *B.Sc. Biochem* is a course through which students can find ample job opportunities in the Medical industry, research labs, agriculture, pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions etc. Within these sectors, professionals can find job profiles like that of a Clinical Researcher, Research Scientist, Lecturer, Professor Etc.
 Biochemistry is the study of using Chemical processes and principles in studying biological process and living matter.  It is a branch of science which deals with chemistry which is applied to the study of living organisms and the atoms and molecules which comprise living organisms.
10/01/24, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: *B.Sc. Biochemistry* studies the structure and function of biochemical molecules. The knowledge acquired and skills learned can be applied to varied fields. Some of the sectors which offer employment to B.Sc. Biochemistry graduates are:

*Medical Industry*
*Agriculture*
*Research Labs*
*Pharmaceutical Companies*
*Academic and educational institutions*
*Biotechnologist.*
*Research Scientist.*
*Clinical Scientist.*
*Research Associates.*
*Chemist.*
*Microbiologist.*
*Biomedical Scientist.*
*Pharmacologist.*
10/01/24, 2:47 pm - +263 78 286 3286: Okay
10/01/24, 3:50 pm - Gurvinder: Did you understand the course?
10/01/24, 4:47 pm - +263 78 286 3286: Yeah l understand it but isn't it to weak because all you need is just two A level passes
10/01/24, 5:03 pm - Gurvinder: Please we have reduced the criteria to two passes for every course after COVID.
10/01/24, 5:06 pm - +263 78 286 3286: Eyy as for me l need a powerful program something that requires 10 points or better and am willing to work to have those points not a program that only needs two A level passes but it's ok
10/01/24, 9:14 pm - Gurvinder: Ashley, Biochemistry is one of the most complex and highly pursued courses, the eligibility criteria was set by us lower than normal as students who have a poor background couldn't cope up with the studies after covid, which made it difficult for us to provide students with equal opportunities so that is why we reduced the eligibility criteria.
10/01/24, 9:17 pm - +263 78 286 3286: Ok l understand
11/01/24, 7:55 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

11/01/24, 1:52 pm - +263 78 286 3286: Yeah l understand
11/01/24, 2:04 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
11/01/24, 8:23 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 10 am CAT*.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
15/01/24, 2:32 pm - +263 78 286 3286: We will help others to know they is better education out there and helping other kids to achieve their dreams
15/01/24, 2:44 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Ashley, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
