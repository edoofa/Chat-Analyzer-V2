28/12/23, 11:04 am - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher  education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?

9. Name of your school and the province in which it is located
28/12/23, 12:03 pm - +263 77 544 7266: I'm Shumirai Shoniwa a former student at Kutama Day High School located Zvimba , Mashonaland  West Province ,Zimbabwe. I was raised by maternal grandmother  in Zvimba rural area. My mother passed away  when l was at a very tender age , at the age of 3.My greatest strength is that I can prioritize what needs to be done first today and which tasks can wait until tomorrow. Because of this, I’m efficient with my time management and able to succeed in both school and extracurricular activities. However, my greatest weakness is that I can become too focused on one task and forget about other assignments or projects which need attention. I’ve been working on this by setting reminders in my phone throughout the day. l enjoy netball because that was my sport at school
28/12/23, 12:31 pm - +263 77 544 7266: 1. Name of school: Kutama Day High School 
Location:   Mashonaland West Province 
2. Educational level:  Ordinary level and Advanced Level 
5 Subjects at Ordinary including: English,Science and Mathematics 
Advanced Level subjects: history, shona and divinity
 3. Course to study: Nursing because it offers me an opportunity to help old peoples and children to live longer 
4. My parent is a vendor in a growth point named Murombedzi
5.My parents level of education is standard six. 
6.My grandmother and well wishers are the ones who supported my education 
7. Yes l have siblings .they are at school primary level 
8.I'm looking for scholarships to support my education 
9. My fees per term was $50usd
28/12/23, 12:50 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Noted
28/12/23, 12:50 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now, you mentioned you have younger siblings in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for the family to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are they facing such a situation?
28/12/23, 1:11 pm - +263 77 544 7266: Yes
28/12/23, 1:18 pm - Keshav Edoofa: In that case, how would the family manage the finances involved in your higher education abroad?
28/12/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 544 7266: My family will not be able pay for me to study abroad or put any money towards the studies for that reason I'm looking for scholarship to finance my studies
28/12/23, 3:02 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Shumirai let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
28/12/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 544 7266: In that case I will apply for loan to cover expenses that are not covered by scholarship
28/12/23, 3:21 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Are you sure this would be financially feasible for the family?
28/12/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 544 7266: Yes
28/12/23, 3:24 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Kindly share teh L5 and O LEVEL result pictures
28/12/23, 3:28 pm - +258 84 444 9829: Good afternoon Ms Tushti.I will sell my livestock to help Shumirai with someone of the things she might need at school
28/12/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 544 7266: If l send it tomorrow will it be too late because I'm far from them
28/12/23, 3:42 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Noted

03/01/24, 1:10 pm - +263 77 544 7266: Wow what a positive impact .this makes me more interested
03/01/24, 3:04 pm - Gurvinder: So now @263775447266 , I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
03/01/24, 3:06 pm - +263 77 544 7266: For now l don't have any question
03/01/24, 3:09 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
03/01/24, 3:13 pm - +263 77 544 7266: Yes l know
03/01/24, 3:19 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
03/01/24, 3:19 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
03/01/24, 3:19 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
03/01/24, 3:19 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 3:21 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
03/01/24, 5:51 pm - +263 77 544 7266: Now l have a better understanding of Edoofa program...it's a great opportunity to me.
04/01/24, 8:42 am - +263 77 544 7266: Good morning
04/01/24, 9:39 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

“*It is only when we take chances, when our lives improve*”

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
04/01/24, 10:17 am - +263 77 544 7266: Thank you
04/01/24, 12:34 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
04/01/24, 1:05 pm - +263 77 544 7266: Yes you can
04/01/24, 1:21 pm - Gurvinder: @263775447266 , The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
04/01/24, 2:04 pm - +263 77 544 7266: I understood thank you
04/01/24, 2:06 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
04/01/24, 2:06 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
04/01/24, 2:06 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

04/01/24, 2:07 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
04/01/24, 2:07 pm - +263 77 544 7266: Yes to a greater extent
04/01/24, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that @263775447266, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
04/01/24, 2:18 pm - +263 77 544 7266: Well explained. I understood
04/01/24, 2:20 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

04/01/24, 2:21 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
04/01/24, 2:22 pm - +263 77 544 7266: Yes it is
04/01/24, 2:23 pm - Gurvinder: Alright @263775447266 , now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
04/01/24, 2:29 pm - +263 77 544 7266: Yes they are the ones
04/01/24, 2:30 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
04/01/24, 2:37 pm - +263 77 544 7266: Yes they know
04/01/24, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
04/01/24, 2:42 pm - +263 77 544 7266: Yes l Am
04/01/24, 2:42 pm - Gurvinder: @263775447266 as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
04/01/24, 2:48 pm - +263 77 544 7266: $1500-$2250
04/01/24, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly @263775447266 , and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
04/01/24, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 3:48 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
04/01/24, 4:51 pm - +263 77 544 7266: Yes my facing network challenges
04/01/24, 5:01 pm - +263 77 544 7266: OK so instead of paying 750 we are now paying 350
05/01/24, 1:22 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
05/01/24, 1:22 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
05/01/24, 1:35 pm - +263 77 544 7266: It's true
05/01/24, 1:36 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
05/01/24, 1:36 pm - Gurvinder: @263775447266 basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
05/01/24, 1:36 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
05/01/24, 1:39 pm - +263 77 544 7266: Understood
05/01/24, 1:43 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
05/01/24, 1:46 pm - +263 77 544 7266: No I'm not
05/01/24, 1:49 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 1:50 pm - Gurvinder: Alright @263775447266 , so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
05/01/24, 1:50 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
05/01/24, 2:02 pm - +263 77 544 7266: I understood. I have a question, since we are on stage one is it possible to make changes on the programme
05/01/24, 2:08 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, what do you want to do?
05/01/24, 2:17 pm - +263 77 544 7266: At first l wanted to do nursing, but l didn't  meet your requirements ..since am a degree  holder in rural and urban planning I'm thinking of upgrading myself..l want to acquire a masters degree in that field.
05/01/24, 2:26 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, but why a master's in that only, don't you think that doing an MBA would be more beneficial for you as it is a more globally recognized degree and will also help you to start your own business regarding rural and urban planning?
05/01/24, 2:38 pm - +263 77 544 7266: Yes it's good but  l have a passion of being a planner and it is always my wish to further my studies in the field..In Zimbabwe if l manage to acquire a masters in rural and urban planning l have the opportunity to get a high paying job and will be eligible to start my own business at one time.
05/01/24, 2:42 pm - Gurvinder: Shumiey, you already have the knowledge of being a planner through your bachelor's, but doing an *MBA in International Business* will make you more diverse and will make you reach the heights of your career.
05/01/24, 3:00 pm - +263 77 544 7266: OK thank. you can you please explain for me what is it all about ,what are the benefits
05/01/24, 3:00 pm - Gurvinder: *MBA in International Business* is a two year post graduate degree in management.
The objective of the course is to help professionalize the foreign trade management of country and increasing exports and imports by generating, analyzing and conducting research. MBA IB course mainly focuses on developing a capable workforce within the country who has a complete understanding of the changing international business scenarios so that they can weigh and analyze the impact of those changes in the domestic market.
05/01/24, 3:00 pm - Gurvinder: MBA IB graduates have immense opportunity in the current market.  Career options after this course are increasing so rapidly. International business degree holders are often required due to increasing globalization and the growing number of businesses currently competing on the international stage
05/01/24, 3:01 pm - Gurvinder: Following are the functional areas for MBA IB graduates-

*Export Import Management*

05/01/24, 3:59 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
05/01/24, 8:03 pm - +263 77 544 7266: It's well explained
06/01/24, 10:09 am - +263 77 544 7266: Good morning
06/01/24, 10:39 am - Gurvinder: So what do you think, do you want to pursue MBA now?

06/01/24, 11:27 am - Gurvinder: Noted, let me continue now.
06/01/24, 11:27 am - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
06/01/24, 11:27 am - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
06/01/24, 11:28 am - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
06/01/24, 11:28 am - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
06/01/24, 11:33 am - +263 77 544 7266: No .I understood
06/01/24, 11:42 am - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
