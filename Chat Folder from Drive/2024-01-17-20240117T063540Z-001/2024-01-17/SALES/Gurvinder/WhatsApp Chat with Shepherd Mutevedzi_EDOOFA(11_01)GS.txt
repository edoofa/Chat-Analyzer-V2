We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
11/01/24, 1:44 pm - +263 78 999 3460: Afternoon 
You have indeed contacted the right person (people)
11/01/24, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Shepherd,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

11/01/24, 3:28 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Shepherd, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Tapiwanashe, is that correct?

11/01/24, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Tapiwanashe, also do tell me whether you learnt about Tapiwanashe’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?

12/01/24, 9:07 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
12/01/24, 9:51 am - +263 78 999 3460: Edoofa is a scholarship program that was designed specifically because of the belief thag every child should have access to quality education.
Its benefits over Zimbabwean Universities are it assists or pays tuition fees for students who are in someway unable to pay tuition fees at Universities in their countries and that students can earn money ranging from 50 to 100 dollars while studying.
12/01/24, 9:51 am - +263 78 999 3460: No she didn't tell me about her experience
12/01/24, 10:33 am - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program myself.
12/01/24, 10:33 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
12/01/24, 10:33 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/01/24, 10:33 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
12/01/24, 10:33 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
12/01/24, 11:21 am - +263 78 999 3460: Yes that's it
12/01/24, 12:08 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Shepherd, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
12/01/24, 10:28 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
13/01/24, 7:51 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

15/01/24, 9:50 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.

16/01/24, 10:57 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are in good health.

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application. Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further.
