29/12/23, 2:01 pm - Kunal: Amazing!
As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education  which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
29/12/23, 2:05 pm - +265 888 04 69 95: No sir can you tell me how it cost
29/12/23, 2:09 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
29/12/23, 2:10 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 2:10 pm - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
29/12/23, 2:19 pm - +265 888 04 69 95: Sir does students who have been taken for scholarships pay fees as well
29/12/23, 2:20 pm - Kunal: Can you elaborate on this?
29/12/23, 2:31 pm - +265 888 04 69 95: Is a question after Edoofa scholarship does parents pay some fees
29/12/23, 2:39 pm - Kunal: Edoofa Scholarship Program offers 50-100% scholarship on tuition fees. The remaining cost after scholarship and cost of Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family
29/12/23, 2:41 pm - +265 888 04 69 95: OK now I have understood
29/12/23, 2:44 pm - Kunal: Let me help you understand more on *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
29/12/23, 2:44 pm - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
29/12/23, 2:44 pm - Kunal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
29/12/23, 2:44 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
29/12/23, 2:44 pm - Kunal: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
29/12/23, 2:44 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 2:44 pm - Kunal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
29/12/23, 2:44 pm - Kunal: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
29/12/23, 2:50 pm - +265 888 04 69 95: Yes sir it seems to be part of business right
29/12/23, 2:51 pm - Kunal: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
29/12/23, 2:57 pm - +265 888 04 69 95: This message was deleted
29/12/23, 2:58 pm - +265 888 04 69 95: Your right sir we have a big chance to learn at a low cost but it will only depend on our hard working spirit
29/12/23, 3:18 pm - Kunal: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
29/12/23, 3:18 pm - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
29/12/23, 3:18 pm - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
29/12/23, 3:18 pm - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different.
Let me know which point out of 4 you like the most
29/12/23, 3:25 pm - +265 888 04 69 95: Point 1and 3
29/12/23, 3:28 pm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and employability.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

29/12/23, 3:28 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
29/12/23, 3:42 pm - +265 888 04 69 95: My father
29/12/23, 3:45 pm - Kunal: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
29/12/23, 3:49 pm - +265 888 04 69 95: There extremely exerted and they both wish me luck
29/12/23, 3:50 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at even a greater pace, as you will be transformed to a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family thereby yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle free life to your parents.
29/12/23, 3:50 pm - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
29/12/23, 3:57 pm - +265 888 04 69 95: A student  herself have to be well displined and hardworking in order for her to be applied
29/12/23, 3:58 pm - Kunal: Indeed
*When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
29/12/23, 3:59 pm - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
29/12/23, 3:59 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 4:02 pm - +265 888 04 69 95: That was  a good  thought
29/12/23, 4:04 pm - Kunal: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their MSCE result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final MSCE results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
29/12/23, 4:04 pm - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
The Foster and Care throughout your course
29/12/23, 4:04 pm - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
29/12/23, 4:11 pm - +265 888 04 69 95: Will i start learning this program of Earn While You Learn before writing my MSCE exams
29/12/23, 4:11 pm - Kunal: Yes Faith
You will be starting the EWYL program while being in your country and making your education affordable
29/12/23, 4:11 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 4:14 pm - +265 888 04 69 95: Stage 6 sir
29/12/23, 4:15 pm - Kunal: That is right.We had very well covered till the Acceptance Letter and Enrollment formalities which is in stage 4.Even though we had mentioned stages 5 and 6 briefly we are left with some more information from the last two stages
So shall I explain it to you
29/12/23, 4:15 pm - +265 888 04 69 95: Yes sir you can
29/12/23, 4:16 pm - Kunal: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
29/12/23, 4:16 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.


I hope you are clear with the process.
29/12/23, 4:22 pm - +265 888 04 69 95: No sir is ($500-$1000) fee for registration only
29/12/23, 4:25 pm - Kunal: *Registration Fee*
The registration fee($500-$1000) is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. 

*The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived from the cost of education.*
 
For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $2200 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $2200-600= $1600 <This message was edited>
29/12/23, 4:26 pm - +265 888 04 69 95: OK sir
29/12/23, 4:35 pm - Kunal: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -

Our students will be given online projects related to Researching, Content writing, Managing and Leading People, Community Building, Digital Marketing and many more. Based on their performance students can Earn Scholarship credits and reduce their fees. This fee will not be physical cash rather it would be reduced from the cost of education directly

All these projects are performed on online platforms and our EWYL mentors will be guiding them. The working hours are flexible and students can invest their free time.

01/01/24, 6:18 pm - +265 888 04 69 95: For my own understanding Edoofa offers 50-100% scholarship the lest is done by parents
01/01/24, 6:21 pm - Austin: That is right, as per the discussions during the session, what would be the reduced cost of education after the scholarship?
01/01/24, 6:23 pm - +265 888 04 69 95: When you joined Earn While You Learn they reduce some 10 if not 20%
01/01/24, 6:28 pm - Austin: Indeed and let me help you here
The annual fee after the scholarship is $2000-$3000

Even though, the cost of education through the Edoofa Scholarship ranges from $2000-$3000 per annum, based on your performance in the eligibility check stage and evaluation of our Admissions team, you can be considered for a higher quantum of scholarship which can reduce the costs even below $2000 inclusive of tuition and living.
01/01/24, 6:32 pm - +265 888 04 69 95: That's more like it i think now nothing will stop me from becoming a member of Edoofa what's needed now is hard working
01/01/24, 6:37 pm - Austin: I understand Faith, have you considered the cost of education with that of Malawi?
01/01/24, 6:38 pm - +265 888 04 69 95: No sir
01/01/24, 6:45 pm - Austin: <Media omitted>
01/01/24, 6:45 pm - Austin: Yearly that is :
Accommodation yearly- MK500, 000
Food yearly- MK300, 000 
WiFi-it depends on how bundles are 
Upkeep- MK450, 000
Total- MK 1,250,000 and above
01/01/24, 6:45 pm - Austin: Faith, we have a lot of students from Malawi who apply for their higher education for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. There are students who have discontinued their course in Malawi and are now a part of the Edoofa program because the cost of education is lower than that of Malawi
01/01/24, 6:46 pm - Austin: We also have students who applied for Masters and they have shared their Bachelors fee break up in Malawi and it was around $2000 including tuition,, food, Accommodation, Wifi, etc. This is an example given by one such student and the fee notification from UNIMA. 

Now, I have gone through your discussions and academic background of yours and you can even be recommended for a higher quantum of scholarship based on your performance and evaluation of our Admissions Team.
01/01/24, 6:47 pm - Austin: For example, if your cost of education after the Edoofa Scholarship Program is $1600 per annum and you earn at least $70 through the Earn While you Learn Program making a total of $840 per annum.

The remaining annual fees would be $1600-$840= $760 which can be paid in two equal installments.
01/01/24, 6:47 pm - Austin: This is just an example and students have even earned more than $400 per month and self financed their higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
01/01/24, 6:50 pm - +265 888 04 69 95: I can't wait for a little longer to start my education to India sir
01/01/24, 6:52 pm - Austin: That is great to hear and I believe you will give your best in the upcoming procedures!
01/01/24, 6:52 pm - Austin: So, before we move  to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While you Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
01/01/24, 7:44 pm - +265 888 04 69 95: I am taking one of the best in the medical field and this is B. Sc of physiotherapy, I prefer doing my studies in India because there best teachers who makes one to understand, and for the amount cost for the students without scholarship it cost is very higher this is because they provide them with education, food and some of the resources needed. If found eligible annual fee paid the parent pay part of the fee in 7 days and finish the remain within the 30 days. $200 is paid in 7 days while the remaining $150 is paid in 30 days.
                                           
 Earn While You Learn program is a project on different platforms that offer credit to Edoofian which is used to reduce the cost of fees for a student this loan is not physically paid rather the costs of education directly reduced.
01/01/24, 7:46 pm - +265 888 04 69 95: That's all I can explain sir
01/01/24, 7:52 pm - Austin: You are yet to answer 3,4 and 7
01/01/24, 8:21 pm - +265 888 04 69 95: The average cost for a student studying without a scholarship in an international country is $6000-$8000
The amount needed to be paid is $350
Yes i am clear that fee will be used for the needs which     I will be given the first day
01/01/24, 8:24 pm - +265 888 38 03 13: As per your statement if am not making mistake you said range between $2000 _$3000 per annum, with my budget as a Father l can try my best $1500 to $2000 per annum.
01/01/24, 8:41 pm - Austin: The average cost of education in India is $6000-$8000
The annual fee after the scholarship is $2000-$3000

Even though, the cost of education through the Edoofa Scholarship ranges from $2000-$3000 per annum, based on your performance in the eligibility check stage and evaluation of our Admissions team, you can be considered for a higher quantum of scholarship which can reduce the costs even below $2000 inclusive of tuition and living.

01/01/24, 8:54 pm - Austin: I really understand and let us hope for the best!
01/01/24, 8:55 pm - Austin: If we begin the eligibility check stage of your child tomorrow, it would be of 1-2 days after which the results will be out which means if your child qualifies for the Edoofa Scholarship, the due date for the first part of the enrollment fee ($200)will fall on the next week of January. Are you confident and comfortable with the timeframe?
