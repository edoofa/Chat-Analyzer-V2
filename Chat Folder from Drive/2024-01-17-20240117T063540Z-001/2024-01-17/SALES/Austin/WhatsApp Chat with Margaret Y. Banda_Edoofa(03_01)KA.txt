04/01/24, 10:28 am - Kunal: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
04/01/24, 10:36 am - +265 984 61 34 66: Studying in India will help me to realise my dream and to become an influential person in my country and to the world at large.
04/01/24, 10:39 am - Kunal: Amazing!
As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education  which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
04/01/24, 10:41 am - +265 984 61 34 66: No unless I ask my dad
04/01/24, 10:44 am - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
04/01/24, 10:44 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 10:44 am - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
04/01/24, 10:51 am - +265 984 61 34 66: Yes
04/01/24, 11:04 am - Kunal: Good to know that
Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the 

*Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
04/01/24, 11:05 am - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
04/01/24, 11:05 am - Kunal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
04/01/24, 11:05 am - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
04/01/24, 11:05 am - Kunal: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
04/01/24, 11:05 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 11:05 am - Kunal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
04/01/24, 11:05 am - Kunal: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
04/01/24, 11:13 am - +265 984 61 34 66: It's a yes to me because it's a welcomed development
04/01/24, 11:23 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 11:23 am - Kunal: Absolutely,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. _This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.
04/01/24, 11:29 am - +265 984 61 34 66: It's a good initiative helping parents and I like and looking forward to join
04/01/24, 11:39 am - Kunal: Good to hear that
04/01/24, 11:39 am - Kunal: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
04/01/24, 11:39 am - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
04/01/24, 11:39 am - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
04/01/24, 11:39 am - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different.

However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
04/01/24, 11:54 am - +265 984 61 34 66: My parents
04/01/24, 11:54 am - Kunal: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
04/01/24, 11:58 am - +265 984 61 34 66: Thanks a lot and about my family, they are extremely happy that I will be studying abroad
04/01/24, 11:58 am - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at even a greater pace, as you will be transformed to a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family thereby yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle free life to your parents.
04/01/24, 11:58 am - Kunal: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
04/01/24, 12:05 pm - +265 984 61 34 66: Yes police clearance report clearing my criminal record
04/01/24, 12:06 pm - Kunal: Absolutely, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*
04/01/24, 12:06 pm - Kunal: *Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
04/01/24, 12:06 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 12:08 pm - +265 984 61 34 66: Yes go on
04/01/24, 12:10 pm - Kunal: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
04/01/24, 12:10 pm - Kunal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
04/01/24, 12:15 pm - +265 984 61 34 66: Ok noted
04/01/24, 12:19 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 12:38 pm - +265 984 61 34 66: As for now I know all pertaining to the cycle
04/01/24, 12:40 pm - +265 984 61 34 66: You have taken me through all the processes
04/01/24, 12:46 pm - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
04/01/24, 12:48 pm - +265 984 61 34 66: Yes explain it
04/01/24, 12:50 pm - Kunal: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
04/01/24, 12:50 pm - Kunal: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
04/01/24, 12:50 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
04/01/24, 12:54 pm - +265 984 61 34 66: Yes it's very clear
04/01/24, 2:27 pm - Kunal: Alright, we have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
04/01/24, 2:27 pm - Kunal: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*
04/01/24, 2:27 pm - Kunal: *Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

Did you manage to discuss the Edoofa Program with your family, please?

05/01/24, 2:31 pm - Kunal: Greetings, Mr Robings
May I know if you have gone through the aspects in the counseling session above?
05/01/24, 2:33 pm - +265 999 60 94 27: I have been following your discussion with my daughter. Greetings
05/01/24, 2:39 pm - Kunal: Alright Mr Robings
Let me please help you with the financial aspects of the program. 

*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library fee etc. It is paid in two equal instalments, each instalment before a semester. 


This cost can be further reduced by you through the earnings from the Earn While You Learn program

*Enrollment fee*
For all the services and assistance including Applications to Universities, Statement of Purpose, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection and sessions, Earn While you Learn program and training, etc all you have is $350 which can either be paid in two phases($200 in 7 days and remaining within the next 30 days) or together <This message was edited>
05/01/24, 2:39 pm - Kunal: *Registration Fee*
The registration fee($500-$100) is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. 

*The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived from the cost of education.*
 
For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $2200 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $2200-600= $1600

The cost of transportation and visa application is catered by a student's family <This message was edited>
05/01/24, 2:41 pm - +265 999 60 94 27: Well noted my brother...you may proceed with the session
05/01/24, 2:45 pm - Kunal: Even though, the cost of education through the Edoofa Scholarship ranges from $2000-$3000 per annum, based on the student's performance in the eligibility check stage and evaluation of our Admissions team, you can be considered for a higher quantum of scholarship which can reduce the costs even below $2000 inclusive of tuition and living.
05/01/24, 2:45 pm - Kunal: Since Margaret has performed well in the Academics and sessions so far, I will be recommending her for a higher quantum of scholarship which would also depend on the evaluation during interviews and of our Admissions Team
05/01/24, 2:46 pm - +265 999 60 94 27: Wow! Noted
05/01/24, 2:47 pm - +265 999 60 94 27: Alright my brother
05/01/24, 2:47 pm - Kunal: Well Margaret
Before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me?

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
05/01/24, 2:48 pm - +265 999 60 94 27: I will be coming in only where I feel to answer on her behalf as a parent.
05/01/24, 2:53 pm - +265 984 61 34 66: Give some time so that I can go through the questions to give right answers
05/01/24, 2:54 pm - Kunal: That would be fine, please
05/01/24, 3:27 pm - +265 984 61 34 66: 1. Bachelor of commerce 

2. India 

3. USD 6000-USD 8000

4. USD 2000-USD 3000

5. USD 350 if found eligible you will pay USD 200 in 7 days then the remaining USD 150 within 30 days 

6. In my own understanding I take this as a scholarship whereby a student is given an opportunity to earn while he or she is studying in a particular university which helps him or her to contribute to his or her annual fee thereby reducing the cost of fee which parents are supposed to pay per year.To add on that if a student is doing well he or she is also
 given a chance to proceed with masters degree etc.

7. Yes am it's clear Mr kunal
