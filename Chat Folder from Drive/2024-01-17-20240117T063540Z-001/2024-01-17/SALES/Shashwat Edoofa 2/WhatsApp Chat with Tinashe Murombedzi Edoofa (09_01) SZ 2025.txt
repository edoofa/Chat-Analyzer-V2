10/01/24, 12:58 pm - +263 78 274 0989: Both parents ,mother and father supports  Tinashe 's  education
10/01/24, 1:01 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since pursuing higher education is a significant undertaking that demands both mental and financial support, may I know who will be financially supporting Tinashe's education abroad?
10/01/24, 1:23 pm - +263 78 274 0989: Both parents will be responsible and supporting  mental and financial. However we are appealing for sponsorship  if possible
10/01/24, 1:31 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mrs. Simangele. May I know what is your understanding of the term "sponsorship", please?
10/01/24, 1:46 pm - +263 78 274 0989: sponsorship according to my understanding is financial  support from a sponsor . In this case we are appealing for financial support from Edoofa for our son to fulfill his dream. Our incomes are very low to suit his needs. Thank you.
10/01/24, 1:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually you are mistaken over here, Let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now A lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
10/01/24, 2:32 pm - +263 78 274 0989: Oh l see the difference between the two .ln this case this program is scholarship.ls it so.Thank you for explaining further .
10/01/24, 2:34 pm - +263 78 274 0989: Sorry to bother you ,how are the terms and conditions of the programs . Fees structure and services.
10/01/24, 2:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly elaborate on your concerns, please?
10/01/24, 2:49 pm - +263 78 274 0989: Am following
10/01/24, 2:49 pm - +263 78 274 0989: In terms of fees structure and accomodation.Affordability
10/01/24, 3:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 4:35 pm - +263 71 854 2081: Thank you so much, I just believe in developing myself into a better version of myself, regardless of the financial backdrop I have , alas it's the love for the verbal art for me that keeps me going. Again , thank you I truly appreciate it

11/01/24, 10:59 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: It will be my utmost pleasure to guide you through the process, Mr. Michael, and Mrs. Simangele! May I know who will be financially supporting Tinashe with his tertiary education abroad, please?
11/01/24, 11:16 am - +263 77 248 9624: We will both be responsible for his financial obligations as his parents.
11/01/24, 11:30 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Michael and Mrs. Simangele. You are extraordinary parents, consistently providing unwavering support, guidance, and encouragement, and your dedication to Tinashe's well-being is truly admirable!

11/01/24, 12:34 pm - +263 78 274 0989: Am sending O level results and he is currently doing upper level expected to write final exam 2024
11/01/24, 12:45 pm - +263 77 248 9624: Tinashe has done well at school from primary level to secondary level where he passed all the subjects he sat for at O Level with 3 As and 6 Bs. He is completing his A level this year 2024, we will share his certificates. He is very well behaved and has shown very high academic leadership qualities, has a sharp analytical mind and is a good decision maker. He is a very good communicator and has a passion for developing, not only himself but others and the community as evidenced by the various positions he has held in various clubs and some he is currently holding now at school. The deteriorating education system, lack of state of the art educational facilities, congested institutions of learning and compromised education boards are push factors which have made us look for better institutions abroad.
11/01/24, 1:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I truly admire your vision, Mr. Michael, and Mrs. Simangele! Exposure to foreign tertiary education offers numerous advantages. It broadens students' horizons by introducing them to diverse cultures and perspectives, improving language skills, and providing a global outlook. They gain access to world-class academic institutions, form international networks, and develop invaluable personal and professional skills. This experience fosters personal growth, enhances career prospects, and cultivates global citizenship. In essence, studying abroad is a transformative journey that equips students with the knowledge, skills, and perspective needed to thrive in our interconnected world!
