2)How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
04/01/24, 4:58 pm - +263 78 199 1982: 1) India is a rapidly growing country with a thriving economy ,so there are many opportunities for those with an education and experience in India .Also India is a culturally diverse country with a rich history and heritage, which can be a valuable asset in the global marketplace. More so, studying in lndia can help develop important skills like adptability,cultural sensitivity and communication skills

I will network with other students and professionals in the field, and to take advantage of any opportunities for the internships or work experience Lastly, l will stay motivated and determined , and never give up on my goals
04/01/24, 5:16 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is remarkable, Violet. I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students are capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.
04/01/24, 5:16 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you on *tomorrow again at 10:00 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

Have a good night
God Bless You!
05/01/24, 10:26 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263781991982 @263775679972 , Hope you are doing well.
05/01/24, 10:26 am - Garima Edoofa: I am here to continue with your counseling session, shall we start?
05/01/24, 10:49 am - +263 78 199 1982: Morning
05/01/24, 10:49 am - +263 78 199 1982: Yes
05/01/24, 12:03 pm - Garima Edoofa: Amazing Violet
 
As far as I can tell, you recognise Edoofa's commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their study, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of  similar quality higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
05/01/24, 12:07 pm - +263 78 199 1982: No
05/01/24, 12:12 pm - Garima Edoofa: @263781991982let me share with you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly .
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc.It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,gym,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
05/01/24, 12:16 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 12:26 pm - +263 78 199 1982: Yes we can afford it
05/01/24, 12:29 pm - Garima Edoofa: However, If you meet and exceed our academic criteria with a high passing grade, you become eligible for the exclusive 90-100% scholarship. With the 90-100% Scholarship, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1200-$1800, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc!
05/01/24, 12:29 pm - Garima Edoofa: Do you feel it is affordable for your family?
05/01/24, 12:32 pm - +263 78 199 1982: Yes
05/01/24, 12:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: Well,Violet. Our support doesn't stop there! Edoofa also offers an innovative *Earn While You Learn Program. This program allows you to further reduce your remaining fees by gaining practical work experience while studying. It not only eases the financial burden but also provides you with valuable skills and industry exposure, enhancing your employability and ensuring a well-rounded education.

With Edoofa's 90-100% Scholarship and the opportunity to earn while you learn, you can focus on your studies, explore your field of interest, and prepare for a successful career.

So do you want me to guide you about the Earn while you learn program in depth?
05/01/24, 12:35 pm - +263 78 199 1982: Yes please
05/01/24, 12:38 pm - Garima Edoofa: @263781991982The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
05/01/24, 12:38 pm - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
05/01/24, 12:38 pm - Garima Edoofa: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
05/01/24, 12:38 pm - Garima Edoofa: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*
_How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer!_ by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu*
_It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship_ by *Mr. Ronard Kachaje*
_Decoding the science of personal branding_ by *Mr, Simon Maingi*
05/01/24, 12:40 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 12:40 pm - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
05/01/24, 12:49 pm - +263 78 199 1982: My views are that with Edoofa my chances of getting employment or being an independent lady are successful as i have observed from the above and i also think that will benefit me a lot
05/01/24, 12:52 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that Violet, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
05/01/24, 12:52 pm - Garima Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.
05/01/24, 12:53 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 12:56 pm - +263 78 199 1982: I am very delighted because this is exactly what i have been looking for regarding my international education
05/01/24, 12:58 pm - Garima Edoofa: In our quest to provide an education that is affordable, accessible and employable, our Founders have been to African Nations multiple times. Recently during their stay in Zimbabwe in June 2023, they gained valuable insights. Inflation has been a real challenge for Zimbabwean families from the last 20 years.

Until a few years ago, cost of tertiary education in Zimbabwe was affordable for majority of families, however with the recent collapse of the Zimbabwean Dollar, a lot of parents shared their experiences, emphasized the financial challenges of pursuing higher education. In today’s time *Tertiary education expenses in Zimbabwe can amount to approximately $2500-$3500 annually. This surely varies from course to course.*

While the cost of education rose by 25% and is within the range of $1200-$1500 per year, the cost of living is notably high. *Even a basic meal of Sadza and curry can cost a student $1 per serving. This means around $1100 is allocated solely for food, with additional essential costs such as internet which costs around $25-$35 a month, accommodation, and transportation pushing the total to $2000-$2500 per year.
05/01/24, 1:03 pm - +263 78 199 1982: noted
05/01/24, 1:06 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope you have understood that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is not merely a platform for students to gain admission to an internationally recognized university. It offers much more. Among various differentiators, the value provided by Edoofa to a particular student surpasses that offered by any admission agent or consultant.
05/01/24, 1:07 pm - Garima Edoofa: You see during our founder’s visit this year, we encountered Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program in 2018-2019 but hadn't proceeded due to the lure of quick earnings within the country. However, this year, those student shared their hardships, with some holding prestigious degrees from institutions like UZ, MSU, and HIT, now working as petrol attendants or mobile/laptop repair technicians. Others faced even greater challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

It's evident from these experiences that many students regret not taking the benefit of The Edoofa Program's opportunity earlier. As your counselor, I understand the challenges in your home country. What are your thoughts or insights on this situation, Violet?
05/01/24, 1:13 pm - Garima Edoofa: @263781991982
05/01/24, 1:25 pm - +263 78 199 1982: The fact that these people were seen as capable by the Edoofa program gives them the experience and knowledge to be independent even without having studied abroad as they desired.Lack of financial support does not put their guard down as they can also use their knowledge Edoofa program had provided.Yes,we face a lot of financial challenges in our country but considering the knowledge students had received from Edoofa program they can use their experience to be financially independent people
05/01/24, 1:42 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
05/01/24, 1:43 pm - +263 78 199 1982: Yes
05/01/24, 1:44 pm - Garima Edoofa: Violet as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
05/01/24, 1:47 pm - +263 78 199 1982: $1 500-$2 250
05/01/24, 1:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: Exactly Violet, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
05/01/24, 1:49 pm - +263 78 199 1982: noted
05/01/24, 1:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 1:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
05/01/24, 1:50 pm - +263 78 199 1982: Yes i think so
05/01/24, 1:51 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
05/01/24, 1:51 pm - Garima Edoofa: Violet basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
05/01/24, 1:51 pm - Garima Edoofa: However Violet @263781991982, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
05/01/24, 1:53 pm - +263 78 199 1982: Ok i have understood
05/01/24, 1:55 pm - Garima Edoofa: so now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
05/01/24, 2:00 pm - +263 78 199 1982: Edoofa program helps students arrange and pay finances by themselves through the Earn While you Learn program
05/01/24, 2:02 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you
*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications,SOP,Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions etc all you need to pay is $350
 
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee,Accommodation,Food,Wifi,Laundry,Library,Gym fee etc!  Additionally if you are found eligible for higher quantum of scholarship then cost will go down to $1200-$1800 
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
05/01/24, 2:03 pm - +263 78 199 1982: Noted
05/01/24, 2:08 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 2:18 pm - +263 78 199 1982: I have already discussed stage 01-05
05/01/24, 2:20 pm - Garima Edoofa: Well , 
We had also discussed the Acceptance Letter which a student  receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is the stage 4.

*In Step 1:Connect with counselor-* As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
05/01/24, 2:20 pm - +263 78 199 1982: Yes
05/01/24, 2:24 pm - Garima Edoofa: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.
05/01/24, 2:24 pm - Garima Edoofa: August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India. <This message was edited>

05/01/24, 2:30 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

05/01/24, 2:31 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
05/01/24, 2:31 pm - Garima Edoofa: And for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have.
05/01/24, 2:31 pm - Garima Edoofa: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session.

As a single parent of two daughters and a small-scale farmer, how did she successfully manage her responsibilities? Additionally, how did Edoofa assist her in overcoming any challenges she encountered, and what was her experience throughout the process?
06/01/24, 10:08 am - +263 78 199 1982: Yes yes we connected with her
06/01/24, 10:47 am - Garima Edoofa: May I know what you discussed with Mrs. Ruth?
06/01/24, 11:03 am - +263 78 199 1982: She guaranteed me that the Edoofa program was trustworthy.she was also telling me that the EWYL program really helped her a lot..she also told me about the fees and that the fees you pay the balance that would be left after getting the scholarship... she asured me that it was at first a scary start because it was her first time with Edoofa but in the end it was all worth it
06/01/24, 11:08 am - Garima Edoofa: Yes, Indeed violet.                                                                                                                                                                              You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .

You are supposed to acknowledge the result via Email and go through your Acceptance Letter properly. Did you do the same?
12/01/24, 10:46 am - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 3:41 pm - +263 78 199 1982: Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity... I promise to not let you down😇

12/01/24, 3:48 pm - +263 78 199 1982: Date of Birth should be 24 October 2006
12/01/24, 3:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did you not fill it correct in your form ?
12/01/24, 3:49 pm - +263 78 199 1982: I did
13/01/24, 12:13 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
13/01/24, 12:15 pm - +263 77 567 9972: Morning hw are you
13/01/24, 1:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: But the details were taken from the form itself
13/01/24, 1:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Let me correct it in records .
13/01/24, 1:02 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Apart from that do you have nay questions for me?
13/01/24, 2:31 pm - +263 78 199 1982: Ok
13/01/24, 2:31 pm - +263 78 199 1982: No l dont have
15/01/24, 9:18 am - Sahil Edoofa: Great so let me guide you about the payment modes in depth .
15/01/24, 9:18 am - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
15/01/24, 9:18 am - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828
