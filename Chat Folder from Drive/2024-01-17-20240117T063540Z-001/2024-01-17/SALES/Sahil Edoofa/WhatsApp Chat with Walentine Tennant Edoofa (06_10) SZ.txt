06/10/23, 7:01 pm - +263 77 590 5556: If I may ask, is it possible to apply for the scholarship before having my A level results or I must wait until they are out?
06/10/23, 7:02 pm - +91 82875 72068: A delightful evening to you, Welentine! I hope you are having a wonderful day!
06/10/23, 7:02 pm - +91 82875 72068: Certainly, Walentine. It is indeed.
06/10/23, 7:03 pm - +263 77 590 5556: Is the scholarship a partial or full one?
06/10/23, 7:04 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, Walentine, may I know what is your understanding of the term "Full Scholarship"?
06/10/23, 7:05 pm - +263 77 590 5556: Fully funded tuition fee and accommodation
06/10/23, 7:05 pm - +91 82875 72068: Actually you are mistaken over here, Let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now A lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
06/10/23, 7:08 pm - +263 77 590 5556: Oh thank you for the clarification
06/10/23, 7:08 pm - +263 77 590 5556: So what kind of scholarships do the institute offer
06/10/23, 7:16 pm - +91 82875 72068: Not to worry, Walentine, I will brief you regarding every piece of information as the session progresses.
06/10/23, 7:16 pm - +91 82875 72068: I have made you the group admin. Can you please add your parents to the group and let me know so that we can commence with the session?
06/10/23, 7:47 pm - +91 82875 72068: Can you please introduce them to the group as well?

I have analyzed his endeavors and career inclinations. According to my expertise, this program will align perfectly with his magnificent vision:

*B.Tech. Mechanical*

*B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering* is a 4-year undergraduate course

First thing any engineering aspirant considers while choosing a branch in Engineering is placement aspect and the course very well caters to it. A few questions which arise when admissions to engineering colleges commence include the branch in demand, highest paid engineering graduates and others such.  Apart from this palcement criteria, there are some other parameters which should be considered while choosing a discipline like- what are the research opportunities, what is scope of career growth etc.

Do you want me to guide you about the course in depth?
09/10/23, 8:07 pm - +263 77 238 9926: Yes please Sir .
09/10/23, 8:17 pm - +91 82875 72068: B.Tech. Mechanical

*B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering* is a 4-year undergraduate course

First thing any engineering aspirant considers while choosing a branch in Engineering is placement aspect and the course very well caters to it. A few questions which arise when admissions to engineering colleges commence include the branch in demand, highest paid engineering graduates and others such.  Apart from this palcement criteria, there are some other parameters which should be considered while choosing a discipline like- what are the research opportunities, what is scope of career growth etc.

Mechanical Engineering is the evergreen branch of engineering. Market scenario and demand of engineering graduates change every year but the demand of mechanical engineering degree will never be obsolete. Mechanical engineering graduates can find placements in almost every sector, right from construction sector to steel industry and from automobile to software.

Following are the sub disciplines that are associated with mechanical engineering:

*Production Engineering*
*Industrial Engineering*
*Manufacturing Engineering*
*Automobile Engineering*
*Artificial Intelligence*

The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized sub disciplines are discussed in this section.

*Mechanics* 

Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of forces and their effect upon matter. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and plastic) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics include Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies Dynamics the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations). Mechanics of materials, the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces Kinematics, the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion. Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms. Continuum mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than discrete) Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine

*Mechatronics and Robotics*

Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics. It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems. In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.

Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).

Robots are used extensively in industrial engineering. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.

*Thermodynamics and Thermo-science*

Thermodynamics is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a system. Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy (enthalpy) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.

Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of heat transfer, thermofluids, and energy conversion. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design engines and power plants, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat exchangers, heat sinks, radiators, refrigeration, insulation, and others.

*Design and drafting*

Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.

Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist of spray coatings, surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.

Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

09/10/23, 9:09 pm - +91 82875 72068: Please let me know once you have read all the information, Ms. Nomalanga.
09/10/23, 9:20 pm - +263 77 238 9926: Yes I have read
09/10/23, 9:22 pm - +91 82875 72068: After reading all of these fascinating facts, I'm sure you're interested in sending Walentine to India for her higher studies!
09/10/23, 9:22 pm - +263 77 238 9926: Definitely yes
09/10/23, 9:23 pm - +91 82875 72068: I am delighted to hear that, Ms. Nomalanga! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
09/10/23, 9:26 pm - +263 77 238 9926: No am familiar but all I know is that sometimes only the fortunate can afford that level of education
09/10/23, 9:26 pm - +91 82875 72068: Not to worry, Ms. Nomalanga! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
09/10/23, 9:27 pm - +91 82875 72068: <Media omitted>
09/10/23, 9:27 pm - +91 82875 72068: However, If a student meets and exceeds our academic criteria with a high passing grade, he/she becomes eligible for an exclusive scholarship. With the exclusive Scholarship, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1600-$2300, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc.
09/10/23, 9:27 pm - +91 82875 72068: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
09/10/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 238 9926: Yes I think we can try as much as possible to make ends and sacrifice for my brother
09/10/23, 9:33 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, Ms. Nomalanga. Our support doesn't stop there! Edoofa also offers an innovative *Earn While You Learn Program*. This program allows you to further reduce your remaining fees by gaining practical work experience while studying. It not only eases the financial burden but also provides you with valuable skills and industry exposure, enhancing your employability and ensuring a well-rounded education.

With *Edoofa's* 90-100% Scholarship and the opportunity to earn while you learn, you can focus on your studies, explore your field of interest, and prepare for a successful career.

So do you want me to guide you about the *Earn while you learn* program in depth?
09/10/23, 9:34 pm - +263 77 238 9926: That would be great
09/10/23, 9:34 pm - +263 77 238 9926: Kindly guide me
09/10/23, 9:35 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, Ms. Nomalanga. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
09/10/23, 9:35 pm - +91 82875 72068: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
09/10/23, 9:35 pm - +91 82875 72068: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
09/10/23, 9:35 pm - +91 82875 72068: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics <This message was edited>
09/10/23, 9:35 pm - +91 82875 72068: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi <This message was edited>
09/10/23, 9:36 pm - +91 82875 72068: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for your brother?
09/10/23, 9:40 pm - +263 77 238 9926: Yes it will be beneficial to a greater extent because he gains the technical know how of engineering
09/10/23, 9:43 pm - +91 82875 72068: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2000 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $60-$90 a month
09/10/23, 9:44 pm - +91 82875 72068: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
09/10/23, 9:44 pm - +91 82875 72068: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2000, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1000 in the first semester and $1000 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
09/10/23, 9:44 pm - +91 82875 72068: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

09/10/23, 9:46 pm - +91 82875 72068: I hope you can now realize how Walentine can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on his family?
09/10/23, 9:50 pm - +263 77 238 9926: Yes and I guess it's really a relief financially from what I am seeing
09/10/23, 9:50 pm - +91 82875 72068: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
09/10/23, 9:50 pm - +91 82875 72068: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
09/10/23, 9:50 pm - +91 82875 72068: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
09/10/23, 9:54 pm - +263 77 238 9926: I really appreciate point number 2 the most
09/10/23, 9:55 pm - +91 82875 72068: I understand that your emphasis is on employability. So may I know how you feel about Walentine studying abroad?
09/10/23, 9:58 pm - +263 77 238 9926: Well it gives me hope that he will have an opportunity to make his dreams come true and gain more experience
09/10/23, 9:59 pm - +91 82875 72068: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate his career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling him to independently support his family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for his family.
09/10/23, 10:00 pm - +91 82875 72068: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
09/10/23, 10:02 pm - +263 77 238 9926: Yes I believe so as well
09/10/23, 10:02 pm - +91 82875 72068: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
09/10/23, 10:02 pm - +91 82875 72068: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
09/10/23, 10:03 pm - +91 82875 72068: <Media omitted>
09/10/23, 10:03 pm - +91 82875 72068: This enrollment fee includes your

-*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
09/10/23, 10:03 pm - +263 77 238 9926: Can we kindly resume tomorrow it's now late
09/10/23, 10:05 pm - +91 82875 72068: <Media omitted>
09/10/23, 10:06 pm - +263 77 238 9926: Thank you
10/10/23, 9:02 am - +91 82875 72068: Good Morning,

*"The purpose of education is to replace an empty mind with an open one." – Malcolm Forbes*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
10/10/23, 6:04 pm - +91 82875 72068: Are we still connected? If you are facing any challenges, please do let me know.
10/10/23, 6:33 pm - +263 77 238 9926: Good day sir ,am sorry for the delay ..but am back on line .
10/10/23, 6:34 pm - +91 82875 72068: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Ms. Nomalanga!
10/10/23, 6:34 pm - +91 82875 72068: That is totally fine, Ms. Nomalanga.
10/10/23, 6:34 pm - +91 82875 72068: May I know whether you have comprehended the information, please?
10/10/23, 6:35 pm - +263 77 238 9926: Yes sir I have
10/10/23, 6:35 pm - +91 82875 72068: I am glad to hear that, Ms. Nomalanga!
10/10/23, 6:36 pm - +91 82875 72068: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
10/10/23, 6:36 pm - +91 82875 72068: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
10/10/23, 6:49 pm - +263 77 238 9926: Ok I understand sir
10/10/23, 6:50 pm - +91 82875 72068: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
10/10/23, 7:01 pm - +263 77 238 9926: I understand that the programme provides financial aid to the student as it covers part of the expenses such as tuition and accommodation.This greatly reduces the financial burden on us guardians and enables us to support the further studies of my brother
10/10/23, 7:05 pm - +91 82875 72068: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc! If you are found eligible for a higher quantum of scholarship, the cost of education will be reduced to $1600-$2300 per annum
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
10/10/23, 7:21 pm - +263 77 238 9926: Okay sir I understand everything
10/10/23, 7:22 pm - +91 82875 72068: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 7:23 pm - +263 77 238 9926: Well I think we are on stage one
10/10/23, 7:24 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, we are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
10/10/23, 7:25 pm - +263 77 238 9926: Yes sir go ahead
10/10/23, 7:26 pm - +91 82875 72068: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$750) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$750) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?

She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

11/10/23, 6:00 pm - +263 77 238 9926: Yes they are willing
11/10/23, 6:44 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
11/10/23, 7:36 pm - +263 77 590 5556: 1. I would like to study Mechanical engineering 

2. If possible I would like to study in India as it is one of the most recognised countries with an excellent engineering programme 

3. It ranges from $6000 to $8000 US dollars

4. The annual fee should range from $1600 to $ 2300 

5. The enrollment fee of the Edoofa program is $350

6. I will be given a period of 7 days to complete the first part of the enrollment fee

7. Yes
11/10/23, 8:03 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Are your parents ready for the same ?
11/10/23, 8:05 pm - +263 77 590 5556: My guardian agrees with this decision as she sees it as an opportunity to better myself
11/10/23, 8:42 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can she acknowledge the same in this group ?
11/10/23, 8:45 pm - +263 77 238 9926: Yes sir I agree
11/10/23, 9:48 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
11/10/23, 9:48 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
11/10/23, 9:48 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 9:48 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
11/10/23, 9:48 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 9:48 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 18th or 19th October 2023 for $200 and the 18th or 19th  of November for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 18th or 19th  of October 2023.

16/10/23, 5:42 pm - +263 77 590 5556: Yes sir
16/10/23, 5:51 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, Walentine. We have forwarded your results for evaluation, and we would like to inform you of a recent update in the evaluation process. We have received new guidelines from the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) regarding the prerequisites for pursuing Mechanical Engineering. According to these revised guidelines, the minimum academic criteria for pursuing a degree in Mechanical Engineering now include the successful completion of A-Level subjects, specifically Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics. Your understanding and compliance with these guidelines are greatly appreciated.
16/10/23, 5:56 pm - +91 82875 72068: If you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to reach out. We are here to assist you throughout this process!
16/10/23, 6:01 pm - +263 77 590 5556: I understand sir but is it possible to wait for my A level zimsec results to be out before changing courses
16/10/23, 6:19 pm - +91 82875 72068: May I know whether there is any specific reason for that, please?
16/10/23, 6:25 pm - +263 77 590 5556: I am positive that I can produce good results which may convince AICTE that mechanical engineering is the right course for me.
16/10/23, 6:27 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, Walentine. Ms. Nomalanga provided me with a thorough and insightful briefing on your career aspirations, for which I am grateful. I would be delighted to hear more about what specifically draws you to Mechanical Engineering. Please feel free to share all the intricate details of your passion and interest in this field. Your perspective is invaluable, and I'm eager to gain a deeper understanding of your motivations.
16/10/23, 6:44 pm - +263 77 590 5556: This passion for mechanical engineering developed from my love for gadgets and how they were made. Ever since I was a kid I used to break down appliances such as DvDs, broken phones and old televisions and then pretend to fix them up again. This passion was further deepened when I watched Sci fi shows, even though they were fictional they made me dream of designing and creating gadgets that will be of help in society and Improve the living standards of people.
16/10/23, 6:48 pm - +91 82875 72068: That sounds quite intriguing, Walentine! Could you kindly shed some light on  which science fiction shows have inspired your interest in this unique field, please?
16/10/23, 6:59 pm - +263 77 590 5556: There is this one South African show called chappie about a robot which developed a consciousness and also a way to transfer human consciousness to a robotic body. Even though some of the things may be just fictional, the concept of creating such machines and being part of the history being made by the technological advancements inspired me to pursue mechanical engineering
16/10/23, 7:01 pm - +91 82875 72068: I must commend your excellent taste in media, Walentine! I'm pleased to inform you that one of the actors in the movie, *Dev Patel*, has Indian heritage!

21/10/23, 7:27 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay
23/10/23, 10:58 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
23/10/23, 7:30 pm - Sahil Edoofa: @263775905556 @263772389926
23/10/23, 7:33 pm - +263 77 590 5556: Evening
23/10/23, 7:34 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did you manage to discuss it ?
23/10/23, 7:34 pm - +263 77 590 5556: Yes
23/10/23, 7:50 pm - Sahil Edoofa: any updates
23/10/23, 8:09 pm - +263 77 590 5556: They plan on paying tomorrow
23/10/23, 8:11 pm - +263 77 590 5556: Can you kindly share the banking details
23/10/23, 8:24 pm - Sahil Edoofa: basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
