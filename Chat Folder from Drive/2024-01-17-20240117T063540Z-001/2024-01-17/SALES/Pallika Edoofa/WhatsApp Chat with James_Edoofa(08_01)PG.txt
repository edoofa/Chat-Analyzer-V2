*"With a dream, comes the potential for achievement."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
10/01/24, 9:14 am - +263 78 106 9879: Yes
10/01/24, 9:28 am - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing today?
10/01/24, 9:28 am - +263 78 106 9879: Super sir
10/01/24, 9:29 am - +263 78 106 9879: What about this sir
10/01/24, 9:38 am - Pallika Edoofa: I will be guiding you regarding the same.
10/01/24, 9:40 am - Pallika Edoofa: Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
10/01/24, 9:56 am - +263 78 106 9879: Ok sir noted
10/01/24, 10:03 am - Pallika Edoofa: Proceeding further,  I would like to know what specific plans and preparations you and your parents have made for your tertiary education abroad?
10/01/24, 7:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 9:04 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good Morning,

*“If there is no struggle, there is no progress.” —Frederick Douglass*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
11/01/24, 9:16 am - +263 78 106 9879: A smile is a great way to start off your day sir. Morning.
11/01/24, 9:23 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's true!
11/01/24, 9:24 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that you are doing well

11/01/24, 9:50 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

11/01/24, 9:52 am - +263 78 106 9879: Yaaah they will manage sir

16/01/24, 9:48 am - +263 78 106 9879: Ok sir
16/01/24, 9:48 am - Pallika Edoofa: please note that we currently have a high volume of applicants participating in one-on-one counseling sessions, and there is a queue of individuals awaiting their turn.

16/01/24, 9:48 am - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sending,
As your evaluation progresses, I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
16/01/24, 9:50 am - +263 78 106 9879: Noo i did not apply anyware
16/01/24, 10:13 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/01/24, 11:48 am - +263 78 106 9879: Ok
16/01/24, 11:50 am - Pallika Edoofa: James, I would like to know that if you were interested in the engineering so why haven't you opted for Physics or Chemistry in your A level?
16/01/24, 11:52 am - +263 78 106 9879: I do physics in A level but i didn't regester it due to the shortage of money i.e it was not affordable sir but i can do it
16/01/24, 11:54 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, I understand!
16/01/24, 11:54 am - Pallika Edoofa: Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
16/01/24, 12:17 pm - +263 78 106 9879: So this means i can't do engineering  sir
16/01/24, 12:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: James, as per your subject combination are not able to pursue that, May I know your alternate career aspirations, please?
16/01/24, 12:21 pm - +263 78 106 9879: Sir Geography is a science subject... So i can't do mining engineering
16/01/24, 12:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: James, Please note that Geograpghy is a Social science subject and so, let me know alternate aspirations
16/01/24, 12:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 02:00 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule.
