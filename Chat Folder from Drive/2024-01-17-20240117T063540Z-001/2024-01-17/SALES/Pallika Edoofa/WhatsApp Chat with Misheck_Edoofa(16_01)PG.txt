16/01/24, 2:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Thompson, As you know, higher education is a big decision that can create a significant impact on your child’s future

As a parent, what are your financial plans and preparations for it so that your child receives access to the best opportunities?
16/01/24, 2:20 pm - +27 84 797 8620: thank you as things are not flowing well on my side i ask you to consider my child on 100perc scholarship help but i will try my best to put my hand on other small things financially
16/01/24, 2:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Thompson, 
Please note that Edoofa is a partially funded scholarship program! 

The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extracurricular Activities

So the universities will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of the scholarship
16/01/24, 2:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

Will you be able to manage the remaining expenses?
16/01/24, 2:25 pm - +27 84 797 8620: ok thank you I I will work hard to cover the needs
16/01/24, 2:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!
