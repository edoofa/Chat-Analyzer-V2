12/01/24, 12:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
12/01/24, 12:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country.

12/01/24, 12:24 pm - +263 78 549 9992: Yeah, I am confident, l am going to achieve it
12/01/24, 12:30 pm - +263 78 549 9992: I did some research of local universities and l also went for Career guidance. After that research l decided to continue looking forward for better opportunities abroad and then l found something about Edoofa Scholarship program. From there, l have not do any further research about universities abroad
12/01/24, 12:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's great!!
12/01/24, 12:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 12:44 pm - +263 78 549 9992: I didn't apply to any university yet, l'm waiting for my results to come out first.

12/01/24, 12:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Absire
