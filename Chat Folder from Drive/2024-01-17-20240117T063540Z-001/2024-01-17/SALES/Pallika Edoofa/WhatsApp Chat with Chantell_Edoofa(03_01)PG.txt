12/01/24, 9:27 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings to you all,
As scheduled, I am here to begin your sessions for the Edoofa Scholarship Program and evaluate your application.

Are you ready to begin?
12/01/24, 9:32 am - +263 78 319 4344: go morning, I'm ready
12/01/24, 9:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: So, Chantell, Continuing the discussion, Are you parents willing to support you financially?
12/01/24, 10:24 am - +263 78 319 4344: yes they are willing
12/01/24, 10:46 am - Pallika Edoofa: Great!
12/01/24, 10:47 am - Pallika Edoofa: Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

Will they be able to manage the remaining expenses?
12/01/24, 10:56 am - +263 78 319 4344: ok
12/01/24, 10:57 am - +263 78 319 4344: noted

12/01/24, 11:27 am - +263 78 319 4344: O level results are not not yet published
12/01/24, 11:38 am - Pallika Edoofa: In that case you can share the grades.
12/01/24, 1:55 pm - +263 78 319 4344: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 1:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
12/01/24, 2:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
12/01/24, 2:03 pm - +263 78 319 4344: yes I am very confident
12/01/24, 2:04 pm - +263 78 319 4344: I've only applied at Edoofa
12/01/24, 2:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 2:20 pm - +263 78 319 4344: I have went through the document
12/01/24, 2:20 pm - +263 78 319 4344: I understood
12/01/24, 2:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please can you share the term results of A level as well.
12/01/24, 2:29 pm - +263 78 319 4344: I'm not yet an A level student I'm still waiting for my O level resalt
12/01/24, 2:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: May I know when will your A level will end?
12/01/24, 2:31 pm - +263 78 319 4344: 2025
12/01/24, 2:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Certainly, would you prefer to undertake A levels initially and subsequently continue with us, or are you inclined towards pursuing a diploma course here?
12/01/24, 2:40 pm - +263 78 319 4344: yes I will continue with you

16/01/24, 9:20 am - Pallika Edoofa: Continuing the discussion, That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
16/01/24, 9:20 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/01/24, 10:03 am - +263 78 319 4344: So the reduced cost will be ranging from $2000-$3000 per semester?
16/01/24, 10:15 am - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, It will be ranging from this.
16/01/24, 10:18 am - +263 78 319 4344: ok
16/01/24, 10:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: *So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
16/01/24, 10:28 am - +263 78 319 4344: yes I do
16/01/24, 10:29 am - +263 78 319 4344: so my family will be paying $2000-$3000 per semester?
16/01/24, 10:32 am - Pallika Edoofa: Chantell, please go through that paragraph, the cost of education ranges from $2000-$3000 per annum.
16/01/24, 10:33 am - +263 78 319 4344: ok
16/01/24, 10:34 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
16/01/24, 10:40 am - +263 78 319 4344: no I do not know how its done please explain
16/01/24, 10:40 am - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
16/01/24, 10:40 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs

TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

16/01/24, 10:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
