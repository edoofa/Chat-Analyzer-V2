13/01/24, 12:03 pm - +263 78 090 4519: It is going to end this year and am doing Maths Biology and Crop science
13/01/24, 12:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
13/01/24, 12:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
13/01/24, 12:10 pm - +263 78 090 4519: I am sure l will pass and attain higher grades
13/01/24, 12:11 pm - +263 78 090 4519: Thank you
13/01/24, 12:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I was asking a question!
13/01/24, 12:13 pm - +263 78 090 4519: Ok the university im is from Africa  and it  is called African Leadership University
13/01/24, 12:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: May I know if you are pursuing a course right now!
13/01/24, 12:16 pm - +263 78 090 4519: Am not pursuing any course

15/01/24, 1:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greeting Everyone,
How are you doing today?

Kindly excuse the delay as I was occupied in the overwhelming number of applicants after the A-level results in Zimbabwe and their evaluation, 

So, Shall we begin with the session?
15/01/24, 1:31 pm - +263 77 385 1629: Yes we can
15/01/24, 1:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great!
15/01/24, 1:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that you have gone through our previous conversation, Mr. Sithole!
15/01/24, 1:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Continuing the session, I would like to know if Daniel was interested in the Medical field so, why he hasn't pursued Physics or Chemistry at A level?
15/01/24, 1:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
15/01/24, 1:51 pm - +263 77 385 1629: His o level results didnt allow him to take those subject  thats why he took Biology
15/01/24, 1:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!! I understand that!
15/01/24, 1:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since he does not have Biology, I regret to inform you that he is not eligible for Medicine and Pharmacy, but considering his interest there are better courses from the Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help fulfill his dreams of working in this field

*B.Sc. in Medical Laboratory Technology*

*Bachelor of Pharmacy(B.Pharm.)*

*BTech in Biomedical Engineering*

*B.Sc. in Nutrition and Dietetics*

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
15/01/24, 8:10 pm - +263 78 090 4519: I would be lying if l say yes l really don't have any clue
15/01/24, 8:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
15/01/24, 8:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 8:18 pm - +263 78 090 4519: Yes feel it's affordable for my family but l have a question
15/01/24, 8:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
15/01/24, 8:21 pm - +263 78 090 4519: Ok so my parents will not  cater more on my tuition fees but l will be taking care of it myself
15/01/24, 8:22 pm - +263 78 090 4519: Do by any chance anyone can get a fully funded scholarship
15/01/24, 8:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please note that Edoofa is a partially funded scholarship program! 

The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extracurricular Activities

So the universities will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of the scholarship
15/01/24, 8:24 pm - +263 78 090 4519: Ok ok now l know how to get there thank you siry
15/01/24, 8:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/01/24, 9:12 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Everyone, 
How are you all doing today?

Shall we begin our session?
16/01/24, 5:51 pm - +263 78 090 4519: Heyy
