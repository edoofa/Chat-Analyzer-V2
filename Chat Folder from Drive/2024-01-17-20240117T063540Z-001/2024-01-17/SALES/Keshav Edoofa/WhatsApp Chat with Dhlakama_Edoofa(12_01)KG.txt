13/01/24, 10:03 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Good Morning Kundai
13/01/24, 10:04 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: *I am Mr. Piyush, The Head of Admission at Edoofa.* 

I have been evaluating your responses in the counseling session with your counselor.

There was an emergency because of which Mr Keshav is a bit occupied
13/01/24, 10:05 am - +263 77 474 1322: That's okay. May you please inform me whenever he is free
13/01/24, 10:13 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Kundai, shall we proceed ahead as of now?
13/01/24, 10:14 am - +263 77 474 1322: Yes we may Sir
13/01/24, 10:16 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: So Kundai, tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Proud?
13/01/24, 10:26 am - +263 77 474 1322: I learnt that edoofa is committed to providing a  educational experience. Through this educational experience it prepares students to successful future as it encourages various projects. I also learnt that that through edoofa there's education whilst you learn which prepares students to be employed
13/01/24, 10:27 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: That is true Kundai, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
13/01/24, 10:27 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: <Media omitted>
13/01/24, 10:31 am - +263 77 474 1322: Ok please go on
13/01/24, 10:32 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
13/01/24, 10:33 am - +263 77 474 1322: Yes ,that is true <This message was edited>
13/01/24, 10:44 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Okay so Kundai, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
13/01/24, 10:45 am - +263 77 474 1322: Yes
13/01/24, 10:48 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Alright so Kundai, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
13/01/24, 10:56 am - +263 77 474 1322: <Media omitted>
13/01/24, 10:57 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Kundai, while I would be listening to the voicenote, is it possible for you to please answer the question in a text format since I am currently evaluating other student's applications as well it might be a bit challenging for me to evaluate the same through voicenotes.
13/01/24, 10:57 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: I am sorry to know about your father Kundai!
13/01/24, 10:59 am - +263 77 474 1322: So do you really want me resend the type message or it ok

13/01/24, 11:01 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: If I may ask, what motivates you regarding studying a course in humanities?
13/01/24, 11:05 am - +263 77 474 1322: What motivates me in studying the humanities is because they study things like culture, society, and human behavior. Learning about these topics can help me understand the world and the people who live in it, which in turn helps me be a better conversationalist and more helpful to the people I chat with.
13/01/24, 11:09 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: That is quite interesting, may I know from your family if anyone has pursued a career in arts before the same?

Also i would get thehe opportunity to experience a different culture, learn a new language, gain new perspectives, and develop your independence. <This message was edited>
15/01/24, 9:56 am - Keshav Edoofa: Since you are aware that through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years?
15/01/24, 9:59 am - +263 77 474 1322: Yes tell me more about that
15/01/24, 9:59 am - Keshav Edoofa: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

15/01/24, 10:12 am - Keshav Edoofa: Great Dhlakama!
15/01/24, 10:12 am - Keshav Edoofa: So now, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. 

Moving ahead,  by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
15/01/24, 10:16 am - +263 77 474 1322: I heard someone saying it's around 10 000usd per semester covering everything like accommodation <This message was edited>
15/01/24, 10:23 am - Keshav Edoofa: Well I will guide you with the correct information Dhlakama!
15/01/24, 10:23 am - Keshav Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
15/01/24, 10:24 am - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
15/01/24, 10:24 am - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
15/01/24, 10:24 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 10:24 am - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
15/01/24, 10:32 am - +263 77 474 1322: Understood please continue
15/01/24, 10:33 am - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words Dhlakama what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
15/01/24, 10:34 am - Keshav Edoofa: Do you have anything to ask? or So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
15/01/24, 10:36 am - +263 77 474 1322: So far everything is clear we may proceed
15/01/24, 10:40 am - Keshav Edoofa: Kundai, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
15/01/24, 10:43 am - Keshav Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

15/01/24, 10:43 am - Keshav Edoofa: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion.

Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-

15/01/24, 10:43 am - Keshav Edoofa: *3. Webinars: -*

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
15/01/24, 11:17 am - +263 77 474 1322: It will benefit me because It allows students to earn money while they're studying, which can help to offset the costs of their education and reduce their financial burden. I think this program has the potential to benefit both students and the economy as a whole. It can also help students gain valuable work experience while they're still in school, and it can also help to fill labor gaps in the workforce.So overall it's beneficial
15/01/24, 11:19 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that Kundai, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
15/01/24, 11:28 am - +263 77 474 1322: Understood
15/01/24, 11:29 am - Keshav Edoofa: Good Kundai
15/01/24, 11:29 am - Keshav Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

15/01/24, 11:30 am - Keshav Edoofa: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
15/01/24, 11:40 am - +263 77 474 1322: That's what i was looking for ,it's a good and impressive programme
15/01/24, 11:51 am - Keshav Edoofa: In our quest to provide an education that is affordable, accessible and employable, our Founders have been to African Nations multiple times. Recently during their stay in Zimbabwe in June 2023, they gained valuable insights. Inflation has been a real challenge for Zimbabwean families from the last 20 years.

Until a few years ago, cost of tertiary education in Zimbabwe was affordable for majority of families, however with the recent collapse of the Zimbabwean Dollar, a lot of parents shared their experiences, emphasized the financial challenges of pursuing higher education. In today’s time *Tertiary education expenses in Zimbabwe can amount to approximately $2500-$3500 annually. This surely varies from course to course.*

While the cost of education rose by 25% and is within the range of $1200-$1500 per year, the cost of living is notably high. *Even a basic meal of Sadza and curry can cost a student $1 per serving. This means around $1100 is allocated solely for food, with additional essential costs such as internet which costs around $25-$35 a month, accommodation, and transportation pushing the total to $2000-$2500 per year.
15/01/24, 11:58 am - +263 77 474 1322: That's true ,this is the current situation we are facing here
15/01/24, 11:59 am - Keshav Edoofa: Kundai, by now I hope you must have understood that Edoofa Scholarship Program is not a place where students get an opportunity to be just admitted in an Internationally Recognized University, rather it is much more than that. While there are multiple differentiators, Edoofa’s offered value to a particular student is more that what any admission agent/consultant may provide.


They even encountered Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program in 2018-2019 but hadn't proceeded due to the lure of quick earnings within the country. However, this year, those student shared their hardships, with some holding prestigious degrees from institutions like UZ, MSU, and HIT, now working as petrol attendants or mobile/laptop repair technicians. Others faced even greater challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, it's evident that many of them regret not seizing the opportunity earlier. I as your counselor understand the harsh realities that are there in your home country. What are your thoughts regarding the same?
15/01/24, 12:14 pm - +263 77 474 1322: I think that when you get the opportunity to study you grab it  and use it wisely
15/01/24, 12:17 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since I will be getting up for my lunch break , we shall continue with session after sometime
We shall meet at 1:00 PM CAT
15/01/24, 12:34 pm - +263 77 474 1322: Noted Sir
15/01/24, 1:03 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Shall we continue with our session now?
15/01/24, 1:03 pm - +263 77 474 1322: Yes we may
15/01/24, 1:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Kundai, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
15/01/24, 1:08 pm - +263 77 474 1322: Yes sir
15/01/24, 1:11 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?

Also I hope Mrs. Sarah @263779804691 you are following up with the session you know because parents involvement is upmost important during the child's counseling session!

If you want to ask anything do freely.
15/01/24, 1:15 pm - +263 77 474 1322: Yes i have discussed with them and they see it as a good opportunity
15/01/24, 1:19 pm - Keshav Edoofa: That is wonderful Kundai!
15/01/24, 1:19 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.
15/01/24, 1:42 pm - +263 77 474 1322: Sorry network problems
15/01/24, 1:44 pm - +263 77 474 1322: Ok
15/01/24, 1:47 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Kundai as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?
15/01/24, 1:49 pm - +263 77 474 1322: About 1500 -2250
15/01/24, 1:51 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Kundai, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
15/01/24, 1:51 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 1:51 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
15/01/24, 2:09 pm - +263 77 474 1322: Ok understood
15/01/24, 2:11 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
15/01/24, 2:31 pm - +263 77 474 1322: That is true
15/01/24, 2:31 pm - +263 77 980 4691: OK understood Sir. Kundai s father is deceased and myself being the breadwinner left also suffered a stroke and trying hard to make ends meet l ll hv to find alternative ways to raise the funds
15/01/24, 2:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I can understand Mrs. Sarah the challenges and difficulties you have to face and i really admire the support you are providing to Kundai.
15/01/24, 2:35 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I also believe you want the best education abroad for your child and do not want this opportunity of securing a scholarship to go away am I right?
15/01/24, 2:35 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
15/01/24, 2:41 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
15/01/24, 3:12 pm - +263 77 980 4691: That's right
15/01/24, 3:14 pm - +263 77 980 4691: Very much understood
15/01/24, 3:14 pm - +263 77 474 1322: Okay
15/01/24, 3:28 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope I am clear with this and you have comprehended the same!
15/01/24, 3:29 pm - Keshav Edoofa: However Kundai and Mrs. Sarah, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
15/01/24, 4:05 pm - +263 77 474 1322: Noted
15/01/24, 4:07 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Kundai!
15/01/24, 4:09 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
15/01/24, 4:18 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:00 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
15/01/24, 4:32 pm - +263 77 474 1322: Ok noted
15/01/24, 4:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Kundai can you answer the question since we are about to complete your counselling session?
15/01/24, 6:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: This message was deleted
15/01/24, 6:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: This message was deleted
15/01/24, 6:47 pm - +263 77 474 1322: No m not familiar with it
16/01/24, 9:30 am - Keshav Edoofa: Good Morning Kundai
16/01/24, 9:30 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
16/01/24, 11:31 am - +263 77 474 1322: Good day sorry but I am having some network problems
16/01/24, 11:31 am - +263 77 474 1322: Yes we may
16/01/24, 12:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/01/24, 12:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Kundai, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
16/01/24, 12:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
16/01/24, 12:26 pm - +263 77 474 1322: Understood
16/01/24, 12:26 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
16/01/24, 12:26 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
16/01/24, 12:26 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
16/01/24, 12:27 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/01/24, 12:31 pm - +263 77 474 1322: Understood
16/01/24, 12:36 pm - Keshav Edoofa: As of now would your parents like to ask anything please?
16/01/24, 12:42 pm - +263 77 474 1322: Currently she's at work maybe at 10pm she will be available
16/01/24, 1:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check <This message was edited>
16/01/24, 1:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
