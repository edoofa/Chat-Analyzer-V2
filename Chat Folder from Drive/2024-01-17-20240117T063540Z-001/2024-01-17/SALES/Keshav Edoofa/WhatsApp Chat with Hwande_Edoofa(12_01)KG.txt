12/01/24, 1:56 pm - +263 78 843 1939: Okay
12/01/24, 1:58 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright, so Aleck I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Isheanesu, is that correct?
12/01/24, 2:00 pm - +263 78 843 1939: Yes, it is......he just briefed me about it
12/01/24, 2:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Very well then Aleck
12/01/24, 2:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: let me further elaborate about Edoofa program to you
12/01/24, 2:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
12/01/24, 2:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/01/24, 2:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
12/01/24, 2:02 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 2:07 pm - +263 78 843 1939: I've read through all the information........I've got it now
12/01/24, 2:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
12/01/24, 2:38 pm - +263 78 843 1939: Yes, of course......you're right about that
12/01/24, 2:39 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so Aleck, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
12/01/24, 2:44 pm - +263 78 843 1939: I'm very sure about Proactive Counselling Session
12/01/24, 2:45 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Amazing Aleck!,  I believe this is the spirit I look for in the students whom I counsel and I have seen that such students get the maximum scholarship in our Edoofa Scholarship Program
12/01/24, 2:51 pm - +263 78 843 1939: Okay
12/01/24, 2:55 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Right Aleck
12/01/24, 2:56 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so Aleck, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
12/01/24, 3:49 pm - +263 78 843 1939: To begin with, my full name is Aleck Hwande..........just finished my Advanced level. I wish to venture into Arts and law studies.

*Good Verbal Communication*– A lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding which are crucial for a successful career in law.
*Good Time Management*– In the legal profession, time management is very crucial. The art of delegating tasks, working within deadlines, and prioritizing tasks to achieve success is very essential.
*A great degree of self-confidence*– This profession needs a high degree of self-confidence to win the clients’ trust. A strong belief in yourself will go a long way in winning arguments and cases.

*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.
*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.

15/01/24, 1:07 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So now Aleck, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far
15/01/24, 2:17 pm - +263 78 843 1939: I've understood, I'm satisfied, I got no questions so far so good
15/01/24, 2:18 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Aleck
15/01/24, 2:18 pm - Keshav Edoofa: This message was deleted
15/01/24, 2:19 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Let me now brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
15/01/24, 2:19 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
15/01/24, 2:19 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
15/01/24, 2:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 2:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
15/01/24, 2:28 pm - +263 78 843 1939: I got it
15/01/24, 2:29 pm - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words Aleck what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
15/01/24, 2:30 pm - +263 78 843 1939: Okay, I get it
15/01/24, 2:32 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth? or you have something to ask?
15/01/24, 2:32 pm - +263 78 843 1939: You can go ahead with the briefing
15/01/24, 2:37 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
15/01/24, 2:37 pm - Keshav Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
15/01/24, 2:37 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
15/01/24, 2:37 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

15/01/24, 2:37 pm - Keshav Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
15/01/24, 2:43 pm - +263 78 843 1939: Yes, I think this is beneficial
15/01/24, 2:44 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that Aleck, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
15/01/24, 2:46 pm - +263 78 843 1939: Okay, Mr. Keshav I do understand
15/01/24, 2:48 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

15/01/24, 2:53 pm - Keshav Edoofa: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
15/01/24, 2:55 pm - +263 78 843 1939: So they earned monthly these amounts??
15/01/24, 2:56 pm - +263 78 843 1939: I think Edoofa is the way to go
15/01/24, 3:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Yes Aleck thats correct
15/01/24, 3:02 pm - Keshav Edoofa: In our quest to provide an education that is affordable, accessible and employable, our Founders have been to African Nations multiple times. Recently during their stay in Zimbabwe in June 2023, they gained valuable insights. Inflation has been a real challenge for Zimbabwean families from the last 20 years.

Until a few years ago, cost of tertiary education in Zimbabwe was affordable for majority of families, however with the recent collapse of the Zimbabwean Dollar, a lot of parents shared their experiences, emphasized the financial challenges of pursuing higher education. In today’s time *Tertiary education expenses in Zimbabwe can amount to approximately $2500-$3500 annually. This surely varies from course to course.*

While the cost of education rose by 25% and is within the range of $1200-$1500 per year, the cost of living is notably high. *Even a basic meal of Sadza and curry can cost a student $1 per serving. This means around $1100 is allocated solely for food, with additional essential costs such as internet which costs around $25-$35 a month, accommodation, and transportation pushing the total to $2000-$2500 per year.
15/01/24, 3:04 pm - +263 78 843 1939: Mmmmmm it's quite a good program
15/01/24, 3:05 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you must have understood that Edoofa Scholarship Program is not a place where students get an opportunity to be just admitted in an Internationally Recognized University, rather it is much more than that. While there are multiple differentiators, Edoofa’s offered value to a particular student is more that what any admission agent/consultant may provide.


They even encountered Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program in 2018-2019 but hadn't proceeded due to the lure of quick earnings within the country. However, this year, those student shared their hardships, with some holding prestigious degrees from institutions like UZ, MSU, and HIT, now working as petrol attendants or mobile/laptop repair technicians. Others faced even greater challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.
Observing this scenario, it's evident that many of them regret not seizing the opportunity earlier. I as your counselor understand the harsh realities that are there in your home country. What are your thoughts regarding the same Aleck?
15/01/24, 3:07 pm - +263 78 843 1939: It's not going well this side Sir
15/01/24, 3:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I understand Aleck , therefore Edoofa plays its part in helping such students
15/01/24, 3:10 pm - +263 78 843 1939: You're doing very well Sir by doing so to help each and everyone else here
15/01/24, 3:12 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
15/01/24, 3:18 pm - +263 78 843 1939: Yes
15/01/24, 3:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Aleck as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
15/01/24, 4:21 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:00 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
15/01/24, 4:52 pm - +263 78 843 1939: *$1500-$2250*
15/01/24, 4:54 pm - Keshav Edoofa: @263788431939 would it be possible for you to be active for the next 05-10 minutes since we are about to complete the entire counselling session?
15/01/24, 5:10 pm - +263 78 843 1939: Yes Sir
15/01/24, 6:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Aleck!
15/01/24, 6:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
15/01/24, 6:15 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 6:15 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
15/01/24, 9:38 pm - +263 78 843 1939: Okay, that's good
16/01/24, 9:21 am - Keshav Edoofa: Good Morning Aleck
16/01/24, 9:22 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
16/01/24, 9:53 am - +263 78 843 1939: Please resend your messages
16/01/24, 9:57 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Godo Morning Aleck
16/01/24, 9:57 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: I hope you are doing well please?
16/01/24, 9:59 am - +263 78 843 1939: I'm doing just fine, how're you doing??
16/01/24, 10:01 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: I am doing well Aleck
16/01/24, 10:01 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Mr Keshav's device has some challenges, as of now shall we proceed ahead?
16/01/24, 10:04 am - +263 78 843 1939: Yes, of course
16/01/24, 10:23 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Did you understand the same please?
16/01/24, 10:24 am - +263 78 843 1939: Yes, I did
16/01/24, 10:58 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
16/01/24, 12:04 pm - +263 78 843 1939: Yes, I do
16/01/24, 12:13 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
16/01/24, 12:13 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: However Aleck, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
16/01/24, 12:22 pm - +263 78 843 1939: Okay, that's fine
16/01/24, 12:22 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
16/01/24, 12:39 pm - +263 78 843 1939: No
16/01/24, 12:58 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: <Media omitted>
16/01/24, 12:58 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Right now Aleck, we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
16/01/24, 12:58 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
16/01/24, 1:01 pm - +263 78 843 1939: Yes, I did
16/01/24, 1:01 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
16/01/24, 1:01 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
16/01/24, 1:01 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
16/01/24, 1:01 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: <Media omitted>
16/01/24, 1:03 pm - +263 78 843 1939: Okay
16/01/24, 1:09 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: What else would you like to ask @263788431939?
