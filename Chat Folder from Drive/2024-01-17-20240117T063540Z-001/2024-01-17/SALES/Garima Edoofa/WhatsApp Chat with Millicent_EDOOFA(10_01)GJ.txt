I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible and employment-oriented higher education program.

I will be waiting for your response.
