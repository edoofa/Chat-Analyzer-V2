06/01/24, 1:31 pm - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hardwork for your community Kudzaishe, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you.

06/01/24, 2:24 pm - +263 78 319 4070: I have understood everything properly and l'm starting to love lndia even more
06/01/24, 2:28 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay well Kudzaishe, since you have understood all the reasons properly as well, can you now tell me:-

1)How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career?

2)How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
06/01/24, 2:37 pm - +263 78 319 4070: Studying in lndia would flower my career because lndian degrees are recognised world wide , there for l would have room to work in any country on this planet , moreover,  education in lndia offer practical lessons as well as theory lessons,  this gives students a base to put the their skills not only in books but in reality....therefore,  studying  in lndia is guaranteeing yourself a great and brighter future
06/01/24, 2:38 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is remarkable, Kudzaishe. I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing the education, the student is capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
06/01/24, 2:42 pm - +263 78 319 4070: Yes sir we are very much aware of the expenses of international students without scholarships in lndia that's why we believe that Edoofa was sent by God to do the great work
06/01/24, 2:44 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me help you understand it in a better way.
06/01/24, 2:45 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.

Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
06/01/24, 2:45 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/01/24, 2:45 pm - Garima Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:


*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
06/01/24, 2:46 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, don't you think it is affordable for your family?
06/01/24, 2:49 pm - +263 78 319 4070: I think it is affordable sir...my family can manage
06/01/24, 2:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: In simple words Kudzaishe what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*


*Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?*
06/01/24, 2:51 pm - +263 78 319 4070: Yes sir tell me more about the Earn While You Learn Program
06/01/24, 2:55 pm - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
06/01/24, 2:55 pm - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.


1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
06/01/24, 2:55 pm - Garima Edoofa: 2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
06/01/24, 2:55 pm - Garima Edoofa: 3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
06/01/24, 2:55 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/01/24, 2:55 pm - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
06/01/24, 3:06 pm - +263 78 319 4070: My question is do you cover the 100 % of the tuition fees with the EWYL programme and what about your study time since this seems like an all day job
06/01/24, 4:21 pm - Garima Edoofa: let me help you understand as you might be aware, that the Edoofa scholarship program offers *50% to 100%* scholarships on the tuition fees. However, to get such a high quantum of scholarship the university has some criteria that the student should have extremely great merits in their A, and O Levels, co-curricular actives, and Edoofa's recommendation too. The EWYL Program helps students to learn and earn and further reduce their costs by earning credits. Along with that, I would like to add that EWYL is not a full-time job, please instead it will help in the overall development of the student and later it will make the student job ready for the future.

I hope we are clear here?
06/01/24, 4:41 pm - +263 78 319 4070: We are now crystal clear ...thank you for the explanation
06/01/24, 4:46 pm - Garima Edoofa: I really appreciate that.
06/01/24, 4:46 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
06/01/24, 4:46 pm - Garima Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

06/01/24, 5:30 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
1.*Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.*Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.*Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.*Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
06/01/24, 5:30 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
06/01/24, 5:48 pm - +263 78 319 4070: I have appreciated the EWYL programe the most because it includes your fact no.2 and it makes the tuition fees less expensive
06/01/24, 5:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright Kudzaishe, basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
06/01/24, 5:56 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for Monday at 10 AM CAT as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation*
06/01/24, 5:57 pm - +263 78 319 4070: Yes l'm ready
06/01/24, 5:57 pm - +263 78 319 4070: No sir my network is a little bit slow today
06/01/24, 5:58 pm - Garima Edoofa: Kudzaishe as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
06/01/24, 6:02 pm - +263 78 319 4070: Okay and how do you apply moreover how do you know the best universities to apply to
06/01/24, 6:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you on *Monday again at 10:00 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

Have a good night
God Bless You!
06/01/24, 6:05 pm - +263 78 319 4070: Okay thank you...enjoy the rest of your day
08/01/24, 9:59 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263783194070 @263775570205 , Hope you are doing well.
08/01/24, 9:59 am - Garima Edoofa: I am here to continue with your session, shall we start?
08/01/24, 10:00 am - +263 78 319 4070: Good morning to you too sir ...sure we can start
08/01/24, 10:02 am - Garima Edoofa: Can you please answer this question?
08/01/24, 10:06 am - +263 78 319 4070: A student would end up spending $2 250
08/01/24, 10:06 am - +263 78 319 4070: May you please answer this question
08/01/24, 10:15 am - Garima Edoofa: As we have collaborated with 250+ universities, it's important to note that each application is unique. The list of universities that your application qualifies for will be provided at a later stage in the process, given that we are currently in the midst of our counseling session.
08/01/24, 10:19 am - +263 78 319 4070: Okay
08/01/24, 11:22 am - +263 78 319 4070: I have decided my future and what l really want....if you have more questions l am free to answer...l would like to tell you that we opening schools tomorrow which marks the beginning of my final year there for l might not be available for our session at 10 A.M as l will be at xul ....l will try to show up but if l'm unreachable then l will be busy with school work ...l hope you understand
08/01/24, 12:25 pm - Garima Edoofa: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
08/01/24, 12:25 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 12:25 pm - Garima Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
08/01/24, 12:25 pm - Garima Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.

Don’t you think so?
08/01/24, 12:27 pm - Garima Edoofa: I understand, In that case, may I know what time is suitable for you to attend the session?
08/01/24, 12:31 pm - +263 78 319 4070: I fully understand sir ...Edoofa is one of a kind
08/01/24, 12:31 pm - +263 78 319 4070: I will be available  after 15:30 pm
08/01/24, 12:33 pm - +263 78 319 4070: Or maybe throughout the day but responding late to the messages as l will be dedicating most of my time to school work
08/01/24, 12:50 pm - Garima Edoofa: I understand, please.
08/01/24, 12:51 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
08/01/24, 12:51 pm - Garima Edoofa: Kudzaishe basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
08/01/24, 12:51 pm - Garima Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
08/01/24, 1:01 pm - +263 78 319 4070: I have understood the requirements and thank you for the vivid explanation...we can proceed
08/01/24, 1:03 pm - Garima Edoofa: Kudzaishe, as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspect of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his finances all by himself (in 80 to 100 words)?
08/01/24, 1:26 pm - +263 78 319 4070: Edoofa reduced to application fees from spending $2 250 applying to various universities to spending just $350 because they believe that parents cannot raise thousands , it is too expensive...moreover it went on to move from demanding the whole $350 in just 7 days to allowing parents to just pay $200 in 7 days and finish the rest in 30 days ....by doing this,  Edoofa is trying to create a big hand which fits every African student with great dreams. When a student is finished with securing a place in the Edoofa's basket then he/she can start EWYL programme which will be contributing to the annual tuition fee of your first year . This will reduce the burden from parents since they would have had faced other expenses for student to reach his destination where he will be going to pursue his dreams after passing A level of course.  However if the student unfortunately fails A level and does not meet the standards required , then the $350 of the programe fee will be refunded to parents
08/01/24, 1:42 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you
*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications,SOP,Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions etc all you need to pay is $350
 
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee,Accommodation,Food,Wifi,Laundry,Library,Gym fee etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
08/01/24, 1:46 pm - +263 78 319 4070: Okay l understand
08/01/24, 1:53 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes Kudzaishe and I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
08/01/24, 1:56 pm - +263 78 319 4070: Yes l have fully understood how the Earn While you Learn Programe further reduces the tuition fees
08/01/24, 2:00 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes, indeed.
08/01/24, 2:01 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 2:01 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
08/01/24, 2:01 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
08/01/24, 2:01 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
08/01/24, 2:04 pm - +263 78 319 4070: Yes sir the picture and the explanations have made it all clear now
08/01/24, 2:05 pm - Garima Edoofa: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that 
particular University chosen by you.
08/01/24, 2:05 pm - Garima Edoofa: Basically, this registration fee of ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments*. The first part will be paid in Coming few months of (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).

*After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

08/01/24, 2:32 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes, please I really appreciate that.
08/01/24, 2:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
08/01/24, 2:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: Mrs.Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

08/01/24, 2:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*
