I am under the commercial department doing Economics, Business Studies and Geography. I would really like to study marketing after I am done with my A level. I am very good grasping and understanding anything new. I am also good at business studies which is very much ny favorite subject. I am very good at interacting with people and I am a good listener. However I am very much fragile as I can't stand harsh behavior and talks. My other weakness is that I have trust issues from time to time.Tennis is one of my favorite things to do and playing chess to. I also make reading regularly a habit to make sure that i grasp what I don't know nor understand. My mother is self employed and I come from a family of three where I am now the only child living with my mother in Pumula North

10/01/24, 10:49 am - Harmehak: I am very sorry for the loss, Simelinkosi.
10/01/24, 10:49 am - +263 78 835 2122: -thank you ma'am
10/01/24, 10:51 am - Harmehak: I appreciate your sister's efforts to quit job and own a business to be able to have a desired life, Simelinkosi.

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
10/01/24, 11:03 am - +263 78 835 2122: -yes i believe so as i get to learn new cultures and have new experiences... I also get to meet different people and learn different languages and how to speak them. This makes one open-minded to different practices done by different people so I do believe that it's life changing
10/01/24, 11:05 am - Harmehak: Well put across,

So would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
10/01/24, 11:06 am - +263 78 835 2122: -yes I've always wanted to learn from abroad and I believe I am
10/01/24, 11:07 am - Harmehak: Simelinkosi, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

10/01/24, 11:10 am - Harmehak: That's great,

I greatly appreciate your mother's support.
10/01/24, 11:10 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
10/01/24, 11:11 am - +263 78 835 2122: -i am confident ma'am and I always have and always will
10/01/24, 11:11 am - +263 78 835 2122: -noted
10/01/24, 11:12 am - Harmehak: That's great
10/01/24, 11:12 am - +263 78 835 2122: -last year I was the top archiver in the commercials department and I am going to maintain that
10/01/24, 11:13 am - Harmehak: Simelinkosi, are you aware that we have students who would be coming to India and are in India from both Embakwe high and Plumtree high from Plumtree town?

Both the schools are associated with Edoofa.
10/01/24, 11:13 am - Harmehak: That's wonderful, Simelinkosi.
10/01/24, 11:14 am - +263 78 835 2122: -i didn't know
10/01/24, 11:15 am - +263 78 835 2122: -are they in a

11/01/24, 9:32 am - Harmehak: You see, Simelinkosi, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
11/01/24, 9:34 am - +263 78 835 2122: -i understand
11/01/24, 9:35 am - Harmehak: Having shared the same, I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future, Simelinkosi.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
11/01/24, 9:46 am - +263 78 835 2122: -currently there hasn't been electricity for the past two days but what i know is that India has a diversity of cultures and practices and everyone is welcome to learn more about them.i also know that the education system is the best...it effectively imparts the leaners with the right knowledge and skills needed..it prepares them for future challenges and job opportunities
11/01/24, 9:47 am - Harmehak: I do understand, and I am glad you have awareness.

11/01/24, 9:50 am - +263 78 835 2122: -i now know more about India thank you very much
11/01/24, 9:51 am - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
11/01/24, 9:55 am - +263 78 835 2122: -we know that it is expensive if one is doing everything by themselves without a scholarship
11/01/24, 9:56 am - Harmehak: Very correct!
11/01/24, 9:57 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
11/01/24, 9:57 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
11/01/24, 9:57 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
11/01/24, 9:57 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 9:59 am - +263 78 835 2122: -I understand ma'am
11/01/24, 9:59 am - +263 78 835 2122: -now it is affordable to anyone
11/01/24, 10:00 am - Harmehak: I appreciate
11/01/24, 10:00 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
11/01/24, 10:01 am - +263 78 835 2122: -it is a good idea as one will be gaining more knowledge and skills
11/01/24, 10:02 am - Harmehak: Very correct!
11/01/24, 10:02 am - Harmehak: Simelinkosi, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
11/01/24, 10:03 am - +263 78 835 2122: -yes its true
11/01/24, 10:04 am - +263 78 835 2122: -its costly to attend tertiary education in Zimbabwe as the prices are always fluctuating making hard to budget and plan ahead
11/01/24, 10:05 am - Harmehak: Indeed, Simelinkosi!

So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India?
11/01/24, 10:05 am - +263 78 835 2122: -yes ma'am
11/01/24, 10:06 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
11/01/24, 10:06 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
11/01/24, 10:06 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
11/01/24, 10:06 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

11/01/24, 10:10 am - +263 78 835 2122: -so the EWYL program is available in every department
11/01/24, 10:10 am - Harmehak: Yes please!

Every student in every department gets the opportunity to be a part of the Earn While You Learn Program.
11/01/24, 10:11 am - Harmehak: All the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake, Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways:

1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:- Having a head start that too of more than 20 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.

Giving you an example, Persistance Muza the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself. 

This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.

2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:- Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels. 

3,  Having the benefit of the Community:- This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.
11/01/24, 10:11 am - +263 78 835 2122: -understood ma'am
11/01/24, 10:12 am - Harmehak: Did you thoroughly go through the same?
11/01/24, 10:15 am - +263 78 835 2122: -understanding the program?
11/01/24, 10:17 am - Harmehak: Regarding how the Earn While You Learn Program would work for you as you would be proceeding for 2025 intake!
11/01/24, 10:17 am - Harmehak: I happened to explain three points here.
11/01/24, 10:18 am - +263 78 835 2122: -yes I understood
11/01/24, 10:20 am - Harmehak: That's great
11/01/24, 10:21 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

11/01/24, 10:26 am - Harmehak: I do understand please.

Mrs Nomusa, you can continue the discussion on her behalf.

We would conclude the discussion in the next 15-20 minutes.
11/01/24, 10:26 am - +263 77 484 6799: Oky mum
11/01/24, 10:26 am - Harmehak: I hope you have followed the discussion so far please?
11/01/24, 10:29 am - +263 77 484 6799: Yaaa mum but some questions are strictly for Simelinkosi. Me l can answer what belongs to as a parent
11/01/24, 10:32 am - Harmehak: I do understand please.

As of now do you have any questions for me?
11/01/24, 10:34 am - +263 77 484 6799: Are there any difficulties when processing the documents to come at your side
11/01/24, 10:36 am - Harmehak: Our visa and admissions team connect when the process would start for Simelinkosi.

So they assist you if you encounter any challenge, however the chances for the same are very low as you would be well informed about everything in advance!
11/01/24, 10:37 am - +263 77 484 6799: Oky mum l can understand that.
11/01/24, 10:48 am - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
11/01/24, 10:51 am - +263 77 484 6799: Oky mum
11/01/24, 10:53 am - +263 77 484 6799: Do the students work while is learning
11/01/24, 10:54 am - Harmehak: They work under Edoofa itself, in the Earn While You Learn Program.
11/01/24, 10:59 am - +263 77 484 6799: Oky mum l get you.
11/01/24, 11:00 am - +263 77 484 6799: So they could afford their pocket money
11/01/24, 11:00 am - Harmehak: This is for them to contribute in the studies meanwhile learn skills required for today's job world.
11/01/24, 11:01 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
11/01/24, 11:02 am - +263 77 484 6799: Oky mum l get you.
11/01/24, 11:03 am - Harmehak: Mrs Nomusa, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
11/01/24, 11:03 am - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
11/01/24, 11:05 am - +263 77 484 6799: Oky mum this will happen after the Alevel results are out
11/01/24, 11:06 am - Harmehak: This is for the students who apply by themselves without Edoofa, before or after A level results.
11/01/24, 11:07 am - +263 77 484 6799: So those with Edoofa applies for how much
11/01/24, 11:18 am - Harmehak: Would you agree that student would spend about $1500-2250 without Edoofa?
11/01/24, 11:23 am - +263 77 484 6799: No mum l wasn't aware of that
11/01/24, 11:23 am - Harmehak: I understand
11/01/24, 11:24 am - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
11/01/24, 11:24 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 11:24 am - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
11/01/24, 11:26 am - +263 77 484 6799: Oky mum l understand everything thing
11/01/24, 11:26 am - Harmehak: You see Mrs Nomusa, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
11/01/24, 11:29 am - +263 77 484 6799: Oky so everything will be included in$ $2000 to $3000
11/01/24, 11:31 am - Harmehak: $2000-3000 is for the Tuition fee, Accomodation, Food along with the Basic university expenses.
11/01/24, 11:36 am - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
11/01/24, 11:36 am - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
11/01/24, 12:03 pm - +263 77 484 6799: Oky mum l get you all what you are saying
11/01/24, 12:08 pm - +263 77 484 6799: Oky mum l understand unlike here in Zimbabwe we are suffering so every thing need to be done in time so that can complete to pay all the required finances in tine
11/01/24, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please.
11/01/24, 12:09 pm - +263 77 484 6799: I really apreciate  everything you are saying
11/01/24, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.

11/01/24, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
11/01/24, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

13/01/24, 10:30 am - Harmehak: Have you and Mrs Nomusa already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? 

You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
13/01/24, 10:34 am - +263 78 835 2122: -so she managed on her own

13/01/24, 10:45 am - Harmehak: So far, do you have any queries for me, Simelinkosi?
13/01/24, 10:45 am - +263 78 835 2122: -not really ma'am
13/01/24, 10:46 am - +263 78 835 2122: -i just want to ask how long these sessions take because sometimes the time you arrange clashes with my school work
13/01/24, 10:48 am - Harmehak: I do understand please.

Now we will proceed ahead with Stage 2.

Counseling session takes time only.
13/01/24, 11:03 am - +263 78 835 2122: -okay ma'am
13/01/24, 11:07 am - Harmehak: Would you like to ask anything else?
13/01/24, 11:10 am - +263 78 835 2122: -no ma'am
13/01/24, 11:10 am - Harmehak: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*
13/01/24, 11:10 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
13/01/24, 11:11 am - +263 78 835 2122: -ma'am the previous one hasn't loaded either so i doubt this one will
13/01/24, 11:15 am - Harmehak: You can go through the videos once you are able to in that case.
13/01/24, 11:16 am - Harmehak: Okay so Simelinkosi, can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. Through Edoofa in which country would you be pursuing your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in that country without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program (yearly fee after Edoofa Scholarship)?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your provisional offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
13/01/24, 1:12 pm - Harmehak: Kindly submit your responses.
13/01/24, 1:20 pm - +263 77 484 6799: Mng mng mum. How much is the total money should l pay for the first simmester including application
13/01/24, 1:21 pm - +263 77 484 6799: Simelinkosi is off line l think they are doing loundry since its weekend
13/01/24, 1:24 pm - Harmehak: I understand.
13/01/24, 1:25 pm - Harmehak: While the fee after the scholarship is $2000-3000, it's not supposed to be paid now,

The admissions team will assist you with a financial plan for easy planning of Simelinkosi's education.

Meanwhile she would be working under the Earn While You Learn Program.

Initially you would only be paying $350 in installments.
13/01/24, 1:30 pm - +263 77 484 6799: Oky oky for the first semester is 2000_3000 but this amount being paid in 350
13/01/24, 1:31 pm - +263 77 484 6799: Thanks mum you are so clear and understandeble
13/01/24, 1:32 pm - Harmehak: No please!
13/01/24, 1:32 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Mrs Nomusa, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
13/01/24, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if she is able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, she would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
13/01/24, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: For example if her fee is $1800, this is for two semesters which is inclusive of Tuition fee, Food, Accomodation and Basic university expenses.
13/01/24, 1:37 pm - +263 77 484 6799: Oky mum so simelinkosi should work hard to earn this high quantum schoolaship
13/01/24, 1:37 pm - Harmehak: Yes please!

Along with the same she would get the opportunity to work in the Earn While You Learn Program to reduce the fee even further!
13/01/24, 1:39 pm - +263 77 484 6799: Oky its so clear mum thank you so much
13/01/24, 1:39 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
13/01/24, 1:39 pm - Harmehak: Simelinkosi can answer these once she is available.
13/01/24, 1:40 pm - +263 77 484 6799: Oky mum she will
13/01/24, 1:40 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted
13/01/24, 1:42 pm - +263 77 484 6799: What about this 350 USD
13/01/24, 1:43 pm - Harmehak: Do you recall discussing about the enrollment fee which is paid once she is founded eligible?

*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations.
13/01/24, 1:44 pm - +263 77 484 6799: Well explained mum
13/01/24, 1:46 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate
13/01/24, 1:57 pm - +263 77 484 6799: Is Sindisiwe earning more scholarships
13/01/24, 1:58 pm - Harmehak: She is working under the Earn While You Learn Program and is currently in India too!

13/01/24, 2:26 pm - Harmehak: Both of you can connect.
13/01/24, 2:26 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Ruth is in Zimbabwe
13/01/24, 2:26 pm - Harmehak: You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.

15/01/24, 9:30 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start?
15/01/24, 9:32 am - +263 77 484 6799: Mng mng. Am fine
15/01/24, 9:32 am - +263 77 484 6799: We can
15/01/24, 9:34 am - +263 77 484 6799: For Simelinkosi now she is at School she cant make it maybe in her spare time or after School mum.
15/01/24, 9:58 am - Harmehak: I do understand please
15/01/24, 9:59 am - Harmehak: Mrs Nomusa, did you happen to connect with Mrs Ruth?
15/01/24, 11:01 am - +263 77 484 6799: Yes mum
15/01/24, 11:04 am - Harmehak: That's great
15/01/24, 11:04 am - Harmehak: Mrs Nomusa, are you willing to support Simelinkosi for her higher education in India mentally and financially?
15/01/24, 1:52 pm - +263 77 484 6799: Yes mum
15/01/24, 1:54 pm - +263 77 484 6799: Network problem mum
15/01/24, 1:57 pm - Harmehak: I understand
15/01/24, 1:58 pm - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
15/01/24, 1:58 pm - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
15/01/24, 1:58 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.

15/01/24, 2:18 pm - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 22nd or 23rd January 2024 for $200 and the  22nd or 23rd of February for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 22nd or 23rd January 2024. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
15/01/24, 2:21 pm - +263 77 484 6799: Is this for me or someone
15/01/24, 2:21 pm - Harmehak: You please!

15/01/24, 2:41 pm - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

15/01/24, 2:45 pm - Harmehak: Currently we are at Stage 2,

After the same we shall proceed for Video Call interview with the Program Director.
15/01/24, 2:47 pm - +263 77 484 6799: Oky 2
15/01/24, 2:47 pm - Harmehak: I didn't get you please.

Can you share what you are saying?
15/01/24, 2:49 pm - +263 77 484 6799: Reffering the stage
15/01/24, 2:49 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted.
15/01/24, 2:49 pm - Harmehak: All the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake, Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways:

1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:- Having a head start that too of more than 20 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.

Giving you an example, Persistance Muza the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself. 

This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.

2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:- Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels. 

3,  Having the benefit of the Community:- This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.
15/01/24, 2:52 pm - +263 77 484 6799: 350usa ipaid this month
15/01/24, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: You can pay in Installments of $200-$150 as well.
