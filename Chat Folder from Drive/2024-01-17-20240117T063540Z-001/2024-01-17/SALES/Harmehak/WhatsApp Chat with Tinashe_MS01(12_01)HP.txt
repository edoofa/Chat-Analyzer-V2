I can see your inclination towards Engineering considering it has been your passion!
12/01/24, 10:03 am - Harmehak: So Tinashe, now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
12/01/24, 10:05 am - +263 78 411 6003: Yes I believe it's a life changing. I have carefully researched your school academic programmes and found that they align perfectly with my career aspirations

12/01/24, 10:12 am - Harmehak: I am delighted to see your commitment, as expressed, Tinashe.
12/01/24, 10:13 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
12/01/24, 10:15 am - +263 78 411 6003: Understood. And I'm confident
12/01/24, 10:18 am - Harmehak: So Tinashe, can you share your O Level results with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Engineering?
12/01/24, 10:26 am - +263 78 411 6003: Okay here is list of my O level results

12/01/24, 10:56 am - Harmehak: That's definitely well thought off and I appreciate your understanding.
12/01/24, 10:56 am - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
12/01/24, 11:03 am - +263 77 352 5299: So then what other courses do offer which suits his qualifications
12/01/24, 11:04 am - +263 78 411 6003: Unfortunately I did not study chemistry.i studied Maths ,Physics and Geography as a science subject

12/01/24, 1:32 pm - Harmehak: Did you thoroughly go through all the shared information and resources, Tinashe?
12/01/24, 1:33 pm - +263 78 411 6003: Yes I did
12/01/24, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

So far, do you have any queries for me?
12/01/24, 1:36 pm - +263 78 411 6003: No
12/01/24, 1:37 pm - Harmehak: Alright, Tinashe.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
12/01/24, 1:40 pm - +263 78 411 6003: Unfortunately we are all unfamiliar with the costs
12/01/24, 1:40 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please
12/01/24, 1:40 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
12/01/24, 1:41 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
12/01/24, 1:41 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
12/01/24, 1:41 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 2:18 pm - +263 78 411 6003: Understood thank you
12/01/24, 2:19 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
12/01/24, 2:40 pm - +263 78 411 6003: The cost is good and affordable
12/01/24, 2:43 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate.

Are you and your parents aware that the child of the Deputy Head of the school is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program too?
12/01/24, 2:46 pm - +263 78 411 6003: No we are not
12/01/24, 2:47 pm - Harmehak: Isn't it exciting to know the same, now?
12/01/24, 2:48 pm - +263 78 411 6003: It's so much exciting now that we are aware of it
12/01/24, 2:49 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
12/01/24, 2:49 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

12/01/24, 3:23 pm - Harmehak: Mrs and Mr Madhume, you can participate if Tinashe isn't available.
12/01/24, 5:32 pm - +263 78 411 6003: Okay I'm now available..okay thank you I understood
12/01/24, 5:33 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate,

However kindly ensure active participation.
12/01/24, 5:33 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
12/01/24, 5:34 pm - +263 78 411 6003: Okay
12/01/24, 5:35 pm - +263 78 411 6003: Noted
12/01/24, 5:36 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

12/01/24, 5:56 pm - +263 78 411 6003: Noted
12/01/24, 5:56 pm - Harmehak: As of now, do you have any queries for me, Tinashe?
12/01/24, 5:56 pm - +263 78 411 6003: No
12/01/24, 5:57 pm - Harmehak: Alright!

So kindly feel free to connect yourself or your parents with Deputy Head in case you wish to learn more!
12/01/24, 5:57 pm - +263 78 411 6003: Okay thank you
12/01/24, 5:58 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
12/01/24, 6:06 pm - +263 78 411 6003: Yes I'm ready
12/01/24, 6:10 pm - Harmehak: Tinashe, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
12/01/24, 6:10 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
12/01/24, 6:17 pm - +263 78 411 6003: Around $1500, which is a large amount
12/01/24, 6:19 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
12/01/24, 6:19 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 6:19 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
12/01/24, 6:23 pm - +263 78 411 6003: Noted
12/01/24, 6:23 pm - Harmehak: Tinashe, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
12/01/24, 6:25 pm - +263 78 411 6003: Yes I do
12/01/24, 6:26 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
12/01/24, 6:26 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
12/01/24, 6:26 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
12/01/24, 6:31 pm - +263 78 411 6003: Understood
12/01/24, 6:31 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
12/01/24, 6:31 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 6:32 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
12/01/24, 6:32 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
12/01/24, 6:32 pm - +263 78 411 6003: Ok
12/01/24, 6:35 pm - +263 78 411 6003: Yes
12/01/24, 6:35 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
12/01/24, 6:35 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
12/01/24, 6:35 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

12/01/24, 6:40 pm - +263 78 411 6003: Noted ✅
12/01/24, 6:40 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
12/01/24, 6:40 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

12/01/24, 6:45 pm - Harmehak: Do connect your parents with Mrs Ruth as well, Tinashe!
12/01/24, 6:45 pm - +263 78 411 6003: Ok
12/01/24, 6:46 pm - Harmehak: As of now would you like to ask anything, Tinashe?
12/01/24, 6:46 pm - +263 78 411 6003: No, still good
12/01/24, 6:47 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
12/01/24, 6:47 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
12/01/24, 6:47 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

12/01/24, 7:05 pm - +263 77 352 5299: Thank you
12/01/24, 7:05 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
13/01/24, 11:27 am - Harmehak: Good Morning Everyone, Hope you are doing well.

I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

Are we good to proceed with your application now?
13/01/24, 11:27 am - +263 78 411 6003: Morning how are you, we can proceed
13/01/24, 11:28 am - +263 77 221 4265: Morning everyone, we can proceed
13/01/24, 11:30 am - Harmehak: I am doing well please,

That's great!

How was the discussion as a family?
13/01/24, 11:31 am - +263 77 221 4265: We are of the view to proceed with the scholarship
13/01/24, 11:33 am - Harmehak: I appreciate please,

So far do you have any queries for me?
13/01/24, 11:33 am - +263 77 221 4265: We are still to pick one
13/01/24, 11:34 am - +263 78 411 6003: No
13/01/24, 11:35 am - Harmehak: Duly noted.
13/01/24, 11:35 am - Harmehak: Have you already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? 

You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success. The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future.
13/01/24, 11:39 am - +263 77 221 4265: Personally, I am yet to get contact of her but from what you are saying it's an inspirational story
13/01/24, 11:40 am - Harmehak: I appreciate, Mr Madhume.

Do take out time to connect with her,

You will surely learn alot from a parent itself.
13/01/24, 11:41 am - +263 77 221 4265: True
13/01/24, 11:44 am - Harmehak: Yes please
13/01/24, 11:44 am - Harmehak: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*
13/01/24, 11:45 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

13/01/24, 11:51 am - Harmehak: That's wonderful
13/01/24, 11:53 am - Harmehak: Okay so Tinashe, can you tell me:-

7. After receiving your offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

13/01/24, 1:26 pm - Harmehak: *Bachelor of Design [B.Des]* in Communication Design is a 4-year full time undergraduate course. The programme is divided into 8 semesters of six months each.

Graphic Design is a specialised branch of communication design, and candidates wishing to specialise in this need to start out with a degree in communication design, which would allow them to specialise in graphic design after second year.
The course is best suited for those who are interested in seeking a career in anything from marketing companies to government agencies.

Having a bachelors in communication design opens the gateway to being a graphic artist, merchandiser, creative director or website designer. One may work in industries including media, public relations, communications, education and business.

Projects in this line of work include customized web-design for various merchandisers, creating advertisements for small businesses, developing magazine layouts or graphic designing for video games among other things. Some standard skills required for the aforementioned careers include creativity, knowledge of design techniques, familiarity with various multimedia and other relevant technical skills. Any design course fundamentally caters to those creatively inclined and left-brain oriented, equipping them with the necessary skills to make a career out of essentially thinking outside the box.

*What is it about?*

The program has been designed to offer the eligible students a course that concentrates on the conceptualisation, ‘design’, and execution of an idea. It can range from an advertisement to a movie, anything at all which needs to be graphically designed, the technology and software’s associated with it. The study of the course includes subjects like typography, colour theory, and layout theory. A B.Des degree in Graphic introduces a student to the industry of graphic design, understanding its history and its future, and to the technology and equipment required to design something. It focuses on the principles of design such as balance, contrast, movement and rhythm, etc., on typography, creating images for web and print, editing images, and ultimately leadership skills required to lead a team with your idea in this industry.  

This line of design is growing relevance in contemporary times. Everything today from education to markets of all types have now gained either a secondary digital presence, or operate solely in the digital space. Not only has digitization allowed producers to find wider markets but also allowed niche producers to find consumers that fit their specific demographic. Digitisation has eliminated, in various cases, costs associated with commute and thus made web-designing and digital branding critical to commerce today. Thus graduates in graphic design definitely are fit for the current ‘virtual market’ age. In fact, they have become quite indispensable in almost all industries today.

To sustain in this field one must be equipped with exceptional analytical skills and consumer insight to cater designs to consumer sensibility as well as the client’s brand image. Their artistic ability must undoubtedly be of a high grade and they should have the computer skills to translate their art into a graphic design, with a strong sense of creativity. They must be able communicators so they can understand the client’s needs and communicate his or her vision, as well as be good at time management since in this field an employee is required to work on multiple projects at the same time.

*Career Prospects*

Bachelors of Design in Communication Design graduates may have job opportunities both in the private and the government sector due to changing nature of the economy in this digital age. Today everything is seen through a web interface, exists solely on a web interface, or expands through a web interface. Furthermore, advertising campaigns and branding have become exceedingly digitized and much more intricate in design. Thus graduates in this course have a plethora of job opportunities on offer. Manufacturing units, marketing agencies, fashion media, boutiques, hotels, etc. are examples of the various private sector enterprises that hire graphic design graduates.
Job profiles for both these sectors includes graphic designers that are concerned with the conceptualization, sketching, and creation of designs keeping in mind the needs of the clients and consumer susceptibility. Similarly Web designers are occupied with the creation of websites, and more specialized job profiles in this field include interaction designers, communications designers, service designers, and etc.  

The market today is perfect for a graphic design graduate considering their need across multiple industries. Most business and enterprises today, as well as government agencies require designers in order to make them accessible in this age of marketing and digitization.

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.
