You can address me as *Ms. Harmehak and we do have with us, Mr. Piyush who is the Head of Counseling and Mr. Jyotishman who is the Head of Admissions* and will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
08/01/24, 9:39 am - +263 78 948 2963: It's a honor talking to you 🫡
08/01/24, 9:43 am - Harmehak: Tadiwanashe, I can see you got to know about the program from your friend Claire, who recently became a part of the Edoofa Program!

So now can you please tell me, what is your understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and what all did you happen to learn from your friend?
08/01/24, 9:48 am - +263 78 948 2963: This message was deleted
08/01/24, 9:50 am - +263 78 948 2963: My understanding on the edoofa program is that it empowers students to be more focused on there studies without paying any money
08/01/24, 9:52 am - +263 78 948 2963: Claire taught me that the program is efficient and was willing to change our educational lifes
08/01/24, 9:52 am - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate?
08/01/24, 9:55 am - +263 78 948 2963: I mean it gets to provide extra monetary and financial support for bright students who are financially underpriviledged
08/01/24, 9:58 am - +263 78 948 2963: It also provides learning opportunities for passionate students who someway or the other are disadvantaged or are in need of a little financial boosting
08/01/24, 10:01 am - Harmehak: Well received, however scholarship is provided only on merit basis, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
08/01/24, 10:01 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
08/01/24, 10:07 am - +263 78 948 2963: I am more than delighted to learn more about the scholarship program. I will also be even more grateful and happy if I could get an opportunity to study with your scholarship aid.
Of the more than 2000 Zimbabwean applications I do hope to succeed and make it through among the required 5000 worldwide
08/01/24, 10:10 am - Harmehak: I appreciate
08/01/24, 10:11 am - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
08/01/24, 10:13 am - +263 78 948 2963: I do appreciate the clarity, so in actual fact the Edoofa program is a scholarship rather than sponsorship
08/01/24, 10:14 am - +263 78 948 2963: Nevertheless it would be more than an honour for me to be aided within my tuition with help of your program
08/01/24, 10:16 am - Harmehak: Yes please,

Do discuss with Claire once again regarding the entire process.
08/01/24, 10:16 am - Harmehak: I appreciate.
08/01/24, 10:16 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Tadiwanashe, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Pakame high charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
08/01/24, 11:05 am - +263 78 948 2963: Well personally   was borne on the 12th of June in 2006  I completed  O level in 2022 had 8 Bs  and 1A  and 2Bs and l am currently doing A level

08/01/24, 1:57 pm - +263 77 599 7822: Tadiwanashes first priority is to become a medical Doctor and his  second preference is in engineering (surveying)
08/01/24, 2:02 pm - Harmehak: While I completely understand, I can see she didn't pursue Biology in her A level, Mrs Diana!

While I believe it's a crucial science subject to be able to pursue Medicine;

What are your thoughts on the same?
08/01/24, 4:27 pm - Harmehak: I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
08/01/24, 10:24 pm - +263 77 599 7822: Noted with thanks
08/01/24, 10:26 pm - +263 77 599 7822: Tadiwanashe is a boy/ male.Yes for his Alevel  he isn't pursuing Biology🙆‍♀️🙆‍♀️🙆‍♀️
08/01/24, 10:27 pm - +263 77 599 7822: But he did it on Olevel and passed it.
09/01/24, 9:33 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
09/01/24, 12:32 pm - +263 77 599 7822: Morning yes we can start . It's the first day of school so we had an opening meeting my apologies for being late
09/01/24, 12:32 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please.
09/01/24, 12:33 pm - Harmehak: Excuse me for the same.
09/01/24, 12:33 pm - Harmehak: I understand.
09/01/24, 12:33 pm - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
09/01/24, 1:41 pm - +263 77 599 7822: Okay therefore  he doesn't fit for the healthcare course . Then engineering will be best for him .
09/01/24, 1:43 pm - +263 77 599 7822: May I have the list of engineering courses offered in indian universities since Engineering is a broad subject
09/01/24, 1:55 pm - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are :

*1. Bachelor in Pharmacy*
*2. Bachelor in Optometry*
*3. Bachelor of Technology in Biomedical Engineering*
*4. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*
*5. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*
09/01/24, 1:58 pm - Harmehak: Along with these courses he can pursue all the engineering courses like Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science Engineering, Electrical Engineering.
09/01/24, 6:49 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now, I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

15/01/24, 2:34 pm - Harmehak: *B.Tech Civil Engineering: What is it About?*

Civil engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines in the world. Civil engineering, until a few decades back, was a much sought after course among Indian students, but lately has been sidelined due to the software and IT boom. However with the increasing need to develop and maintain India’s infrastructure, which is lagging in all aspects, this field is bouncing back strongly.

There are options for higher studies after the completion of B.Tech. course. Students can pursue Master’s degree in specialized course. Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Civil engineering and other allied branches like-

*Structural Engineering*
*Architectural Engineering*
*Geotechnical Engineering*
*Environmental Engineering etc.*

*B.Tech Civil Engineering: Who should opt?*

Before you decide to pursue your undergraduate studies in this field, it is important to understand that Civil engineering is not just about buildings and bridges. If you are under the assumption that all that civil engineers do is wear a yellow helmet and supervise workers in construction sites, then you are yet to understand the true capacity of this field. 


*Career aspects*

In these cases, you will have to hunt for a core engineering job all by yourself through off-campus placements. Creating strong professional networks, developing a great resume with stellar GPA and doing impressive projects and internships will help you secure a job in one of the core civil engineering companies.

Also, civil engineers find work not just in construction industry, but also in other industries such as oil and energy, transportation, petroleum, environmental, power and electric utilities, chemical etc where infrastructure projects and construction facilities are involved. Some students transition to software, consulting or banking as they feel that salary and growth prospects are better in these sectors.
15/01/24, 2:35 pm - Harmehak: *Bachelor of Pharmacy(B.Pharm.)* is a 4 year undergraduate program which is compulsory for anyone who wants to practice as a pharmacist. B. Pharmacy is study of preparing and conferring drugs and medicines for a number of illnesses and deficiencies.

Pharmacists are needed in every location and every hospital, due to which the scope of this course has increased positively. The program has been bringing out healthcare professionals from a long time and would continue to do so for years to come as the field is growing at a fast pace.

*Bachelor of Pharmacy: What is it about?*

Bachelor of Pharmacy (B.Pharma) covers all the facets of healthcare including bio-chemical areas that concern the preparation of medicines and implementing those for the right diagnose.

16/01/24, 7:15 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, so I would be scheduling your session for *Thursday at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
