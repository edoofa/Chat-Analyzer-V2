Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
12/01/24, 10:36 am - +263 77 303 0537: Thank you
12/01/24, 10:42 am - +263 77 993 7510: Well... yes I believe it's a life changing decision 
Higher education abroad is basically most wanted by many different companies as they see quality service offered from education abroad 
And this is also my wish to study abroad and get quality education as it will be easy for me to get employed world wide
12/01/24, 10:43 am - Harmehak: Well put across, Evidence.

Would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
12/01/24, 10:45 am - +263 77 993 7510: Yes I am mentally prepared for a life abroad too Ms Harmehak
12/01/24, 10:53 am - Harmehak: Evidence, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially along with the scholarship?
12/01/24, 11:01 am - +263 77 993 7510: Well I would like to say they do support my education abroad mentally and financially along with the scholarship 
But I would like to say there are financially challenged  
And I also agree
12/01/24, 11:07 am - Harmehak: I do understand please.

However you would agree with me that higher education would require financial support, isn't it?
12/01/24, 11:08 am - +263 77 993 7510: Yes I do I gree
12/01/24, 11:09 am - Harmehak: While I would brief you regarding the costs and how they are made affordable!

Are they willing to support?
12/01/24, 11:11 am - +263 77 303 0537: Give us a brief outline of the costs please
12/01/24, 11:33 am - +263 77 993 7510: Yes
12/01/24, 11:44 am - Harmehak: I will be discussing the same in detail itself as we proceed ahead!
12/01/24, 11:44 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
12/01/24, 11:46 am - +263 77 993 7510: Yes I am
12/01/24, 12:07 pm - Harmehak: That's great
12/01/24, 12:07 pm - Harmehak: So, can you share your O Level results with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Forensic Accounting and auditing?
12/01/24, 12:38 pm - +263 77 993 7510: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 12:49 pm - Harmehak: Received please
12/01/24, 12:49 pm - Harmehak: Kindly address the other part of the question.
12/01/24, 1:05 pm - +263 77 993 7510: Ok
12/01/24, 1:13 pm - +263 77 993 7510: Sorry I am having network problem
What motivate me are other people who have studied this program and did well and they archive so much

12/01/24, 2:55 pm - +263 77 993 7510: Firstly I have been wondering to study abroad and also need to experience life out of my country
And  Universities in abroad offer best programs
12/01/24, 2:56 pm - Harmehak: That is wonderful, I can see you are aiming at maximum exposure.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*

12/01/24, 3:14 pm - Harmehak: I am glad, Evidence.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
12/01/24, 3:16 pm - +263 77 993 7510: No we are not aware of the cost
12/01/24, 3:16 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
12/01/24, 3:16 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
12/01/24, 3:17 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
12/01/24, 3:17 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
12/01/24, 3:17 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 3:23 pm - +263 77 993 7510: Noted 
And this is good
12/01/24, 3:24 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Evidence, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
12/01/24, 3:24 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.

What are your thoughts on the same please?
12/01/24, 3:26 pm - +263 77 993 7510: This is good as the cost is being reduced
12/01/24, 3:28 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate.
12/01/24, 3:29 pm - Harmehak: Evidence, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
12/01/24, 4:11 pm - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation.
12/01/24, 4:56 pm - +263 77 993 7510: I am sorry Ms Harmehak i had poor Network coverage 
Yes i do agree
12/01/24, 4:57 pm - Harmehak: I understand.

So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Evidence?
12/01/24, 5:01 pm - +263 77 993 7510: Yes now I know Edoofa is making higher education affordable
12/01/24, 5:02 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
12/01/24, 5:02 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
12/01/24, 5:02 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
12/01/24, 5:02 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

12/01/24, 5:10 pm - +263 77 993 7510: Noted
12/01/24, 5:10 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
12/01/24, 5:13 pm - +263 77 993 7510: Okay i get it
12/01/24, 5:14 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

12/01/24, 5:50 pm - +263 77 993 7510: I am here
12/01/24, 5:52 pm - +263 77 993 7510: Okay well I understand
12/01/24, 5:52 pm - Harmehak: That's great
12/01/24, 5:53 pm - Harmehak: So Evidence, are you aware that the child of Deputy Head of Mt Selinda is also a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program?
12/01/24, 5:55 pm - +263 77 993 7510: No I wasn't aware
12/01/24, 5:56 pm - Harmehak: I can understand!

How exciting it is to know the same now?
12/01/24, 6:01 pm - +263 77 993 7510: too much excited 
Thank you
12/01/24, 6:02 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
12/01/24, 6:07 pm - +263 77 993 7510: Yes I am
12/01/24, 6:11 pm - Harmehak: Evidence, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
12/01/24, 6:11 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
12/01/24, 6:24 pm - +263 77 993 7510: Okay Ms Harmehak I am getting it
12/01/24, 6:25 pm - Harmehak: Great!

So how much would a student spend without Edoofa?
12/01/24, 6:27 pm - +263 77 993 7510: Around $1500 to $2250
12/01/24, 6:27 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
12/01/24, 6:27 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 6:27 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
12/01/24, 6:29 pm - +263 77 993 7510: Okay
12/01/24, 6:29 pm - Harmehak: You see Evidence, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so, Evidence? <This message was edited>
12/01/24, 6:45 pm - Harmehak: I believe you would recall regarding the active participation please, Evidence?
12/01/24, 6:48 pm - +263 77 993 7510: Okay
12/01/24, 6:49 pm - +263 77 993 7510: Well 
I do think so
12/01/24, 6:49 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
12/01/24, 6:49 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
12/01/24, 6:49 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
12/01/24, 6:53 pm - +263 77 993 7510: Okay I understand
12/01/24, 6:57 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
12/01/24, 6:57 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 6:57 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
12/01/24, 6:57 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
12/01/24, 7:01 pm - +263 77 993 7510: Yes I do
12/01/24, 7:02 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
12/01/24, 7:02 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
12/01/24, 7:02 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
12/01/24, 7:02 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 7:05 pm - +263 77 993 7510: Okay  noted
12/01/24, 7:06 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
12/01/24, 7:06 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
12/01/24, 7:06 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 7:07 pm - +263 77 993 7510: Okay thank you
12/01/24, 7:09 pm - Harmehak: Do connect Mrs Ruth with your aunt too, Evidence!
12/01/24, 7:15 pm - +263 77 993 7510: Okay
12/01/24, 7:15 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
12/01/24, 7:15 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
12/01/24, 7:15 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

12/01/24, 7:21 pm - +263 77 993 7510: Thank you
13/01/24, 11:26 am - Harmehak: Good Morning Everyone, Hope you are doing well.

I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

Are we good to proceed with your application now?
13/01/24, 11:38 am - +263 77 993 7510: Morning we are still in the process of discussing
13/01/24, 11:38 am - Harmehak: I do understand.

What all points have you discussed so far?
13/01/24, 11:42 am - +263 77 993 7510: We haven't talk much there were still at work

13/01/24, 11:43 am - Harmehak: I do understand.
13/01/24, 11:43 am - Harmehak: Have you already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? 

You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success. The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future.
13/01/24, 11:44 am - +263 77 993 7510: Yes I did
13/01/24, 11:45 am - Harmehak: That's great,

13/01/24, 11:50 am - Harmehak: That's great!
13/01/24, 11:50 am - Harmehak: What is your take on the costs and affordability so far, Evidence?
13/01/24, 12:10 pm - +263 77 993 7510: Okay 
 So far they consider the cost for registration affordable
13/01/24, 12:20 pm - Harmehak: I do understand, Evidence
13/01/24, 12:20 pm - Harmehak: Do share your A level results.
13/01/24, 12:24 pm - +263 77 993 7510: Ok

13/01/24, 12:47 pm - +263 77 993 7510: Thank you
13/01/24, 12:49 pm - Harmehak: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*
13/01/24, 12:49 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
13/01/24, 12:51 pm - +263 77 993 7510: Ok

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. Through Edoofa in which country would you be pursuing your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in that country without a scholarship?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment.
