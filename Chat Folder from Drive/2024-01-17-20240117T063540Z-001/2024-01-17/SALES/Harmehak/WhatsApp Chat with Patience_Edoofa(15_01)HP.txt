16/01/24, 10:58 am - +263 71 854 3137: Let me read through
16/01/24, 10:58 am - Harmehak: Sure please
16/01/24, 11:06 am - +263 71 854 3137: That's a pretty good job there 👏
16/01/24, 11:16 am - Harmehak: I appreciate
16/01/24, 11:16 am - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
16/01/24, 11:17 am - +263 71 854 3137: Exactly
16/01/24, 11:19 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Patience, now to help you in Becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD University of Zimbabwe charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
16/01/24, 11:30 am - +263 71 854 3137: Alright then
16/01/24, 11:33 am - Harmehak: Yes please
16/01/24, 11:52 am - +263 71 854 3137: I'm Patience Taurai, female aged 23 and I will be turning 24 very soon this coming April.
I live in Stoneridge Park in Harare with my parents and my brothers four of them. I'm the only girl child. Being the first born child, all my 4 siblings are still going to school. 

I'm currently a part4 medical student in Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBChB) at the University of Zimbabwe. There every semester I'm being charged USD$725 excluding residence fee, it is just tuition. I commute from home every day going to school. Which is the main reason i need help. I'm finding it difficult to finish up the remaining 3 years since a medical degree is attained in 6 years. 
I wish to complete my studies.
I really like learning through conversing with different people from different settings as it offers me an opportunity to learn more apart from the classroom. I enjoy volunteering into activities that help the community as helping out is my passion.
I find it hard to seek help, i often feel like asking for help is a sign of irresponsibility. I'm working towards correcting that perception towards help.

We live as a family(7 of us) in a 3 roomed house. My siblings are still in high school except for one who is still in primary school. They all learn at local day schools. My mother is a housewife, unemployed whereas my father is a warehouse supervisor at a company that sells tiles and aluminium. My father's highest level of education is Ordinary level where he didn't do quite well. My mother didn't manage to get to Ordinary level she dropped out along the way.
16/01/24, 11:53 am - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Patience, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!
16/01/24, 11:54 am - +263 71 854 3137: Thank you
16/01/24, 12:01 pm - Harmehak: Patience, firstly, are you clear that the program is for those who wish to study in India?
16/01/24, 12:08 pm - +263 71 854 3137: Yes
16/01/24, 12:10 pm - Harmehak: While you expressed that already are pursuing Medicine there,

How do you plan on studying in India?
16/01/24, 12:15 pm - +263 71 854 3137: Well, i think I forgot to tell that i have a premedical degree, Biomedical Sciences. I completed it last year August. So post that degree i only have a semester in MBChB
16/01/24, 12:16 pm - +263 71 854 3137: Here, one attain a premedical degree first then will be accepted into MBChB as a postgarads degree. If one is to go to any country will use that premed degree
16/01/24, 12:21 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted Patience.

Kindly share your documents and your area/field of Post Graduation
16/01/24, 12:30 pm - +263 71 854 3137: Okay
16/01/24, 12:33 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
16/01/24, 12:45 pm - +263 71 854 3137: <Media omitted>
16/01/24, 12:45 pm - +263 71 854 3137: <Media omitted>
16/01/24, 12:53 pm - Harmehak: Received please
16/01/24, 12:53 pm - Harmehak: Kindly address the other half.
16/01/24, 12:56 pm - +263 71 854 3137: MBChB which is Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery
16/01/24, 1:00 pm - Harmehak: Alright, however why does your degree state Biomedical Sciences please?
16/01/24, 1:05 pm - +263 71 854 3137: Biomedical Sciences is an undergrad prerequisite into MBChB. Here, one will not be accepted into MBChB without it. That's the undergrad degree with all preclinical courses. One isn't accepted into it from Advanced level. So one gets it then apply for MBChB
16/01/24, 1:08 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please
16/01/24, 1:09 pm - +263 71 854 3137: Alright
16/01/24, 1:10 pm - Harmehak: However while I submitted your documents, it was shared that you are eligible to pursue Msc Biomedical here in India itself.
16/01/24, 1:12 pm - +263 71 854 3137: Okay
16/01/24, 1:12 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
16/01/24, 1:13 pm - Harmehak: Here in India, students directly pursue MBBS after their Grade 12 that is A level exams.
16/01/24, 1:14 pm - +263 71 854 3137: MBBS? 
Is that the equiv of MBChB?
16/01/24, 1:16 pm - Harmehak: MBBS is Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery.
16/01/24, 1:17 pm - +263 71 854 3137: Okay, i get it
16/01/24, 1:17 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
16/01/24, 4:11 pm - Harmehak: As of now, do you have any queries, Patience?
16/01/24, 4:26 pm - +263 71 854 3137: No, i don't have any questions.
16/01/24, 4:26 pm - +263 71 854 3137: Thank you!
16/01/24, 4:27 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
16/01/24, 4:27 pm - Harmehak: So how would you like to proceed ahead?
16/01/24, 4:32 pm - +263 71 854 3137: I was thinking, asking myself some questions if i can consider Msc Biomedical and I don't feel like it. Being a doctor to me is something internally driven so i have to pursue it.
16/01/24, 4:32 pm - +263 71 854 3137: Can you rephrase your question please
16/01/24, 4:34 pm - Harmehak: With MSC Biomedical
16/01/24, 4:35 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand, Patience.

Which is why I provided you with some time.
16/01/24, 4:35 pm - +263 71 854 3137: You are very considerate, thank you!
16/01/24, 4:38 pm - Harmehak: You're welcome!

I wish you a blessed day ahead, Patience.
16/01/24, 4:40 pm - +263 71 854 3137: You, too!
16/01/24, 4:41 pm - Harmehak: Thank you Patience
16/01/24, 4:42 pm - +263 71 854 3137: So what would happen next?
16/01/24, 4:42 pm - Harmehak: You cannot pursue Medicine in India, please.
16/01/24, 4:45 pm - +263 71 854 3137: That's okay 🙂
