12/01/24, 4:53 pm - +263 77 531 5942: My name is Blessed Ingwani. I was born on 10 February 2005 and I'm 18 now. I live in a small village called Makwaha. My father is a teacher and my mother is an agricultural extension officer. My parents know the importance of education and they give in whatever they have to make sure that we go to school but up to a certain limit. I attended my primary school at Mafumise primary school and I scored 10 units. I then attended High School at Mt Selinda High and I managed to get 4As and 6Bs doing pure sciences. I came back to Mt Selinda High again to do my A level because it was the one which my parents could afford. I was doing Mathematics Physics and Chemistry. I downloaded the results and I found out that I got 14 points. 
I want to do electrical and electronic engineering and our duty as engineers is to solve problems. That's where my big dream is. I am a man who's good at team work, reading, hard working, creative and I'm a person who strives to be a better somebody in the future. I am a good at socialism. 
My favorite hobby is playing darts and chess since they are smart games and they improve mental calculation and thinking capacity. I managed to go to the national darts championship and I can in position 4

13/01/24, 10:31 am - +263 77 531 5942: There is this company which is in my village called Mobility for African. It uses electric bikes and I loved the setup of the bikes and the way the solar systems were mounted. This company motivated me a lot. The second thing is on my dream which is to make sure that there are no power cuts in my country
13/01/24, 10:32 am - Harmehak: Received please.

13/01/24, 11:16 am - +263 77 531 5942: India offers a lot of scholarships and quality education. On Facebook I met almost 20 scholarships
13/01/24, 11:17 am - +263 77 143 1909: Good to hear
13/01/24, 11:17 am - Harmehak: I appreciate
13/01/24, 11:18 am - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you,

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
13/01/24, 11:21 am - +263 77 143 1909: I am not aware about fees structure can you shed more light
13/01/24, 11:21 am - Harmehak: Sure please
13/01/24, 11:21 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
13/01/24, 11:22 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
13/01/24, 11:22 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
13/01/24, 11:22 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
13/01/24, 11:51 am - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation.

15/01/24, 9:26 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start?
15/01/24, 8:04 pm - Harmehak: Blessed,

I am expecting to hear from you since Saturday!

While the other students from the school have already reached Interview Stage.

May I know the reason behind such delay from your end?
15/01/24, 8:46 pm - +263 77 531 5942: I was doing the processes of applying for a passport which is the very important thing on the scholarship issues. I apologize for poor communication. I think the process will be over tomorrow.
15/01/24, 8:47 pm - Harmehak: While I do understand,

I hope you understand that it's important to inform me the same?
15/01/24, 8:49 pm - +263 77 531 5942: Im really sorry 🙏
15/01/24, 8:50 pm - Harmehak: I do understand Blessed.

Let me schedule the discussion for tomorrow at *9:30 AM CAT*.

Wishing you all a blessed evening ahead!
15/01/24, 8:54 pm - +263 77 531 5942: The passport processing is  not yet over. They start the processing at 8:00 until late. So tomorrow I might not be available. Will you please allow me to finish the process
15/01/24, 8:55 pm - Harmehak: That's alright Blessed.

However you can request your parents to finish the discussion on your behalf.
15/01/24, 8:56 pm - +263 77 531 5942: Thanks you. My parents will be available
15/01/24, 8:57 pm - +263 77 531 5942: But my father is a teacher so he might be at school on 9:30
15/01/24, 8:58 pm - Harmehak: I understand,

Either of them can continue.
15/01/24, 9:01 pm - +263 77 531 5942: It's ok thank you
15/01/24, 9:01 pm - Harmehak: You're welcome
16/01/24, 9:33 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
16/01/24, 10:08 am - +263 77 143 1909: Am really so for coming late for discussion. Network is a problem herr
16/01/24, 10:11 am - Harmehak: I do understand please
16/01/24, 10:11 am - Harmehak: Have you followed the discussion so far please?
16/01/24, 10:12 am - +263 77 143 1909: Thank you Yes I am following discussions and am understanding more and more
16/01/24, 10:12 am - Harmehak: I appreciate!
16/01/24, 10:12 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
16/01/24, 10:41 am - Harmehak: @263771431909
16/01/24, 10:44 am - +263 77 143 1909: I think it's quite good because my intention is for my child to get a scholarship for him to archeive his wishes. 100% will be greatly appreciated.
16/01/24, 10:44 am - Harmehak: I thoroughly appreciate your kind words and support for Blessed!
16/01/24, 10:44 am - +263 77 143 1909: You are welcome
16/01/24, 10:45 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
16/01/24, 10:45 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
16/01/24, 10:45 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
16/01/24, 10:45 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
