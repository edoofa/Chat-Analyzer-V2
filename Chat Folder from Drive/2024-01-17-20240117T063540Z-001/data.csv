While I understand and appreciate that you are working to finance your education, it is crucial for you to finish your EWYL orientation with me, as mentioned earlier. If you are not able to do that, you can ask your parents to attend the session with me and understand the basics of the program.  This will ensure a smooth process, and we can later connect on the projects only. Please let me know if you proceed in this manner.

112 - 16 Jan 2024 02:28PM - Saloni Edoofa: One-on-one conversations have altogether different impact. It has a lot of impact on their perspective of Edoofa. Once you approach any individual, you must talk about these few things with them:
113 - 16 Jan 2024 02:28PM - Saloni Edoofa: 1. Introduce yourself as a student ambassador of Edoofa, and tell about what were your initial thoughts about Edoofa and how this process started. Talk about how you started with the counseling process, clarifying your doubts with your dedicated counselor, choosing the right course, how Inia can be the right destination, and then finally passing the eligibility tests.  2. Then tell them about starting with your Admission process which will help you in choosing the right University, documentation work, Visa process, travel arrangements, getting the offer letter from the Universities, and many more. <This message was edited>
114 - 16 Jan 2024 02:28PM - Saloni Edoofa: 3. Then tell them about the EWYL Program. Through this scholarship Program, they have already reduced their University fees, and through this program, they can reduce their University fees partially or fully. Tell them about how they can upskill themselves through weekly lessons, activities, and newsletters, and how they can earn virtual scholarship credits that can be adjusted in their University fees.
115 - 16 Jan 2024 02:29PM - Saloni Edoofa: Then share them about the Department of Student Welfare. This is a specialized Department that we have created to cater to the needs and requirements of our Indian Edoofians.

She successfully identified and reached out to three potential schools to meet her targets. Interestingly, she utilized Google for her research. Loice performed searches like 'School nearby,' 'School in Harare,' and 'School in Manicaland,' generating valuable results. Remarkably, she achieved this without physically visiting the schools. Using Google, she gathered essential information, including contact details, and then initiated communication with them via WhatsApp.

93 - 16 Jan 2024 02:29PM - +263 71 989 7144: The audio is talking about Community Building whereby it is being referred to as being a process of establishing and strengthening connections, relationships and shared identities among individuals within a particular group or community. It involves creating a supportive and inclusive environment where people feel a sense of belonging and are able to collaborate and communicate. The goal is to foster a positive and cohesive community that promotes social interaction and participation as well as a sense of responsibility in order to be able to achieve our determined goals. One of the aims of this project for students to learn how to liberate social media in order to help African students to join Edoofa and have the same opportunity we had to acquire international education. The project also encourages students who have a mindset of identifying opportunities and sharing them openly to create something that will have an impact in the life of others. To complete this project we are encouraged to reach to African students who just finished their senior year or who are in their senior year in Secondary school and persuade and refer these students to the program and the head of the organization. Lastly the audio goes ahead to mention the scholarship credits that each student will earn for completing the project.

56 - 16 Jan 2024 12:46PM - Saloni Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - *EDOOFA -Education For All.*  To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *a lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as a mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!üéâ
57 - 16 Jan 2024 12:46PM - Saloni Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of* more than 3000 students* from different countriesüìç  Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains

59 - 16 Jan 2024 12:46PM - Saloni Edoofa: I'm [Your Name], grateful for the Edoofa Scholarship taking me to study in India. With high tuition fees in Zimbabwe, this opportunity is a dream come true. Back in Zimbabwe, internet costs were steep‚Äîaround $500 annually. In India, it's just $40 a year, showing how much they value education. In Zimbabwe, limited seats and job struggles after graduation were concerns. Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program eased these worries, offering $50 to $100 monthly. Following the 5S principles helped me secure this scholarship. I encourage you to do the same. Counselors will ask questions based on the flyer attached. Best of luck! Your dreams are closer than you think

A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best.

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process. This reduced cost includes: *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*

Affordability: Medicine is one of the most expensive courses everywhere in the world, as it requires high-class facilities and great doctors and mentors to teach that.  2. Eligibility: India is a great place to study for higher education as it has both qualities of education and affordability, but for medicine in India, you need to give an entrance exam named NEET, which is very competitive and only 1000 students are selected from millions each year.  3. Length of the program: Medicine is a 6-8 years course including the internships(attachment) that are mandatory, so it also contributes to the affordability issue.  But I realize that you want to do a course that makes your parents proud and also align with your passion. So you can go ahead with the courses in Medical Field such as  1. Bachelor of Science in Nursing 2. Bachelors in  Pharmacy 3. Bachelors in Physiotherapy 4. Bachelor of Science in Medical Lab Technology  These courses have a lesser duration than Medicine and are more affordable for students.

68 - 16 Jan 2024 10:50AM - +263 78 457 9175: Yes sure. I need more clarity please
69 - 16 Jan 2024 11:02AM - Garima Edoofa: *Bachelor in Physiotherapy* is a branch of healthcare that applies modes of physical movement such as exercise, massage, besides education, advice, and counselling services to circumstances where movement and function are threatened by ageing, pain, injury, diseases, disorders, conditions, or other environmental factors.  Students enrolled to the course are taught on an advanced level about core physiotherapeutic skills such as manual therapy, therapeutic exercises, and application of electro-physical modalities, which have been proven to cure a range of disabilities and disease related to spine, back, neck, and even stress-related incontinence.  Bachelor of Physiotherapy is a 4-year undergraduate course, including compulsory 6 months of clinical internship, and involving the science of physical movement aimed at preventing disease and disability.  The opportunities for a career in Physiotherapy are excellent, whether in the public health system, private practice or non-government organisations. Career pathways include the disciplines and areas of:  *Healthcare Management* *Industrial Rehabilitation* *Research & Academics* *Special Schools* *Multinational companies for fitness of their employers*

76 - 16 Jan 2024 11:22AM - Garima Edoofa: When students reach their pre-final year, they participate in placement drives conducted by various multinational corporations, startups, and organizations. During these drives, students go through interviews, and if they demonstrate proficiency, they end up receiving job offers from these companies. Depending on the job offer, students have the option to apply for a work permit that allows them to extend their stay in India for the duration of their employment.
77 - 16 Jan 2024 11:22AM - Garima Edoofa: Moreover, the EWYL program for you is specifically designed so that you as a student are able to learn the 21st-century skills which are certainly required for every student to be employable ready. Through EWYL you will boost your confidence which is going to help you in the future and with the skills learned you will definitely be employable ready.

82 - 16 Jan 2024 01:24PM - +263 78 457 9175: Physiotherapy gives me a time advantage of getting into the field early and implement what I have learnt at school much earlier.  After 5 years of completion I see myself : 1: As a person who is now able to be of great help to the social community we live in, by providing basic education to people on the importance of getting physiotherapy without anyone judging my capabilities just from the internet. 2: I see myself being held in prestigious posts and being an example through the Zimbabwean community as I would have raised the slogan # Girl child in a prominent positions. 3:I  see myself globally networked with other physicians, helping and giving each other suitable add on knowledge that's not just from written work but from experiences in the line of work. 4: I see myself innovating some practices that go well with this program that will help in training people with physical ailments 5: Over whelmed with joy working under such a branch that is connected to getting people better. And I see mysf trying by all means to help in anyway I can to make them feel better.
83 - 16 Jan 2024 01:26PM - +263 78 457 9175: Getting into Edoofa to me is not just the scholarship for me but it's about how supportive this program is. For me Edoofa will help me achieve my dreams by : 1: Offering me to learn at good universities and getting knowledge from the best tutors world wide. 2: Growing up I always wanted to be an ambassador of prestigious programs so getting into Edoofa I know I will get that chance to ambassador this name and take it to greater heights. 3: My aim in life was always to make my family proud of me and making the flag high for my family. So as an Edoofa I will get to experience that kind of pride within me. 4: it gives me a well vast connection with other people in different countries allowing me to be connected to different people and learning different culture and teaching me on how to get along with people of different ethnic backgrounds.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?

93 - 16 Jan 2024 02:55PM - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hard work for your community charlene, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you.  Don‚Äôt you agree?
94 - 16 Jan 2024 03:04PM - +263 78 457 9175: That's very true maam. Environment is one of the biggest determining factor of whether one succeeds or not. I believe that this scholarship program is not only going to provide me with the intricacies of my chosen trade but will provide me with an environment that will make it possible for me to thrive
116 - 16 Jan 2024 03:16PM - +263 78 457 9175: Thank you for the information. Let me read it for now
117 - 16 Jan 2024 03:19PM - Garima Edoofa: Yes, please.  let me know when you are done.
118 - 16 Jan 2024 03:25PM - +263 78 457 9175: Impressive resume and commendations.One can only wish and dream to be part of the impending Indian awakening
119 - 16 Jan 2024 03:27PM - Garima Edoofa: Okay well Charlene, since you have understood all the reasons properly as well, can you now tell me:-  1)How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career?  2)How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
120 - 16 Jan 2024 03:40PM - +263 78 457 9175: Studying in India will impact on my career in the following ways: ‚Ä¢I will be tutored and guided by some of the most competent minds in the area ‚Ä¢As there is cross-pollination between class and industry,I get to have first hand practical experience whilst still in class  I expect to achieve my career aspirations in the following ways: ‚Ä¢There are already working structures in place in India which have allowed some to be CEOs of international companies which I will make use of. ‚Ä¢The list of rich women in India shows that gender is no bar in Indian society-you can succeed regardless ‚Ä¢The moving in of big organizations like Tesla into the Indian market means creation of more opportunities for all concerned
121 - 16 Jan 2024 04:00PM - Garima Edoofa: That is remarkable, Charlene. I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing the education, the student is capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.  Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
122 - 16 Jan 2024 04:14PM - +263 78 457 9175: Thank you. I'm not aware of the cost.
123 - 16 Jan 2024 04:15PM - Garima Edoofa: Let me help you brief about the cost.

125 - 16 Jan 2024 04:17PM - Garima Edoofa: Before moving ahead, could you please send me your A-level result?
136 - 16 Jan 2024 04:39PM - Garima Edoofa: 2. *Recruitment Partners*: -  Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:- -Nigenuis -Skooqs -Success Magazine -TIA Organics
137 - 16 Jan 2024 04:39PM - Garima Edoofa: 3. *Webinars*: -  We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: - Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade. How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu It‚Äôs never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
138 - 16 Jan 2024 04:39PM - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
139 - 16 Jan 2024 04:39PM - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.  These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.  What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
140 - 16 Jan 2024 04:51PM - +263 78 457 9175: Very enlightening and a very innovative way of grooming prospect leaders.I can envision myself already being part of the community
141 - 16 Jan 2024 06:17PM - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
142 - 16 Jan 2024 06:17PM - Garima Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

169 - 16 Jan 2024 07:09PM - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :  1.*Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*‚Äã: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.  2.*Employability through practical training*‚Äã: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.   3.*Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What‚Äôs more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.   4.*Higher Education Concierge*‚Äã: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
170 - 16 Jan 2024 07:10PM - Garima Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
171 - 16 Jan 2024 09:29PM - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.  *Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation*

70 - 16 Jan 2024 03:47PM - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hard work for your community Magdaline, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you.  Don‚Äôt you agree?
108 - 16 Jan 2024 04:43PM - Garima Edoofa: 2. *Recruitment Partners*: -  Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:- -Nigenuis -Skooqs -Success Magazine -TIA Organics
109 - 16 Jan 2024 04:43PM - Garima Edoofa: 3. *Webinars*: -  We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: - Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade. How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu It‚Äôs never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
110 - 16 Jan 2024 04:43PM - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.  These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.  What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
111 - 16 Jan 2024 04:43PM - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
112 - 16 Jan 2024 04:47PM - +260 760061219: I think the Earn While You Learn is a very good program and I think it might benefit me as a student.
113 - 16 Jan 2024 06:18PM - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
114 - 16 Jan 2024 06:19PM - Garima Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.
115 - 16 Jan 2024 06:19PM - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
116 - 16 Jan 2024 06:19PM - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
117 - 16 Jan 2024 06:19PM - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
139 - 16 Jan 2024 06:19PM - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
140 - 16 Jan 2024 06:28PM - +260 760061219: The program can really help if at all my guardians cannot manage. But also being put on the scholarship program reduces the amount paid yearly.
141 - 16 Jan 2024 06:39PM - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :  1.*Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*‚Äã: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.  2.*Employability through practical training*‚Äã: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.   3.*Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What‚Äôs more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.   4.*Higher Education Concierge*‚Äã: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
142 - 16 Jan 2024 06:39PM - Garima Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
143 - 16 Jan 2024 06:45PM - +260 760061219: Affordable through guarantee scholarship and Earn while you learn program
144 - 16 Jan 2024 07:07PM - Garima Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you have been looking for the same.   Alright Magdaline, basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
145 - 16 Jan 2024 07:18PM - +260 760061219: Yes they will be supporting me through out my journey
146 - 16 Jan 2024 07:29PM - Garima Edoofa: Alright Magdaline, basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.  Are you ready?
147 - 16 Jan 2024 07:30PM - +260 760061219: Yes please
148 - 16 Jan 2024 07:31PM - Garima Edoofa: Magdaline as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn‚Äôt given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
145 - 16 Jan 2024 07:18PM - +260 760061219: Yes they will be supporting me through out my journey
146 - 16 Jan 2024 07:29PM - Garima Edoofa: Alright Magdaline, basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same.

147 - 16 Jan 2024 07:30PM - +260 760061219: Yes please
148 - 16 Jan 2024 07:31PM - Garima Edoofa: Magdaline as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation.

149 - 16 Jan 2024 07:37PM - +260 760061219: They would end up spending K45,265 that is if converted to my currency
150 - 16 Jan 2024 08:00PM - Garima Edoofa: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
151 - 16 Jan 2024 08:01PM - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
152 - 16 Jan 2024 08:01PM - Garima Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
153 - 16 Jan 2024 08:01PM - Garima Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.  Don‚Äôt you think so?
154 - 16 Jan 2024 08:04PM - +260 760061219: Yes
154 - 16 Jan 2024 08:04PM - +260 760061219: Yes
155 - 16 Jan 2024 08:08PM - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
156 - 16 Jan 2024 08:09PM - Garima Edoofa: Magdaline basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation  If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.  *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).  *Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.  *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
157 - 16 Jan 2024 08:09PM - Garima Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
158 - 16 Jan 2024 08:16PM - +260 760061219: So after taking the A-level test then I will a chance of admission?
159 - 16 Jan 2024 09:00PM - Garima Edoofa: I would like to correct that by A-level result I mean grade 12th result, please.
160 - 16 Jan 2024 09:07PM - +260 760061219: Sorry I misunderstood it
161 - 16 Jan 2024 09:22PM - Garima Edoofa: Magdaline, as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspect of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his finances all by himself (in 80 to 100 words)?
162 - 16 Jan 2024 09:29PM - +260 760061219: Edoofa helps a student on scholarship to pay a less amount which is $2000-$3000 compared to the ordinary amount which is $6000-8000. A student under the Edoofa scholarship pays an admission which is $350 for enrollment, if the student‚Äôs parents or guardians cannot afford to pay the amount given above, the student will be put on the Earn While You Learn program which will enable the student to get credit on the tasks he or she is given and increase the chances of the student being given a higher percentage of scholarship.",No,Yes

I probably would want to know the maximum or total cost before the EWYL is taken into account
239 - 16 Jan 2024 10:44AM - Garima Edoofa: I would want you to go through this message please.
240 - 16 Jan 2024 11:14AM - +263 77 372 2571: I think I now understand it. Enrollment fee is fixed at $350; then cost of education $2000-$3000. So is this the cost of education bracket for a student after EWYL merit? Not less than $2000 but not more than $3000. If you can clarify this for me please
241 - 16 Jan 2024 11:29AM - Garima Edoofa: I would want you to go through this message, please.
242 - 16 Jan 2024 11:45AM - +263 77 372 2571: The way I've just explained above is how I've understood it. I'm focusing on the actual figures, so if I'm wrong you can help me with the correct figs esp. cost of education
243 - 16 Jan 2024 12:13PM - Garima Edoofa: Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year ( if your annual fee is $2000) which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
244 - 16 Jan 2024 12:13PM - Garima Edoofa: I hope you have understood it properly?
245 - 16 Jan 2024 12:23PM - +263 77 372 2571: I think that answers my question to a great extend. If I may ask, what kind of work merits the highest credit for a student
246 - 16 Jan 2024 12:27PM - Garima Edoofa: @263773722571 I would like to tell you there is no limit for earning credit, It totally depends on students how much they can earn, we do have some students who have even earned more than $3000 dollars.

For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
47 - 16 Jan 2024 01:53PM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already.

148 - 15 Jan 2024 03:25PM - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.  I hope you can now realize how we are different isn‚Äôt it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
149 - 15 Jan 2024 09:54PM - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 10 am CAT*.

160 - 16 Jan 2024 12:14PM - Gurvinder: Tim as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn‚Äôt given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
161 - 16 Jan 2024 12:57PM - +263 78 899 6641: $1500
162 - 16 Jan 2024 01:11PM - Gurvinder: Exactly Tim, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.  I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
94 - 15 Jan 2024 09:29PM - +263 71 574 2762: I would like to point out that a lot of countries, including my own, are struggling with problems in their education systems, such as lack of access to quality education, outdated curriculum, and a lack of funding. Based on what I learn from studying abroad, I would like to help address these issues by working with local schools and organizations to implement new, innovative solutions. I would also like to share my experiences and knowledge with others, to help inspire others to pursue a better education system for my country.
95 - 15 Jan 2024 09:30PM - +263 71 574 2762: I am having difficulties accessing the internet due to a lack of electricity, which means I have limited battery power.  this is a common issue where I live, and it is outside of my control.

After reading about all the great opportunities available, I am even more excited about the possibility of pursuing my studies there.

124 - 16 Jan 2024 01:50PM - Gurvinder: So now Lavender, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
125 - 16 Jan 2024 01:52PM - +263 71 574 2762: No I do not have any questions.
126 - 16 Jan 2024 02:01PM - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?

128 - 16 Jan 2024 02:12PM - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
149 - 16 Jan 2024 03:54PM - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
150 - 16 Jan 2024 03:54PM - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.  These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.  *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
151 - 16 Jan 2024 04:13PM - +263 71 574 2762: Thank you for the comprehensive overview of Edoofa's Education for All program. It's clear that you have created a well-rounded program that covers all aspects of a student's journey, from education to professional development. I am particularly interested in the opportunities for professional development. I believe that this program would be an invaluable experience for me.
152 - 16 Jan 2024 04:13PM - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Lavender, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_

120 - 16 Jan 2024 02:08PM - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
121 - 16 Jan 2024 02:08PM - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
122 - 16 Jan 2024 02:08PM - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*",No,Yes

164 - 16 Jan 2024 09:34AM - Gurvinder: So now Mr Mulindi, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
165 - 16 Jan 2024 09:46AM - +260 97 7576833: Good morning again. I now fully understand the important role that Edoofa is playing here. My questions are : 1. Is it possible to take both my children on scholarship of say 80% to 100%? 2. Are there universities offering business and technology courses, for instance, Financial Engeneering? 3. Is there any provision for making Mr and Mrs Mulindi Edoofa ambassadors?
166 - 16 Jan 2024 09:56AM - Gurvinder: To answer your first question, yes any student can get 80% to 100% scholarship, but that will depend on the test and the interview after which everything will be analyzed by the academic board.
167 - 16 Jan 2024 09:58AM - Gurvinder: For the second question, both of your children have got a course which is well pursued and offers a lot of job opportunities for them, based on these factors alone, the courses offered to them are best for their futures, based on the subject they had in grade 12.
168 - 16 Jan 2024 09:59AM - Gurvinder: And for the last question, yes there are provisions for parents becoming Edoofa Ambassadors, but before that may I know, what do you understand by the same(being an Ambassador for Edoofa)? <This message was edited>

180 - 16 Jan 2024 12:44PM - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*.

181 - 16 Jan 2024 12:44PM - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

184 - 16 Jan 2024 12:45PM - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year, but as some courses are niche in nature like *B.Sc. Biochemistry & Bachelor of Pharmacy* itself is a course which has fewer scholarship seats, which is why for you the Annual fee after the scholarship would be between *$2700-$3700*. This cost includes: 1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any) 2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.) 3. Food 4. Accommodation *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
185 - 16 Jan 2024 12:46PM - Gurvinder: *Please note that this is for one student*
186 - 16 Jan 2024 12:46PM - Gurvinder: Mr Mulindi in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!  You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
187 - 16 Jan 2024 12:53PM - +260 97 7576833: I am following keenly. May you elaborate clearly what you mean by the two courses being a ' *niche* '
188 - 16 Jan 2024 01:10PM - Gurvinder: The term ""niche"" is applied to certain courses due to their specialized, unique, and focused nature. B.Sc. Biochemistry and Bachelor of Pharmacy are unequivocally considered niche courses because they demand in-depth knowledge and skills in specific areas‚Äîbiochemistry for B.Sc. Biochemistry and pharmaceuticals for Bachelor of Pharmacy.  Here are the factual reasons why these courses are deemed niche:  Specialized Knowledge: Both Biochemistry and Pharmacy require a high degree of specialized scientific knowledge. Biochemistry centers on the study of chemical processes and substances within living organisms, while Pharmacy is dedicated to the design and dispensing of medications.  Limited Scholarship Seats: The acknowledgment of ""fewer scholarship seats"" affirms the existence of a restricted number of scholarships for these courses. This limitation may stem from factors such as high demand, specific industry needs, or the elevated level of expertise required in these fields.  Higher Costs: The documented annual fee after the scholarship is indeed higher for these niche courses ($2700-$3700) in comparison to the general range of $2000-$3000. This underlines the factual observation that the cost of delivering these specialized programs, encompassing resources, faculty expertise, and facilities, is inherently higher.

100 - 16 Jan 2024 09:30AM - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.  *1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*  The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:  -_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0  -_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
101 - 16 Jan 2024 09:30AM - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*  Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:- -Nigenuis -Skooqs -Success Magazine -TIA Organics
102 - 16 Jan 2024 09:30AM - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*  We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: - _Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*. _How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi* _How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer!_ by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu* _It‚Äôs never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship_ by *Mr. Ronard Kachaje* _Decoding the science of personal branding_ by *Mr, Simon Maingi*

112 - 16 Jan 2024 09:30AM - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.  These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.  *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
113 - 16 Jan 2024 09:57AM - +260 97 3906986: I think seeing that other people have benefited from this I also think I can too benefit from this
114 - 16 Jan 2024 10:12AM - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Phadless, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
115 - 16 Jan 2024 10:18AM - +260 96 9954688: Okey
116 - 16 Jan 2024 10:48AM - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.  I hope you can now realize how we are different isn‚Äôt it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?

153 - 16 Jan 2024 01:51PM - Gurvinder: Phadless as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn‚Äôt given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*

151 - 16 Jan 2024 01:11PM - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.  Are you ready?
152 - 16 Jan 2024 01:14PM - +260 97 3906986: Yes
153 - 16 Jan 2024 01:51PM - Gurvinder: Phadless as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn‚Äôt given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
154 - 16 Jan 2024 01:57PM - +260 96 9954688: $1500-$2250
155 - 16 Jan 2024 01:58PM - +260 97 3906986: $1500-$2250
156 - 16 Jan 2024 02:07PM - Gurvinder: Exactly Phadless, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.

209 - 16 Jan 2024 12:54PM - Gurvinder: Mr Emmanuel, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing ‚Äì just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
210 - 16 Jan 2024 12:54PM - Gurvinder: If I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_

I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.  I hope to get a positive response from you soon.

153 - 16 Jan 2024 09:46AM - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.  *1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*  The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:  -_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0  -_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
154 - 16 Jan 2024 09:46AM - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*  Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:- -Nigenuis -Skooqs -Success Magazine -TIA Organics
155 - 16 Jan 2024 09:46AM - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*  We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: - _Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*. _How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi* _How to be industry ready before graduating?

165 - 16 Jan 2024 09:46AM - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.  These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.  *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*

Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
168 - 16 Jan 2024 10:16AM - +263 78 615 7663: That is amazing that much help would be greatly appreciated
169 - 16 Jan 2024 10:45AM - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

162 - 16 Jan 2024 11:17AM - Kunal: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*  The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student‚Äôs performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing ‚Äì just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
163 - 16 Jan 2024 11:17AM - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -* The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as: *Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0 *Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.  *Recruitment Partners:-* Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:- Nigenuis Skooqs Success Magazine TIA Organics  *Webinars:-* We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: - -Digitalization of Industries: How to Become an all-rounder in the Ever-changing Professional World by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade. -How to Network like a Boss by Ms Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi -How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an Employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu -It‚Äôs Never Too Late to Pursue Your Passion: My Journey from Real Estate to Entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje -Decoding the Science of Personal Branding by Mr, Simon Maingi

178 - 16 Jan 2024 02:55PM - Kunal: Indeed, If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. _This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._  *You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families?

Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.  *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.  *3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world.  *4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships.

131 - 16 Jan 2024 06:54PM - +263 78 514 7410: Can you please tell me about the other requirements
132 - 16 Jan 2024 06:55PM - Kunal: Absolutely, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child‚Äôs eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*  *Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
142 - 16 Jan 2024 07:15PM - +263 78 514 7410: Alright
143 - 16 Jan 2024 07:15PM - Kunal: You can address this
144 - 16 Jan 2024 07:21PM - +263 78 514 7410: Honestly speaking I  think we are at stage 1
145 - 16 Jan 2024 07:32PM - Kunal: Well, We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.  In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.  In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.  Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!  Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.  We are left with 5 and 6. So shall I explain it to you?
146 - 16 Jan 2024 07:33PM - +263 78 514 7410: Yes please
147 - 16 Jan 2024 07:49PM - Kunal: *Step 5:* After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.  August 2025 intake applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.  This registration fee($500-$1000) isn‚Äôt an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year‚Äôs Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
148 - 16 Jan 2024 07:49PM - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.  I hope you are clear with the process.

Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision.

Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.

This ensures that they can follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions they may have. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later. *So, I am making you the group admin, please add your parents/guardians or educational supporters and let me know the names and the relations once done.*

131 - 15 Jan 2024 06:34PM - Pallika Edoofa: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.  However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.  *So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*

This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.  I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.

285 - 16 Jan 2024 10:53AM - Sahil Edoofa: Did your counselor share we only have limited seats left and also did your counselor share the benefits of early application with you ?

287 - 16 Jan 2024 12:12PM - Sahil Edoofa: Rutendo's admission is for August 2025 Intake. Let me share with you for all the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake. Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways  1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:- Having a head start that too of more than 20 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.  Giving you an example, Persistance Muza the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself.  This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.  2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:- Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels.  3,  Having the benefit of the Community:- This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.
288 - 16 Jan 2024 12:20PM - +263 77 577 1256: The only challenge I highlighted is that the dates for paying enrollment fee is the same time I am preparing for A Levelland exam fee. The whole idea is wonderful.

There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-  1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.  2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program.  Or  A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.

Kindly share a bit about yourself, what you do, what is your highest qualification, and what motivates you to support your son ahead for education. Additionally, you can add more about your family like the number of children, details of your spouse, etc.  Could you shed some light on what kind of student do you feel your son is, what are his strengths and weaknesses and how would you describe your child as a person, please?
21 - 16 Jan 2024 11:46AM - +263 77 472 0019: My name is Kwitireni Joe, born on 15 June 1977 in remote areas of Chipinge. I am 45 years old. I come from a humble family of three children who are all grown up. I am the last born. I grew up determined to go to school in order to have a better future. I have none Ordinary Level Certificate attained in 1997 at Ngezi Secondary School in Mhondoro.  I am married to Elizabeth Kwitireni who is 40 years old and we are now staying in Gweru. I am a policeman and having difficulties in paying fees for tertiary education for Kudzai. I have four children, Kudzai being the eldest, followed by Nokutenda who is in Form 1, Kunashe who is in Grade 5 and Kudzwaishe who is one year old.  I am a parent who value education and also believe in that my children should exceed the level of education that I attained as their parent. This means my children will compete with others in the global community to solve community problem to make it safe for us all.  Kudzai Kwitireni is a male student who is obedient and hardworking. He worked hard during the two year program in A Level Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry and he managed 13 points out of the possible 15. His strengths are that he is quiet, does not involve many friends and well behaved which means he can do his work and accomplish tasks to the best of his ability. He is a shy person which may lead him in missing social issues that need one to be at gatherings.
22 - 16 Jan 2024 12:17PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Your commitment to serving as a policeman is truly commendable and deserves high praise. As a member of the law enforcement community, you play a vital role in upholding safety, maintaining order, and protecting the well-being of the community. Your dedication to ensuring the security of others demonstrates a deep sense of responsibility and courage, contributing significantly to the overall welfare of society, Mr. Joe! Kudzai's achievements and qualities are truly commendable, and it's evident that he is an exceptional student with a bright future ahead. His remarkable academic success in A Level Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry, securing 13 points out of 15, speaks volumes about his dedication, hard work, and intellectual prowess. His disciplined and quiet demeanor, combined with his ability to work independently and accomplish tasks to the best of his ability, showcases not only academic excellence but also a strong work ethic. Kudzai's obedience, well-behaved nature, and focused approach set him apart, reflecting his commitment to his studies and personal development. Despite his shy disposition, his achievements demonstrate a resilience and determination that will undoubtedly serve him well in his future endeavors! Could you kindly shed light on the educational background of his siblings, please?
23 - 16 Jan 2024 12:35PM - +263 77 472 0019: Kudzai is the first born, Nokutenda is the second  and she is in Form 1 at Fletcher High as a day schooler, after attaining six units at Grade 7 national exams.

26 - 16 Jan 2024 01:24PM - +263 77 472 0019: Kudzai was a day schooler and his fees at Chaplin High School was USD 120 per term and I am the one responsible.
27 - 16 Jan 2024 01:38PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since pursuing higher education is a significant undertaking that demands both mental and financial support, may I know who will be financially supporting Kudzai's education abroad?

35 - 16 Jan 2024 03:37PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I truly admire your vision, Mr. Joe! Exposure to foreign tertiary education offers numerous advantages. It broadens students' horizons by introducing them to diverse cultures and perspectives, improving language skills, and providing a global outlook. They gain access to world-class academic institutions, form international networks, and develop invaluable personal and professional skills. This experience fosters personal growth, enhances career prospects, and cultivates global citizenship. In essence, studying abroad is a transformative journey that equips students with the knowledge, skills, and perspective needed to thrive in our interconnected world!
36 - 16 Jan 2024 03:37PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly send his O-Level results as well, please?
39 - 16 Jan 2024 04:22PM - +263 77 472 0019: He is interested in the medical area and engineering. He have always wanted to be Neuro Surgeon, a person who deals with the nervous system. He has been inspired by the fact that there are a few of these professionals in the country. If he becomes one, he might be of help to the community. It is not offered here in Zimbabwe and that motivated him to look elsewhere where he may start and maybe become a true reflection of his being.
40 - 16 Jan 2024 04:27PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Noted. Well, Mr. Joe, could you please share why Kudzai didn't pursue Biology in his A level?  I believe it is a very crucial science/ medical subject, isn't it?
41 - 16 Jan 2024 04:55PM - +263 77 472 0019: Sure it is crucial. He did it at O Level and he chose not to do it because of lack of career guidance. When he got a place at Chaplin I was committed at work away from home.
42 - 16 Jan 2024 04:56PM - +263 77 472 0019: He has seen the mistake but still want to pursue that if it's permitted
43 - 16 Jan 2024 04:57PM - +263 77 472 0019: If it is not then he may opt for other degrees where he qualifies

243 - 16 Jan 2024 08:57AM - +263 78 101 2373: Morning
244 - 16 Jan 2024 09:29AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Miracle!
245 - 16 Jan 2024 09:30AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Miracle! May I know which one is your favourite, please?
246 - 16 Jan 2024 09:57AM - +263 78 101 2373: My favorite is affordability through guaranteed schoorships
247 - 16 Jan 2024 10:00AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand that your emphasis is on affordability. So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
248 - 16 Jan 2024 10:08AM - +263 78 101 2373: My family feels that studying abroad is a way to become more independent , self-sufficient,being confident and also is a life-changing experience throughout.Moreover, studying can open up to career opportunities therefore pursuing my academic goals and a way to be more marketable to employers after graduating.
252 - 16 Jan 2024 10:47AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Correct! Moving on, *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student‚Äôs application or they would straightaway reject it.  Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not* And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
253 - 16 Jan 2024 10:47AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.

257 - 16 Jan 2024 12:10PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
258 - 16 Jan 2024 12:12PM - +263 78 101 2373: That's a great way for the fee payment....I really appreciate your concerns.
259 - 16 Jan 2024 12:19PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
260 - 16 Jan 2024 01:07PM - +263 78 101 2373: Well the financial aspects of the program is to offer education to all at an affordable cost and helping student self finance themselves.Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his or her finances by themselves reduces the cost ....from the top page whereby you said  a large sum of money is needed  if you are appyling to 5 universities and on top of that all alone....so that where Edoofa Program steps in and  helps...  This is what l understood from the finances.....you can comment and add on some facts l left out sir
261 - 16 Jan 2024 01:13PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.  *Enrollment fee* The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days  For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350  *Cost of education* The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc!  This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
264 - 16 Jan 2024 01:26PM - +263 78 101 2373: Thank you for the quick and understandable summary
265 - 16 Jan 2024 01:40PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Bravo! We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.  *Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.  *Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.  *Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!  *Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.  We are left with 5 and 6. So shall I explain it to you?
266 - 16 Jan 2024 01:43PM - +263 78 101 2373: Yes you can explain 5 and 6
267 - 16 Jan 2024 01:58PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.  This registration fee($500-$1000) isn‚Äôt an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year‚Äôs Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).  Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$1000) will be able to apply for the visa.

183 - 16 Jan 2024 12:20PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Moreblessings. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
184 - 16 Jan 2024 12:20PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing ‚Äì just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.  The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
185 - 16 Jan 2024 12:20PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: - The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are: Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market.

186 - 16 Jan 2024 12:20PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: - Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:- Nigenuis Skooqs Success Magazine TIA Organics
187 - 16 Jan 2024 12:20PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: - We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: - Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade. How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu It‚Äôs never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
188 - 16 Jan 2024 12:20PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.  These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.  What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
189 - 16 Jan 2024 02:44PM - +27 61 641 4334: Y√†aa it will  be beneficial,it reduces some other cost ,I will be able to support my parents by paying a half of my school fees ,and I will be able to support myself through financially ,on the other hand it helps alot  because I will be able to get an experienced while learning  and having an eye to see how people manage and work in the bussiness so that when I got a chance to be fully employed after finishing my degree it will be very easy ,this EWYL I think it is  best and helpful
190 - 16 Jan 2024 03:02PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1600 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $400 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $40-$60 a month
191 - 16 Jan 2024 03:02PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._  Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
192 - 16 Jan 2024 03:02PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $1600, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $800 in the first semester and $800 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.  Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
193 - 16 Jan 2024 03:02PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.  In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.  A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

223 - 16 Jan 2024 03:12PM - +27 61 641 4334: Ok thank you..yaaa I see this EWYL is the best bcz I will be able to reduce financial pressure on my parents ,and gain some experience and skills
224 - 16 Jan 2024 03:21PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I‚Äôll have to add that I‚Äôm flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!  Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ‚Äã: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.  2. *Employability through practical training* ‚Äã: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
225 - 16 Jan 2024 03:21PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What‚Äôs more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.  4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
226 - 16 Jan 2024 03:21PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
227 - 16 Jan 2024 03:44PM - +27 61 641 4334: All I can say is EWYL is gud for me and my parents,since they are not financially stable it will help us alot by reducing the burden of the cost of my education,I think it will be best for me
228 - 16 Jan 2024 04:02PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand that your emphasis is on affordability and employability. So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
229 - 16 Jan 2024 04:31PM - +27 61 641 4334: As their first born,They want me to achieve something gud  in life and to become more  successful so that I will be able to support them financially in future ,I can see my parents by supporting me in all of these ,they want me to get a good educational facilities by going abroad..so am sure they will be happy if I got the opportunity of going abroad
230 - 16 Jan 2024 04:32PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
231 - 16 Jan 2024 04:33PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be  1) *Application Form*  2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.  3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?

209 - 16 Jan 2024 11:15AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.  This registration fee($500-$1000) isn‚Äôt an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year‚Äôs Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).  Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$1000) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.  I hope you are clear with the process?

She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India.

I had believed writting Biology was the best way forward only to discover later that physics is a mandatory subject to pursue what I want abroad.

With this exclusive Scholarship, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1200-$1800, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc!
266 - 16 Jan 2024 10:10AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
267 - 16 Jan 2024 10:11AM - +263 78 232 5335: Yes it is
268 - 16 Jan 2024 10:18AM - +263 78 232 5335: It's affordable
269 - 16 Jan 2024 10:44AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Vimbiso. Our support doesn't stop there! Edoofa also offers an innovative *Earn While You Learn Program*. This program allows you to further reduce your remaining fees by gaining practical work experience while studying. It not only eases the financial burden but also provides you with valuable skills and industry exposure, enhancing your employability and ensuring a well-rounded education.  With *Edoofa's* exclusive Scholarship and the opportunity to earn while you learn, you can focus on your studies, explore your field of interest, and prepare for a successful career.  So do you want me to guide you about the *Earn while you learn* program in depth?

273 - 16 Jan 2024 10:53AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly elaborate on your concerns, please?
317 - 16 Jan 2024 11:18AM - +263 78 232 5335: Yes l do realize thank you
318 - 16 Jan 2024 11:21AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I‚Äôll have to add that I‚Äôm flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!  Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ‚Äã: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.  2. *Employability through practical training* ‚Äã: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
319 - 16 Jan 2024 11:22AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What‚Äôs more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.  4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
320 - 16 Jan 2024 11:22AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
321 - 16 Jan 2024 11:42AM - +263 78 232 5335: The third one
322 - 16 Jan 2024 12:13PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand that your emphasis is on affordability and employability. So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
323 - 16 Jan 2024 01:03PM - +263 78 232 5335: Oky they will good and honoured seeing their child succiding  internationally
324 - 16 Jan 2024 01:11PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
325 - 16 Jan 2024 01:11PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be  1) *Application Form*  2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.  3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
326 - 16 Jan 2024 01:18PM - +263 78 232 5335: Yes that's true
323 - 16 Jan 2024 01:03PM - +263 78 232 5335: Oky they will good and honoured seeing their child succiding  internationally
324 - 16 Jan 2024 01:11PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that.

328 - 16 Jan 2024 01:37PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student‚Äôs application or they would straightaway reject it.  Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not* And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
329 - 16 Jan 2024 01:37PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
330 - 16 Jan 2024 01:37PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
331 - 16 Jan 2024 01:37PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your  - *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team* - *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities* - *Earn While You Learn Program and training* - *University sessions and interactions* - *A guaranteed scholarship seat* - *Visa Documentation Assistance* - *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
332 - 16 Jan 2024 01:46PM - +263 78 232 5335: $350 which is not part of the fees ??
343 - 16 Jan 2024 02:34PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
344 - 16 Jan 2024 03:39PM - +263 78 232 5335: Oky it the children by providing with different skills which later helps them to cater for their educational system by teaching them the earn while
345 - 16 Jan 2024 03:44PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.  *Enrollment fee* The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days  For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350  *Cost of education* The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc! If you are found eligible for a higher quantum of scholarship, the cost of education will be reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum  This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
346 - 16 Jan 2024 03:44PM - +263 78 232 5335: Sure thank you for this
347 - 16 Jan 2024 03:47PM - +263 78 232 5335: Thank you so much now l have understand much better

350 - 16 Jan 2024 04:15PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Bravo! We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.  *Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.  *Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.  *Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!  *Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.  We are left with 5 and 6. So shall I explain it to you?
351 - 16 Jan 2024 04:15PM - +263 78 232 5335: Yes we have done that also
352 - 16 Jan 2024 04:22PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.  This registration fee($500-$1000) isn‚Äôt an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year‚Äôs Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).  Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$1000) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.  I hope you are clear with the process?",No,Yes

That's how we encouraged Beenzu to go ahead and try her luck....we also thought it wouldn't be so soon to arrange for any costs attached in case of anything...no wonder in one of the interview sessions, I mentioned that we would have money around June July... but because from your understood explanations, we thought maybe we can find money somewhere to enable Beenzu be enrolled but unfortunately we have failed to raise the $100 you said can secure her place in a week's time. We're really grateful for the opportunity you are giving her.... it's just that the time this is coming has found us with financial struggles.",No,Yes

462 - 15 Jan 2024 04:27PM - Shubham Madhwal: Good Day  During your application I thought you were a good student who could use this scholarship platform to upskill herself and make great use of this opportunity in transforming yourself as a leader of tomorrow. So I was just assisting you to the best of my abilities, But I believe you are taking that for granted! I have been nothing but patient and kind with you. And I expect such behaviour from your end too. Since I had the ability to discuss with the board and offer you one additional chance for this scholarship program, I was just doing that. *Since you are not at all eager to move forward you just proved me wrong that I was expecting great things from a student who is not at all serious about such a life-changing opportunity*,  If you wanted to go ahead with the program and if you were serious about the program you could have asked us for an extension or you could have asked us for a partial payment. But you were not concerned about your child's education and did not take it seriously, And yes we will be communicating the same with the Board of Directors and your application will not be accepted for the upcoming years.  *Since we are in touch with all the educational institutions you will be debarred from any other scholarship for the entire year.*
463 - 15 Jan 2024 05:29PM - +263 77 340 3777: We were always serious with our child's education I think its the issue of the enrollment fee which came to us whilst we don't have the amount required at the stipulated date further more during the last counseling session you asked us when we would be done with the fees of Birthwell Chagomoka here and we told you that by end of February or early March. We dont know how best for us to come to a common ground. During the weekend we received a call from another beneficiary of the scholarship program and the person told us that we shouldn't lie to you and we have to be open. We are therefore asking you to give us time that we budget accordingly the situation here is a little tight I hope you will understand us
464 - 15 Jan 2024 05:31PM - +263 77 340 3777: Birthwell is very serious with her education please assist

I‚Äôm applying to do aero space engineering and I choose India well because of the the different methodology used in teaching and because India boasts the world third largest education system,India is a home to highly rated institutions known for their academic excellence and quality of education studying in India is more affordable compared to many renowned institutions world wide. 3) $350 and it is to be paid once you are found eligible for the program.the enrollment fees have to be paid within the 7-day period of receiving this letter.
291 - 16 Jan 2024 11:07AM - Shubham Madhwal: Excellent, Attempt, Let me sum it up for you. So that you are clear with all the information
292 - 16 Jan 2024 11:07AM - Shubham Madhwal: 1.Well Edoofa Scholarship Program is an innovative program initiated by Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. under the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative that solves the problems of Affordability and Employability in Higher Education by enabling students to Earn Scholarship Credits and Learn 21st century job skills. Through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, Edoofians are provided 50-100% scholarships to study their dream courses alongside working on live projects that help them earn scholarship credits. We help African students in self-financing their Education. In short, The Edoofa Program, through the SEELS initiative, is bridging the gap between Financial Aid, College Education and Employability.
293 - 16 Jan 2024 11:07AM - Shubham Madhwal: 2. For the selected students who are able to qualify for the *EDOOFA Program* by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to *$2000-$3000* per year. This cost includes:  1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any) 2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.) 3. Food 4. Accommodation
294 - 16 Jan 2024 11:07AM - Shubham Madhwal: 3. let me tell you dear the *enrollment fee* was $750 but due to this pandemic, we understand the problem faced so we have initiated the relief package so now the cost is reduced to $350 and is to be paid once you are found eligible for the program and then your earn while you learn will start and other parts then you can by your scholarship credits. The enrollment fees have to be paid Within the 7-day period of receiving this letter.
295 - 16 Jan 2024 11:07AM - Shubham Madhwal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
296 - 16 Jan 2024 11:07AM - Shubham Madhwal: I hope you now understand the process better?
