How was your Christmas celebration🎄?

I am so excited to see how you celebrated it with your loved ones and friends, and yes, what all you receive in your gifts🎁?

We will discuss all this in our session on *Monday and Thursday* from *12:00 - 01:30 PM* on the *EWYL Line*.
In our session for today, we will be discussing:
1. Saturday Activity
2. Project updates
(I hope you remember our weekly targets: Either you have to share _5 forms for Community Building projects per week_ OR _1 form for African School Reform project per week_)

This all will be done on the *EWYL Line*, please make sure you follow the daily ritual of saying *'I am a proud edoofian'* every morning.
