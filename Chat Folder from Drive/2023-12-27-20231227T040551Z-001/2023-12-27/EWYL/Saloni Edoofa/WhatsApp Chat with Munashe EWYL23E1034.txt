26/12/23, 2:25 PM - +263 78 307 6096: Concerning the document,my understanding is that the EWYL document is a guideline of the EWYL projects.It consists of the basic skills to achieve your career goals and have a secured future.It consists of two projects the corporate alliances and the African Schools Education Reform Mission.The document tells how to handle the projects and it offers guidelines on how to carry them out.Also,it  tells of the credits awarded after completing each stage of each project and how it has an effect on your annual tuition fee.
26/12/23, 2:28 PM - Saloni Edoofa: This is amazing, you have done it well!
26/12/23, 2:28 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
26/12/23, 2:28 PM - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>

26/12/23, 2:34 PM - +263 78 307 6096: I am done with the process and would like to confirm that I understood the audio profile.
26/12/23, 2:41 PM - +263 78 307 6096: Yes,Ms.Saloni I did
26/12/23, 3:57 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
