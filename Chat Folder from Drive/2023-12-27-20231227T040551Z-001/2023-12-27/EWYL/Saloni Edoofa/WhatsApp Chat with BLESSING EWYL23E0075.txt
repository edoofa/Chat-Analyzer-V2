25/12/23, 8:27 AM - +263 71 590 5125: Good morning Ms Saloni. Merry Christmas to you and all the Edoofa Program leadership.

It was a good experience and I enjoyed being part of the Edoofa family. On a sad note I am no longer able to continue with my programme reason being I am joining my cousin sister in Dubai. She has arranged something for me so l will be living Zim next year in January. It was nice interacting with you I have learnt a lot, you are such lovely people. Me and my family have enjoyed every session and all the magazines from the head of Edoofa Programme they were motivational, eye opening and they gave a wider picture of what i should be inife. Pass my regards to all those who were with me in this journey of becoming a proud Edoofian as we were all looking forward to that. May you continue with the good caring lovely spirit even to the new Edoofians to come. Have a lovely day. Thank you

How are you?
26/12/23, 3:36 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I wish you all the best for the endeavor that you are about to take. But may I know how did you come up with this thought to move with your sister?
26/12/23, 4:27 PM - +263 71 590 5125: Good day Ms Saloni, thank you for the best wishes.  Initially at 16 my passion was to study Culinary Arts. I wished to join Culinary Arts shool by then but I felt I needed to grow whilst at high school because I felt I was too young to live my parents for Dubai because even by then i had an opportunity to go to Dubai to study Culinary  Arts. When I went  for my A level that's when l grew an interest in studying Sociology though deep down my heart l new my interest was in Culinary arts. Few weeks ago my mum took me for psych tests and the results revealed that most careers suitable for me where to do with food, for example a baker, chef and so forth. Finally that's when I decided to go for Culinary Arts which I felt I was more into as compared to Sociology. However Sociology is something I can still pursue later in life, as far as I can remember quotes and teachings I learnt from magazine wrote by CEO and Director Angad Singh  have taught me that the sky is the limit when it comes to studying and that one can also search for  other skills found in them and can still pursue with them. So my greatest remarks goes to him and the whole team. You really made me discover myself. Job well done keep on keep promoting youngsters with their studies. Many thanks once again in our shona language we say "Tatenda". That is to say thank you for your time and concern about my future studies.
