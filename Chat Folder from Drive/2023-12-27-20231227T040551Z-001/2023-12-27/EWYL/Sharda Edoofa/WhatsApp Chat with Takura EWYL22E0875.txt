I hope you are doing well

As we embark on today's session, let me share a motivational thought: *'Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.' - Winston Churchill.* This quote reminds us that every step, be it a triumph or a stumble, is part of our journey.

Now, tell me, how did you celebrate Christmas? I believe celebrations are not just about the festive season but also moments of personal victories and joy. How are you doing, and is there anything you'd like to share about your experiences during the holiday season? Let's explore the path ahead together.

26/12/23, 3:36 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Okay Takura. From next time please ensure you are joining the session in time. So we will resume our session tomorrow onwards from *1:30 PM to 2:30 PM* and your sessions will be held from *Monday to Friday*. 
No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.
As now you are an Edoofian, being punctual should be an inherent trait and I hope that as the clock strikes 8:30, you come for the sessions for your fruitful EWYL Journey.
