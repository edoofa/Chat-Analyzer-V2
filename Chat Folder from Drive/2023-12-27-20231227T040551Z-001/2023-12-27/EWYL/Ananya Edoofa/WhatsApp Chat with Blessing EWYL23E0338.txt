Please excuse me for not being able to connect yesterday. We were celebrating Christmas in our office, and I was occupied with decorating the tree. It went really well!

We do not have our sessions over the weekend, so we can now connect on Tuesday. Monday is a holiday due to Christmas!

How are you doing? How was your Christmas?

I hope you all had the merriest Christmas celebration! 🎄 Due to the festive break, our session on Monday had to be called off. No worries, though – I hope you enjoyed the extra time for the festivities.

To make up for it, let's have a compensatory session *tomorrow at 9:30 am*.
I'm looking forward to catching up with all of you!
