26/12/23, 8:02 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Trish!

Thank you for sharing the form with me. How was your Christmas?
26/12/23, 8:23 AM - +263 77 727 1107: So good mam what about yours
26/12/23, 8:43 AM - Ananya Edoofa: It was amazing! 
So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Monday and Thursday : 9:30 a.m to 11:00 a.m
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
26/12/23, 8:43 AM - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
26/12/23, 8:43 AM - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
26/12/23, 1:27 PM - +263 77 727 1107: Ok mam I'm able to attend the second batch of 1:30 to 2:30
