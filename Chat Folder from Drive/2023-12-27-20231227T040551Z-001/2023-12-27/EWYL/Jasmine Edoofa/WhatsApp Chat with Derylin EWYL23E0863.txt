*Keeping your routine in mind, I've shifted our session timings for a more productive engagement.* 
Since we will meet after a few couple of days so I want you to make the most of your time post-celebrations. *To track your progress, I'm setting a goal for you: submit two applications (Community Building/School Reform Project) by Tuesday*

I would appreciate your acknowledgment of this message and confirmation of your understanding of the *new session timings.*
