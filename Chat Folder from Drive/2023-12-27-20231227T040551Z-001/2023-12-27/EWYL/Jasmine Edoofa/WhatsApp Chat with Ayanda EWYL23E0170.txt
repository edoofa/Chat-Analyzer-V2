26/12/23, 1:33 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good afternoon, Ayanda,_*👋🏼
Before delving into your Christmas celebrations, I'd like to bring your attention to the session timings. 
Considering your hectic schedule, I've made some adjustments to our timetable.

*From now onwards, our sessions will take place from Monday to Friday, spanning from 1:30 pm to 3:30 pm*. Yes, we've extended the session to 2 hours for a more productive interaction. 

So are you excited about the session?
26/12/23, 1:35 PM - +263 77 466 4432: Ok mam . But why did we change from the morning session to the afternoon session
26/12/23, 1:35 PM - +263 77 466 4432: I don't mind doing the afternoon session but why did we change <This message was edited>
26/12/23, 1:37 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: My dear, initially, I could only allocate one hour in the morning. However, due to the considerable lag compared to other students, I sensed the necessity of prolonging the session to 2 hours. This adjustment aims to ensure that we cover more ground during our sessions.

26/12/23, 2:54 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
26/12/23, 2:54 PM - +263 77 466 4432: Yes i do
26/12/23, 2:56 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
26/12/23, 2:58 PM - +263 77 466 4432: I did and am still waiting for his response
26/12/23, 3:00 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
26/12/23, 3:00 PM - +263 77 466 4432: Ok mam
26/12/23, 3:01 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_

I hope this message finds you well. Allow me to introduce myself as a student of your esteemed institution. I am writing to share some exciting news.
I have been honored with the privilege of being selected for the Edoofa scholarship program. Through this incredible opportunity, I have been granted the chance to pursue my higher education in India, and what makes it even more remarkable is that this scholarship covers 50-100% of my educational expenses.
26/12/23, 3:02 PM - +263 77 466 4432: Ok
26/12/23, 3:07 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this further with you. Could you please let me know when it would be convenient for you to connect via WhatsApp?
26/12/23, 3:55 PM - +263 77 466 4432: I will be asking the head???
26/12/23, 9:31 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, I will let you know on how to do this
26/12/23, 9:31 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: So now it is time to wrap up the session. It was lovely talking to you.
