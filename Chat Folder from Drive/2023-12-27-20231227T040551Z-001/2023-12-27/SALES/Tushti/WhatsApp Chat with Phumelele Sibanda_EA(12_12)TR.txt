18/12/23, 3:27 pm - Tushti: Hi, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.

22/12/23, 10:03 am - Tushti: Alright so Shayne, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction. In about a 100 words, please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself: your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background. Also do share the following details:

1. Your educational level
2. The course you would like to study and why
3. What do your parents do (their profession)
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
6. Who has been financially supporting you for your Education so far
7. Who will be financially supporting your higher education abroad
8.   How much was your per-term fee in school as well as in University in $?
22/12/23, 11:46 am - +263 77 727 0974: 1. Bachelor’s degree 
2. Climate charge / GIS 
3. None
4. Form 3
5. yes studying 
6. My parents 
7. None 
8. High school $50 tertiary $700
22/12/23, 11:55 am - Tushti: I did not understand answer 7
22/12/23, 11:56 am - Tushti: How would you pay the tuition fee? As you know, the scholarship would reduce the fee amount significantly, but some amount would have to be paid
22/12/23, 11:58 am - +263 77 727 0974: I've no idea on how your scholarship works I thought it's a full funded one
22/12/23, 12:00 pm - Tushti: Shayne, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
22/12/23, 12:06 pm - +263 77 727 0974: Ok i get you, so you are offering scholarships?
22/12/23, 12:12 pm - Tushti: That's right
22/12/23, 12:13 pm - Tushti: So, I would like to understand how you shall be able to sponsor your education
22/12/23, 12:29 pm - +263 77 727 0974: As of me I'm financial unstable
22/12/23, 12:29 pm - Tushti: Would your parents be able to support you?
22/12/23, 12:47 pm - +263 77 727 0974: Lemme confirm I'll get back to you. But I would like to know the amount needed per term.
22/12/23, 12:48 pm - Tushti: The annual cost of education after scholarship could be around $2000-3000
22/12/23, 12:50 pm - +263 77 727 0974: Including accommodation?
22/12/23, 1:08 pm - Tushti: Yes
22/12/23, 1:16 pm - +263 77 727 0974: So how much will scholarship cover
22/12/23, 1:23 pm - Tushti: That depends on your scholarship percentage, it can be anywhere from 50-100%
22/12/23, 3:54 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
