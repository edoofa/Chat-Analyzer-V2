16/12/23, 10:43 am - Tushti: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher  education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
16/12/23, 10:46 am - +263 78 109 9698: It is what l want
16/12/23, 10:56 am - Tushti: Alright so Belinda, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction. In about a 100 words, please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself: your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background. Also do share the following details:

1. Your current educational level (O Level/ L5/ U6) and subject combination
2. The course you would like to study and why
3. What do your parents do (their profession)
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
6. Who has been financially supporting you for your Education so far
7. Who will be financially supporting your higher education abroad
8.  How much was your per-term fee in school in $?
9. Name of your school and the province in which it is located
16/12/23, 11:07 am - +263 78 109 9698: My name is Belinda MARUFU .I'm the the first born child in a family of three girls.I attended my secondary education at Kwekwe High School in Kwekwe, Midlands Province in Zimbabwe. I wrote 10 subjects at O'level and l passed 7 of them with 5Bs and 2Cs. Then l went to further my studies at the same school and l wrote 3 subjects namely Statistics, Geography and Crop Science this year .I would like to study  a course in agriculture mainly Agribusiness or Agronomist.My father is a foreman whilst my mother is a housewife but mainly focuses on agriculture for family consumption.Both my parents' highest level of education is O'level.My father was supporting me for my education so far and hence continue to do so in the Future as well as abroad.The school fees per term was ranged at 100US per term
16/12/23, 11:51 am - Tushti: Thank you dear
16/12/23, 11:51 am - Tushti: Now, you mentioned you have younger siblings in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for your family to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are they facing such a situation?
16/12/23, 12:07 pm - +263 78 109 9698: We are struggling to pay the fees each term
16/12/23, 12:13 pm - Tushti: In that case, how would the family manage the finances involved in your higher education abroad?
16/12/23, 12:13 pm - Tushti: I would like the parent to come online and answer
16/12/23, 12:18 pm - +263 77 633 3898: Ma'am we are  highly looking for a  scholarship or a bursary so that it can assist us a little bit rest we  can settle for payment plan
16/12/23, 12:27 pm - Tushti: @263776333898 let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
16/12/23, 12:35 pm - +263 77 633 3898: Olkae I understand that thank you
16/12/23, 12:36 pm - +263 77 633 3898: So your scholarships only focuses on abroad universities
16/12/23, 1:12 pm - Tushti: Yes
16/12/23, 1:13 pm - Tushti: So, do you wish to continue the application or withdraw it?
16/12/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 109 9698: We will continue
16/12/23, 4:37 pm - Tushti: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on *Monday at 9:30 am* Please be online during your session time!

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.
