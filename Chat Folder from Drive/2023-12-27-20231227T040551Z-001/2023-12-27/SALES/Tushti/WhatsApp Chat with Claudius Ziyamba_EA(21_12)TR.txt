23/12/23, 10:13 am - +263 77 622 8473: Hello my name is Claudius Ziyamba a young man aged 18 last born of four children ,currently studying Pure Mathematics, Chemistry and Physics at Mt Selinda High School in Manicaland Province with my final high school year (Upper 6) being in 2024. 

After completing my studies hopefully wth flying colours i would like to pursue a degree in Aeronautical Engineering as i have always been fascinated by the science behind aeronautics.

I would say My weakness is not achieving a goal i set for myself and my strength is socialisation as i can interact exceptionally well with people around me .

Mother : nurse : diploma in general nursing and midwifery
Father : teacher : diploma in teaching 

My mother currently pays for my school fees which is USD 385 but really stuggles to pay for it due to the current economic challenges in the country and also has to pay for my other siblings' university fees 

My first born sister is doing her final year in chemical engineering. 

My second born sister is doin her third year in a S.H.E degree .

My third born brother is doing his attchment for his Accounting degree. 

My mother and my sister will be supporting me for my education abroad given that she gets a job by the time i start my higher education.

 
I like reading novels and i do public speaking and debate at school
23/12/23, 10:18 am - Tushti: I hope the mother and sister both are added to this group?
23/12/23, 10:18 am - Tushti: If not, add them

Which is apoun completion of the dgree ....i plan to further my studies and learn more specifically about space technologies as my country zimbabwe is not quite at the forefront of this sector in the continent and world . I would like to further my knowledge by interning in the united states in big companies such as space x which has made significant strides in terms of space technology....if such an opportunity is given i would also the like to facelift the state of my nation in terms of space tech ... Zimbabwe has quite a big problem in network and internet connection which i have experienced first hand in the sense that it does not have satellites in orbit...This being my major aim i would also like to explore the universe as i always dreamed of as a child and discover the unknown for the betterment of mankind
26/12/23, 12:24 pm - +263 77 622 8473: The edoofa programme would play a pivotal role as it will not only facilitate my financial needs but also facilitate the provision of crucial resources and exposure....and amoung other things it would also allow me to interact with other people from diverse nationalities and cultures
