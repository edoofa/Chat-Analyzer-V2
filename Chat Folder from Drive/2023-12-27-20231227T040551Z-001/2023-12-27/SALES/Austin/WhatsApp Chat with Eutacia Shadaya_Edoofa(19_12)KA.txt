19/12/23, 12:07 pm - Kunal: Thank you for sharing
I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about Eutacia achieving it
19/12/23, 12:10 pm - +263 77 381 8114: I'm very confident she can make it
19/12/23, 12:16 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
19/12/23, 12:16 pm - Kunal: Based on my evaluation, considering her subjects and passion for computers, she is eligible for

20/12/23, 5:09 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 9:41 am - Kunal: Good Morning,

*"Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going." - Sam Levenson*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
21/12/23, 10:06 am - +263 77 381 8114: Yes we can start
21/12/23, 10:16 am - Kunal: It is good to hear from you
21/12/23, 10:16 am - Kunal: So, can you now tell me? 

How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your child’s career?
21/12/23, 10:26 am - +263 77 381 8114: Because India has a growing technology sector so there are many opportunities for those with right skills and is also known for its innovation and creativity so it's a great place to learn and grow as a Software engineer
21/12/23, 10:36 am - Kunal: Indeed, I believe your child would learn a lot from the exposures offered if found eligible and works hard to achieve the dreams. Moving ahead, by any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
21/12/23, 10:44 am - +263 77 381 8114: I guess it ranges from $3000 to $8000
21/12/23, 10:49 am - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
21/12/23, 10:50 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 11:21 am - +263 77 381 8114: Yes it's affordable
21/12/23, 11:32 am - Kunal: Good to hear that
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.
And do you know how that is done?
21/12/23, 12:06 pm - +263 77 381 8114: No I don't know please share
21/12/23, 12:48 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the 

*Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
21/12/23, 12:48 pm - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
21/12/23, 12:48 pm - Kunal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
21/12/23, 12:48 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
21/12/23, 12:48 pm - Kunal: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
21/12/23, 12:48 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 12:48 pm - Kunal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
21/12/23, 12:48 pm - Kunal: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
21/12/23, 1:10 pm - +263 77 381 8114: I think it will benefit her because she will be creating social networks
21/12/23, 1:11 pm - Kunal: Indeed
If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
21/12/23, 1:15 pm - +263 77 381 8114: Okay thank you
21/12/23, 1:16 pm - Kunal: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
21/12/23, 1:16 pm - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
21/12/23, 1:16 pm - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
21/12/23, 1:16 pm - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different.
Let me know which point out of 4 you like the most
21/12/23, 1:21 pm - +263 77 381 8114: 3. Earn while you learn
21/12/23, 1:30 pm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and employability.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

21/12/23, 1:30 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
21/12/23, 1:43 pm - +263 77 381 8114: Noone hopefully she will get a 100% scholarship
21/12/23, 2:10 pm - Kunal: As you know,Edoofa Scholarship Program offers 50-100% scholarship on tuition fees. The remaining cost after scholarship and cost of Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family

If found eligible,are you in a position to raise them?
21/12/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 381 8114: Yes I am
21/12/23, 2:42 pm - Kunal: That is completely understandable
So how do you feel about your child studying abroad?
21/12/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 381 8114: Truth be told it's scary especially because of the fact that she is not familiar with the place and doesn't know anyone that side

But l want her to persue  her studies so I will be fine and yeah l taught her good principles that l hope she will not abandon when she finally goes that side
21/12/23, 2:50 pm - Kunal: I can understand your worry, Mr Ngoni
Studying Internationally would make her career advance at even a greater pace, as she will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job which would actually help in uplifting your family and provide a peaceful and hassle free life.
21/12/23, 2:50 pm - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
21/12/23, 3:12 pm - +263 77 381 8114: I think some universities would require in Visa , proof of financial support, criminal backgrounds check and health insurance
21/12/23, 3:12 pm - Kunal: Indeed
21/12/23, 3:12 pm - Kunal: .*When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
21/12/23, 3:12 pm - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
21/12/23, 3:12 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 381 8114: Okay okay
21/12/23, 3:35 pm - Kunal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
21/12/23, 3:35 pm - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
The Foster and Care throughout your course
21/12/23, 3:35 pm - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
21/12/23, 5:04 pm - Kunal: Are we connected?
21/12/23, 5:28 pm - +263 77 381 8114: Yes we are
21/12/23, 5:29 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 5:32 pm - +263 77 381 8114: Stage 6
21/12/23, 5:33 pm - Kunal: That is right.We had very well covered till the Acceptance Letter and Enrollment formalities which is in stage 4.Even though we had mentioned stages 5 and 6 briefly we are left with some more information from the last two stages
So shall I explain it to you
21/12/23, 5:34 pm - +263 77 381 8114: You can explain
21/12/23, 5:34 pm - Kunal: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
21/12/23, 5:34 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.


I hope you are clear with the process
21/12/23, 5:43 pm - +263 77 381 8114: Yeah it's clear but wanted to ask in terms on Visa do we pay for it
21/12/23, 6:01 pm - Kunal: Visa fee:-$83 is to be borne by the student* which is mostly a one-time investment.
21/12/23, 6:02 pm - Kunal: We have come to the end of your counseling session, now before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
21/12/23, 6:02 pm - Kunal: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*
21/12/23, 6:02 pm - Kunal: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experience

Furthermore, if you have any other query I would suggest that you note down all of the questions and get back to me
21/12/23, 6:02 pm - Kunal: Also, I am sharing some pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program

*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*
Congratulations on clearing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program I hope you had a great session with Mr Kunal and learned about the program better. Now, I will be guiding you ahead to the Eligibility check stage after addressing your questions. 

Are you ready for the same?
22/12/23, 12:19 pm - +263 71 682 6059: Yes thank you
22/12/23, 12:21 pm - Austin: It is good to connect with you today, Eutacia

I hope you are doing well
22/12/23, 12:21 pm - Austin: May I know did you managed to discuss the Edoofa Program with your family, please?
22/12/23, 12:23 pm - +263 71 682 6059: Yes I managed
22/12/23, 12:24 pm - Austin: So may I know what all discussions you had with your family with regard to the Edoofa Scholarship Program? You can share a summary and their thoughts after getting to know the program well.
22/12/23, 12:39 pm - +263 71 682 6059: When we started discussing  about Edoofa programme my family paid attention to me everything went smoothly until I asked if any of them had an objection that's were the problem started my siblings thought that it a waste of money and time go to university a road whilst we have universities in our country then I started to tell them reasons of studying abroad which include experience new perspectives ,how to navigate different cultures also work with dirvese peers ,improve critical thinking and work opportunities
My other sibling was worried about my safety and I told her that Edoofa has been trusted for years and one my sisters friend went to India through Edoofa scholarship programme
22/12/23, 12:54 pm - Austin: Excellent, well it seems that you took your family through our entire conversation which we did during your counselling session!
22/12/23, 12:55 pm - Austin: Addressing the first concern, did you manage to compare the cost of education in Zimbabwe with that through the Edoofa Scholarship Program?
22/12/23, 1:15 pm - +263 71 682 6059: Zimbabwe's cost of education is a bit cheaper compared to Edoofa Scholarship  Program but in actually fact it will cost us later on in life because their education system is not standard compared to that of Edoofa.

You went to school but when you are asked about what you learnt you can not express it practically you don't know anything.

From my researches Edoofa Program enables you to practice what you learnt in real life
22/12/23, 1:18 pm - Austin: Well Eutacia,Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months this year and let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
22/12/23, 1:18 pm - Austin: At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self-sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program. We also ensure they develop employability skills so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate. I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?
22/12/23, 1:21 pm - +263 71 682 6059: Yes I am
22/12/23, 1:27 pm - Austin: Good to hear that, do you know the name of your sisters friend who came this side through the program? <This message was edited>
22/12/23, 1:32 pm - +263 71 682 6059: Yes Anna Magoge
22/12/23, 1:36 pm - Austin: That is a great news, Anna is a former student of Chibuwe High, one of our associate schools in Zimbabwe.

22/12/23, 1:39 pm - Austin: *A total of 370+ Edoofians from Zimbabwe were welcomed at the airport by our Edoofa team for this year's intake*. The numerous testimonials from countless students serve as a powerful testament to the effectiveness of this opportunity in enhancing students' employability skills, and overall education quality. Let me proudly inform you that we have *Randy Cleopatra Yule, a former student of your current A-level school who arrived recently for the intake* and many more students from the A-level batch have qualified for the upcoming intakes. The opportunity has now been opened for you and do you know her as your senior?
22/12/23, 1:49 pm - +263 71 682 6059: I do not really know her
I went to to First Choice Private School this year for my lower six
22/12/23, 2:08 pm - Austin: Alright Eutacia!
22/12/23, 2:08 pm - Austin: Is your family having any questions for me as of now?
22/12/23, 2:44 pm - +263 71 682 6059: They are asking that let's say she's accepted will she  be coming home for vacations
22/12/23, 3:03 pm - Austin: Students usually look forward to settling down and making sure education is not hampered.So they learn and do internships at breaks.But still students can definitely visit their family during holidays and spend time with them.
22/12/23, 4:04 pm - +263 71 682 6059: It's okay thank you so much

The percentage of scholarship is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa

So the Universites will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of scholarship
