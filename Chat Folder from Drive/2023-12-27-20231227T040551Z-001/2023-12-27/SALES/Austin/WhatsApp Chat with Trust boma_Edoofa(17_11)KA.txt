In my tertiary education I would like to study pharmacy. This is because I've always loved biology and chemistry as subjects and my passion is to help my country and others to deal with different ailments through pharmaceuticals .

My parents are both working class people. My mom is a nurse and my dad is an entrepreneur. My mom has a masters of science in nursing and midwifery . My dad has a diploma in business administration.


I have 1 sibling who is in primary school. He suffers from autism 

My finances have been covered by my parents so far and they will continue to do so for my tertiary education although they find it difficult. 

Back then my school fees amounted to $228.73 per-term that is without groceries and pocket money.

At school I was the head prefect in my senior years of secondary school. I was also the programs coordinator for the English drama club. I have a clean record with no suspension or expulsion. I Will send the headteacher's contact for reference.

At school I would volunteer to care for the laboratory because I was interested in lab work. I took my time to learn about chemicals and lab safety. It it my passion to study pharmacy.

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.

This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*

If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
17/11/23, 4:57 pm - +265 986 69 00 33: Yah this is nice. It could help very much
17/11/23, 4:58 pm - Kunal: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
17/11/23, 4:58 pm - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
17/11/23, 4:58 pm - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
17/11/23, 4:58 pm - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different.
Let me know which point out of 4 you like the most
17/11/23, 5:02 pm - +265 986 69 00 33: Number 2.affordability is the greatest issue me and my parents though about. Am very glad that the program tackles this issue
17/11/23, 5:02 pm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and maximum exposures
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.
17/11/23, 5:03 pm - +265 986 69 00 33: Sure

17/11/23, 5:03 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
17/11/23, 5:08 pm - +265 986 69 00 33: My parents
17/11/23, 5:10 pm - Kunal: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
17/11/23, 5:13 pm - +265 986 69 00 33: They are generally excited. They believe it is a chance for me to Excel in my education.
17/11/23, 5:14 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at even a greater pace, as you will be transformed to a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family thereby yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle free life to your parents.
17/11/23, 5:14 pm - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
17/11/23, 5:17 pm - +265 986 69 00 33: Am not familiar with the process
17/11/23, 5:18 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you that these are required
17/11/23, 5:18 pm - Kunal: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
17/11/23, 5:18 pm - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.

*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

Are you ready for the same?
18/11/23, 12:50 pm - +265 986 69 00 33: Greetings Mr Austin. Yes I am ready.
18/11/23, 12:52 pm - Austin: It is good to connect with you today, Trust

I hope you are doing well
18/11/23, 12:52 pm - Austin: May I know did you managed to discuss the Edoofa Program with your family, please?
18/11/23, 12:53 pm - +265 986 69 00 33: Yes we talked about it
18/11/23, 12:54 pm - Austin: great, So may I know what all discussions you had with your family with regard to the Edoofa Scholarship Program? You can share a summary and their thoughts after getting to know the program well.
18/11/23, 12:58 pm - +265 986 69 00 33: Sure
18/11/23, 1:05 pm - +265 986 69 00 33: We talked about the program and how it is such a grand opportunity.

We especially loved the earn while you learn program. We think that considering our finances, earning scholarship credits makes tertiary education more affordable to us.

We also loved the fact that counselors are assigned to students hence the student doesn't lose track of their goals.

My parents are definitely interested and would like to proceed with the program.

I think this is all
18/11/23, 1:07 pm - Austin: Excellent, well it seems that you took your family through our entire conversation which we did during your counselling session! 

I am glad your family understands this opportunity's importance and the power to transform your career. So may I know if your family has any queries, please
18/11/23, 1:13 pm - +265 986 69 00 33: Yes. They would like to know whether EDOOFA has special schools where students are enrolled or should we have to find a school ourselves
18/11/23, 1:21 pm - Austin: Our parent organization has worked with 250+ reputed Universities and Colleges in India. For your research and learnings let me share with you the details of some of our associate Universities

*Lovely Professional University* 

*Galgotias University* 

*MVN University* 

*Quest Group of Institutions*

*Gulzar Group of Institutes(GGI)* 

*Colleges under Punjab Technical University* 

You will go through University sessions after which you will be receiving offer letters from different reputed Universities and will have the liberty to choose your University.
18/11/23, 1:22 pm - +265 986 69 00 33: Okay
18/11/23, 1:31 pm - Austin: What else would you like to ask me please?
18/11/23, 1:38 pm - +265 986 69 00 33: Does the scholarship include living expenses
18/11/23, 1:39 pm - Austin: The cost of education after the Edoofa program discussed during the session includes your cost of tuition, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc
18/11/23, 1:53 pm - +265 986 69 00 33: Okay I think that's all the questions
18/11/23, 1:53 pm - Austin: That is fine, 

So may I know the thoughts and opinions of your family regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
18/11/23, 1:58 pm - +265 986 69 00 33: They think with 50% scholarship the cost will still be a Hustle especially due to the economic Crisis in Malawi. This can be reduced by the EWYL but they will see what they can do. Overall they have no objections.


Although they would like to know whether the fee is paid before selection or after
18/11/23, 2:10 pm - Austin: This is well noted and I appreciate your family's willingness to invest in your career!
18/11/23, 2:11 pm - Austin: The enrollment fee is supposed to be paid only if you qualify
18/11/23, 2:11 pm - +265 986 69 00 33: Okay
18/11/23, 2:14 pm - Austin: So, before we move  to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

This program also equips students with work experience which will prove essential in the workforce . The EARN WHILE YOU LEARN also doesn't put a limit on how many credits one earns hence a student can reduce their fee more.

23/11/23, 11:45 am - Austin: Noted Trust, you can visit your bank branch in Malawi to fill out and submit the telegraphic transfer form and the bank will process the transaction in 2-4 days. Since there is a shortage of forex in Malawi, I encourage students to proceed with the enrollment soon so that the due dates are not missed. You can send a picture of the stamped form and once the payment is successful you will receive the SWIFT receipt from the bank
