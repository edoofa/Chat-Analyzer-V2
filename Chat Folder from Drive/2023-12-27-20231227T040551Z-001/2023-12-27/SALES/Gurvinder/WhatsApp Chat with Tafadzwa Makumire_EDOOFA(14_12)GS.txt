14/12/23, 12:43 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
14/12/23, 12:43 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
14/12/23, 12:43 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
14/12/23, 12:44 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
14/12/23, 7:51 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*.

I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.

18/12/23, 5:53 pm - Gurvinder: Mr Makumire, the course will be offered on the basis if the student's interest, his subjects, and the counselling session.
18/12/23, 5:53 pm - Gurvinder: So can you please address this.
18/12/23, 6:00 pm - +263 77 318 6828: so need to counsel me first
18/12/23, 6:05 pm - Gurvinder: In this counselling session, the goal is to give you clarity about the program, and guide your child to an Accessible, Affordable, and Employable education, so in order to proceed ahead, please address this.
18/12/23, 6:06 pm - +263 77 318 6828: ok air noted  i think its a recommendable to have this session its crual ,we can proceed for sure
18/12/23, 6:09 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Mr Makumire, as we start your son's counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
18/12/23, 6:11 pm - +263 77 318 6828: yes sir
18/12/23, 6:12 pm - Gurvinder: So is @263774215042 active?
18/12/23, 6:13 pm - +263 77 318 6828: yes
18/12/23, 6:14 pm - Gurvinder: Now @263774215042, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?

How are you?
19/12/23, 9:23 am - +263 77 318 6828: good morning mr Gurvinder,
19/12/23, 10:04 am - Gurvinder: As much as I'd love to offer a pilot aviation course through the Edoofa program, it's important to note that the availability of courses under a scholarship program like Edoofa can be influenced by various factors.

Aviation courses, especially pilot training, come with exceptionally high costs due to the specialised training, equipment, and flight hours required. Often, scholarship programs like Edoofa focus on more traditional academic courses due to their broader applicability and feasibility within their budgetary constraints.

The expenses associated with aviation courses, particularly pilot training, can surpass the scholarship resources. Additionally, these courses might have specific requirements or certifications that extend beyond the scope of what the scholarship program can offer.

However, if you would like to go ahead with the counselling session, I would love to offer you an Academic course.
19/12/23, 7:01 pm - +263 77 318 6828: ok noted sir,,,so what other sponsorship acardemic courses do you offer ?
19/12/23, 8:37 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*.
