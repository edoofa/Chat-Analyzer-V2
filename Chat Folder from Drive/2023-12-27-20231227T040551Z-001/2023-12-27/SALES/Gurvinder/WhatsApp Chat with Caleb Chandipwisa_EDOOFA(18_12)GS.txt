18/12/23, 2:29 pm - Gurvinder: Good Afternoon Caleb, Mrs Chandipwisa!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
18/12/23, 2:52 pm - +263 71 349 0117: Good Afternoon to you, thank you for contacting me Caleb Chandipwisa
18/12/23, 2:56 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Caleb,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
18/12/23, 2:59 pm - +263 71 349 0117: Thank you Mr Gurvinder
18/12/23, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Caleb, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Salma, is that correct?
18/12/23, 3:07 pm - +263 71 349 0117: Yes Mr Gurvinder, she is the one who introduced me.
18/12/23, 3:16 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Salma, also do tell me whether you learnt about Salma’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
18/12/23, 5:37 pm - +263 71 349 0117: sorry for the late reply. Sometimes I am facing network challenges
18/12/23, 5:37 pm - +263 71 349 0117: She told me that you offer scholarships to African students and Earn While You Learn programme .
18/12/23, 5:41 pm - Gurvinder: Yes that is correct, let me brief you more about the program.
18/12/23, 5:41 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
18/12/23, 5:41 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
18/12/23, 5:41 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
18/12/23, 5:41 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
18/12/23, 5:45 pm - +263 71 349 0117: That is correct Mr Gurvinder.
18/12/23, 5:59 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Caleb, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
18/12/23, 6:28 pm - +263 71 349 0117: Yes , I believe so.
18/12/23, 6:33 pm - Gurvinder: Now Caleb, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

20/12/23, 12:21 pm - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study Crop Science
, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
20/12/23, 1:47 pm - +263 71 349 0117: Since agriculture is the foundation of our economy, I have always had a strong interest for it. The famine experienced by the majority of African nations due to crop failure served as fuel for this. My curiosity about how crops are studied to prevent hunger and poverty is strong.
20/12/23, 1:59 pm - Gurvinder: Your motivation to study Crop Science, particularly in the context of addressing agricultural challenges in African nations, is incredibly important.
20/12/23, 1:59 pm - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
20/12/23, 2:21 pm - +263 71 349 0117: Although I have family members in the broader subject of agriculture, there aren't really any people in my family or circles that have studied crop science specifically.
20/12/23, 2:29 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
20/12/23, 2:30 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share your O Level and Diploma results for evaluation?

21/12/23, 8:56 am - +263 77 322 0135: Good morning, encouraging words. Thank you
21/12/23, 8:57 am - +263 71 349 0117: Thank you for the wise words.
21/12/23, 10:19 am - Gurvinder: So let us continue the session now.
21/12/23, 10:20 am - Gurvinder: Caleb, may I know the reason behind doing a Diploma and not pursuing A level?
21/12/23, 10:45 am - +263 71 349 0117: Instead of going to A level where it's just theory, someone can learn additional techniques with a diploma in agriculture. Hence, it was necessary for me to have both theoretical and practical knowledge.
21/12/23, 12:25 pm - Gurvinder: Caleb, due to the fact that you did a diploma, I want to offer you *BSc Biotechnology* over other courses for crop science offers several unique advantages:

Interdisciplinary Approach: Biotechnology encompasses a range of scientific disciplines like biology, chemistry, genetics, and engineering. This interdisciplinary nature allows students to gain a comprehensive understanding of crop science while integrating technological advancements.

Advanced Techniques: Biotechnology equips students with cutting-edge techniques used in crop improvement, such as genetic engineering, tissue culture, and molecular breeding. These methods are crucial in developing more resilient, disease-resistant, and higher-yielding crops.

Impact on Agriculture: Biotechnology plays a pivotal role in addressing global agricultural challenges, including food security, climate change adaptation, and sustainable farming practices. Students in this field have the potential to make substantial contributions to improving agricultural productivity and sustainability.

Research Opportunities: BSc in Biotechnology offers ample opportunities for research and practical applications. Students can engage in hands-on lab work, experiments, and field trials, gaining valuable experience in applying theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios.

Career Prospects: Biotechnology graduates have diverse career options in both agricultural and non-agricultural sectors. They can work in research institutions, biotech companies, government agencies, or pursue further studies in specialized areas.

Adaptability: Biotechnology skills are transferable across various industries beyond agriculture, providing flexibility in career choices and professional growth.
21/12/23, 1:04 pm - +263 71 349 0117: Thank you for the offer, Sir. It will be a fantastic chance that will help me advance my career significantly.
21/12/23, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
21/12/23, 7:30 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.

“Teachers can open the door, but you must enter it yourself.”
Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
22/12/23, 8:45 am - +263 71 349 0117: Good morning Sir, I am sorry about yesterday I experienced network challenges.
22/12/23, 8:46 am - +263 71 349 0117: In 5 years after completion I would like to give back to my country to boost productivity and help to reduce hunger and poverty through sustainable farming practises that will result in improved pest control and draught challenges 

Since biotechnology skills can be applied in various industries, I see myself volunteering to partner with various organizations which are advocating for reducing hunger and poverty so as coming up with ways that may assist Africa as a region in improving food security and also to preserve and store harvested food thereby reducing imports.

I would also see myself contributing immensely in the research companies or the government trying to develop the best ways to be more productive like researching on the ways to produce crops that will give higher yields, crops that can resist or tolerate diseases so that we will be very productive

Furthermore, I would also want to play part in various industries such as engineering since biotechnology involves a lot of disciplines that may be useful in this Zimbabwe to assist and finding solutions to the challenges that maybe face in the future that may include storage houses which are computerized

Since technology improves daily I would want to see myself staying relevant in this field. I will be doing the continuous career development because I want to be always up to date with the current affairs.

I also see myself as an educator. My wish is to inspire young generation of agricultural farmer and scientists about the best ways we can do   farming with the knowledge we would have acquired.

Growing up in a country that was failing to attain food security due to droughts, pest challenges, diseases, lack of knowledge. My vision was to ensure that the community attains food security and evade poverty. I see this program giving me an opportunity to attain my vision that I had about my community and career development wise.
22/12/23, 2:00 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but I am under the weather today, so I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10 AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
22/12/23, 2:17 pm - +263 71 349 0117: thank you Sir, I will be available

Encouraging words. Thank you
23/12/23, 9:41 am - Gurvinder: That is really great Caleb I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
23/12/23, 10:00 am - +263 71 349 0117: yes Sir, I am willing.
23/12/23, 10:25 am - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
23/12/23, 11:16 am - +263 71 349 0117: Studying abroad affords me an opportunity to have hands-on experience from other countries that I feel are far ahead of us in terms of technology. It also gives me exposure to learning new methods and culture. It is also a chance for me to share and market our culture and how we implement our homegrown methods.
23/12/23, 11:51 am - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
23/12/23, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>

26/12/23, 8:50 am - +263 71 349 0117: Good morning Sir, I will definately be available today. Here sometime I face a lot of network challenges but I will try my level best.
26/12/23, 8:52 am - +263 71 349 0117: I will impart the knowledge I have learnt from a variety of sources, including details regarding international educational systems. My main goal is to help as much as I can and share information.

I will offer current details on international developments, policies, and practices in education. This can assist educators and policymakers in understanding effective strategies and customizing them to local contexts.

I will give suggestions based on current research and best practices. This will help in the revision of the educational curriculum. This will ensure that the curriculum meets students' evolving needs while still being in line with international standards.

I will participate in professional development and teacher training by offering lesson ideas and techniques. Teachers might become more proficient and knowledgeable by exchanging successful teaching techniques
26/12/23, 9:11 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
26/12/23, 9:11 am - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Caleb, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
26/12/23, 9:46 am - +263 71 349 0117: I concur with you that to have such an impact in the community it takes a lot of dedication towards my studies. It also takes a strong character and the ability to stay focused. A conducive environment for studying is also important to minimise distractions.
26/12/23, 10:12 am - Gurvinder: That is great.
26/12/23, 10:13 am - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
26/12/23, 11:04 am - +263 71 349 0117: I am not really surprised with this. Apart from being all former British colonies, India has the best industrial technologies compared to most African nations. Being able to study in India will be advantageous for me.
26/12/23, 11:45 am - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
26/12/23, 11:45 am - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

1. *Robust Education System:* India has 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges offering diverse educational paths.

26/12/23, 3:28 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
26/12/23, 3:44 pm - +263 71 349 0117: Thank you Sir, this is quite informative
26/12/23, 3:45 pm - +263 71 349 0117: Yes, I am here Sir.
26/12/23, 3:53 pm - Gurvinder: So now Caleb, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
26/12/23, 4:07 pm - +263 71 349 0117: I have understood Sir, thank you. For now I do not have any questions.
26/12/23, 4:07 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
26/12/23, 4:12 pm - +263 71 349 0117: We do not have much information about the fee structure of Indian institutions for an international student
26/12/23, 4:16 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
26/12/23, 4:16 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
26/12/23, 4:16 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
26/12/23, 4:16 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 4:16 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
26/12/23, 4:27 pm - +263 71 349 0117: Noted thank you Sir
26/12/23, 4:38 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
26/12/23, 4:40 pm - +263 71 349 0117: ok Sir, thank you.
26/12/23, 4:41 pm - Gurvinder: Caleb, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
26/12/23, 4:53 pm - +263 71 349 0117: Thank you Sir, this is quite informative
26/12/23, 4:53 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

26/12/23, 4:53 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-

26/12/23, 4:53 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

26/12/23, 4:54 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
26/12/23, 5:51 pm - +263 71 349 0117: I am optimistic that this will be a great opportunity for me to learn and also help by giving the ability to think outside the box on how we can be able to cope in this changing world interms of technology.
26/12/23, 9:20 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead.
