“*It is only when we take chances, when our lives improve*”

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
15/12/23, 9:01 am - +260 97 9205144: Good morning
15/12/23, 10:24 am - Gurvinder: Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
15/12/23, 11:09 am - +260 97 6317377: It is a scholarship program that sponsors students at some universities in India?
15/12/23, 12:25 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program.
15/12/23, 12:25 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
15/12/23, 12:25 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
15/12/23, 12:25 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
15/12/23, 12:25 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
15/12/23, 12:25 pm - Gurvinder: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia*
15/12/23, 12:25 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 12:25 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 12:25 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
15/12/23, 1:15 pm - +260 97 6317377: Yes I am.
15/12/23, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Denise, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
15/12/23, 6:08 pm - +260 97 6317377: Yes I do
15/12/23, 7:49 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
16/12/23, 8:36 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

Studying abroad will also provide me with alot of job opportunities which are very limited in this country.
26/12/23, 1:06 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
26/12/23, 1:18 pm - +260 97 6317377: After pursuing my higher education through this scholarship, I plan to apply my learnings from abroad to my country through research. After observing the problems that are there in my country such as lack of advanced technologies and knowledge on how to use them… I can help in developing these technologies which will have a significant impact. The education system here doesn’t use a lot of technology because it’s lacking specialists in that so having much knowledge and skills in that can enable me to help in the development of advanced technologies that will help in making the process of education much better and easier.
26/12/23, 1:25 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Denise, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
26/12/23, 1:30 pm - +260 97 6317377: Yes I agree
26/12/23, 1:34 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
26/12/23, 1:35 pm - +260 97 6317377: Yes I actually wanted to ask as well
26/12/23, 1:36 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
26/12/23, 1:36 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

26/12/23, 1:39 pm - +260 97 6317377: This is interesting
26/12/23, 1:40 pm - Gurvinder: So now Denise, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
26/12/23, 1:48 pm - +260 97 6317377: Yes , I have mentioned specialising in Al and Ml due to the interest that I recently developed in it…but I am not entirely certain that it is something I’ll manage to do so I want to know if I’ll be given the chance to explore my options that include technology ofcourse or i have to make a decision now <This message was edited>
26/12/23, 1:50 pm - Gurvinder: Yes Denise, MCA will open your doors to all kinds of specializations, do not worry about that.
26/12/23, 1:50 pm - +260 97 6317377: Alright thank you very much
26/12/23, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
26/12/23, 1:59 pm - +260 97 6317377: You mean how much it is costs without having a scholarship? <This message was edited>
26/12/23, 2:12 pm - Gurvinder: Yes.
26/12/23, 2:13 pm - +260 97 6317377: No we are not
26/12/23, 2:16 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
26/12/23, 2:16 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
26/12/23, 2:16 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
26/12/23, 2:16 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 2:16 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
26/12/23, 2:54 pm - +260 97 6317377: So the student will earn as they are learning when they enter the scholarship?
26/12/23, 2:54 pm - Gurvinder: Let me explain you the Earn While You Learn Program in depth.
26/12/23, 2:54 pm - Gurvinder: Denise, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
26/12/23, 3:00 pm - +260 97 6317377: That is good, so the jobs provided while learning are linked to what they learn
26/12/23, 3:02 pm - Gurvinder: Please, the work they do under this program teaches you practical skills like networking, confidence building, leadership skills, and much more, which give you an edge over other candidates when you go for an job interview.
26/12/23, 3:02 pm - +260 97 6317377: Oh okay I understand now
26/12/23, 3:03 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
26/12/23, 3:03 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
26/12/23, 3:03 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

26/12/23, 3:03 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
26/12/23, 3:12 pm - +260 97 6317377: Yes it can, seeing how Edoofa is supported by these companies and also the ability to be able to have an opportunity in any situation
26/12/23, 3:21 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Denise, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
26/12/23, 3:30 pm - +260 97 6317377: So the scholarship credits are for adding on to the tuition fees  and other expenses?
26/12/23, 3:31 pm - Gurvinder: The scholarship credits can be used to pay off your tuition fees only.
26/12/23, 3:32 pm - +260 97 6317377: So the $1000 covers the tuition fees for a year?
26/12/23, 3:34 pm - Gurvinder: If you can earn $1000, yes, that will cover the tuition fees for a year.
26/12/23, 3:35 pm - +260 97 6317377: Then if you don’t earn that amount, you won’t be able to pay for the tuition fees?
26/12/23, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: Denise, the EWYL program exists to ease the financial burden of your parents, the more credits you are able to earn, the less financial burden your parents will have.
26/12/23, 3:39 pm - +260 97 6317377: Okay I understand
26/12/23, 3:42 pm - +260 97 6317377: To make sure I understand, the tuition fees for university cost $2000 per year?
26/12/23, 3:42 pm - Gurvinder: Did you not read this?
26/12/23, 3:43 pm - +260 97 6317377: I did
26/12/23, 3:44 pm - Gurvinder: Then may I know why are you asking things that I have explained you twice through text and diagram?
26/12/23, 3:46 pm - +260 97 6317377: I just wanted to make sure that I understand completely
26/12/23, 3:53 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
26/12/23, 3:53 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

26/12/23, 3:54 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
26/12/23, 3:56 pm - +260 97 6317377: Wow
26/12/23, 3:57 pm - +260 97 6317377: Yes you are different indeed, I didn’t know that you can self sponsor your tuition for international education
26/12/23, 4:02 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Denise, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
26/12/23, 4:05 pm - +260 97 6317377: Yes
26/12/23, 4:06 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
26/12/23, 4:08 pm - +260 97 6317377: Yes, so far I have just informed them about the MCA course and the Earn while you learn program
26/12/23, 4:09 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
26/12/23, 4:09 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
26/12/23, 4:10 pm - +260 97 6317377: Yes
26/12/23, 4:10 pm - Gurvinder: Denise as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
26/12/23, 4:12 pm - +260 97 6317377: $1500-$2250
26/12/23, 4:13 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Denise, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
26/12/23, 4:13 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 4:17 pm - +260 97 6317377: Meaning the student only pays $350 for application process?
26/12/23, 4:18 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
26/12/23, 4:18 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
26/12/23, 4:20 pm - +260 97 6317377: Yes it is
26/12/23, 4:20 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
26/12/23, 4:20 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
26/12/23, 4:21 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
26/12/23, 4:24 pm - +260 97 6317377: This is okay seeing that parents are given enough time to pay in full
26/12/23, 4:32 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
26/12/23, 4:32 pm - +260 97 6317377: No
26/12/23, 4:35 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 4:36 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Denise, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zambia itself.
26/12/23, 4:36 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
26/12/23, 4:39 pm - +260 97 6317377: Yes I do
26/12/23, 4:39 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
26/12/23, 4:39 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
26/12/23, 4:39 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
26/12/23, 4:39 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
26/12/23, 4:47 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
26/12/23, 4:47 pm - +260 97 6317377: Yes I was reading thoroughly
