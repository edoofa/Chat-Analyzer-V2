20/12/23, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: May I know the reason behind the delay please?
20/12/23, 12:44 pm - +263 78 719 9961: it was just a small issue but now I have finished
20/12/23, 1:05 pm - Harmehak: I understand
20/12/23, 1:05 pm - Harmehak: *Alright so Tanatswa, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Serima high charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
20/12/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 719 9961: ok so I'm tanatswa chipare 
so as for what I have archived during my exams that is grade 7(with 8 units as for 5 written subjects)and my form form 4(with 8As 1B 2Cc as for 11 written subjects in science class) and still waiting for my a level results(maths physics and chemistry) I think I am an average student.
so I have done my studies at serima from form 1 up to form 6  and we paid 410USD every term. 
so I would like to study medicine because becoming a doctor was the only dream I wanted to live.
i have got my strength in sciences especially chemistry and haven't  discover my weakness yet  because with hardwork I still don't believe weakness exists.
so as for me I love playing chess and also love doing some gardening at home.
so my mother has got a degree in business management and IT still looking for a job and my father is an electrician and younger brothers who are still going on with their studies that is form 3 ,grade 3 and the youngest not yet going to school
20/12/23, 2:49 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Tanatswa, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

Are you the eldest sibling please?
20/12/23, 2:51 pm - +263 78 719 9961: thank you .yes I am the eldest
20/12/23, 3:08 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please
20/12/23, 3:08 pm - Harmehak: Well Tanatswa now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
20/12/23, 3:17 pm - +263 78 719 9961: Yes I believe
20/12/23, 3:32 pm - Harmehak: Alright and would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
20/12/23, 3:35 pm - +263 78 719 9961: Yes I am prepared
20/12/23, 4:11 pm - Harmehak: Tanatswa, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
20/12/23, 4:51 pm - +263 78 719 9961: Ok
20/12/23, 4:58 pm - Harmehak: Yes please?
20/12/23, 7:40 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now, I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
21/12/23, 8:55 am - +263 78 719 9961: Yes they are
21/12/23, 9:05 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
21/12/23, 9:09 am - +263 78 719 9961: Morning yes we can start
21/12/23, 9:29 am - Harmehak: I await your response, Tanatswa
21/12/23, 9:32 am - +263 78 719 9961: Yes they are aware they are in this group
21/12/23, 9:53 am - Harmehak: Duly noted!

So are they willing to support you financially and mentally as well, Tanatswa?
21/12/23, 9:54 am - +263 78 719 9961: Yes
21/12/23, 10:04 am - Harmehak: Duly noted, Tanatswa!
21/12/23, 10:04 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
21/12/23, 10:07 am - +263 78 719 9961: Yes I am confident
21/12/23, 10:24 am - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Medicine ?
21/12/23, 11:25 am - Harmehak: Please?
21/12/23, 12:35 pm - +263 78 719 9961: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: Received please
21/12/23, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: What motivates you to study Medicine, Tanatswa?
21/12/23, 12:41 pm - +263 78 719 9961: The fact that I always wanted to be a doctor  and the feeling of wanting to help people with their lives motivates me
21/12/23, 12:48 pm - Harmehak: Alright please,

I can see you have a kind heart, Tanatswa. <This message was edited>
21/12/23, 12:49 pm - +263 78 719 9961: thank you so much
21/12/23, 12:54 pm - Harmehak: So why didn't you pursue Biology, Tanatswa?

I believe it's an important science subject for medicine considering medicine is all about human body and living organisms!

Wouldn't you agree?
21/12/23, 12:56 pm - +263 78 719 9961: I chose physics over biology because at serima biology teachers don't produce good biology results so I just decided physics would be the best
21/12/23, 12:58 pm - Harmehak: Oh alright please
21/12/23, 12:58 pm - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
21/12/23, 1:04 pm - +263 78 719 9961: Ok does it mean there is no more room for medicine due to my subjects
21/12/23, 1:05 pm - Harmehak: Unfortunately, no.

Biology is a strict requirement!
21/12/23, 1:05 pm - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are :

*1. Bachelor in Pharmacy*
*2. Bachelor in Optometry*
*3. Bachelor of Technology in Biomedical Engineering*
*4. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*
*5. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics* <This message was edited>
21/12/23, 1:09 pm - +263 78 719 9961: Ok
21/12/23, 1:09 pm - +263 78 719 9961: so what about if I want to do chemical engineering
21/12/23, 1:12 pm - Harmehak: You can pursue Engineering, Tanatswa.
21/12/23, 1:12 pm - Harmehak: These are options in Medical or health line.

Along with these you can pursue Engineering fields too.
21/12/23, 1:12 pm - Harmehak: Meanwhile, I would be scheduling your session for *Saturday at 10 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
