Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
19/12/23, 4:18 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa.

19/12/23, 4:43 pm - +27 63 549 2124: Does the prospective student choose any course of their choice or do they have to write some psychometric test to see where they most compatible?
19/12/23, 4:45 pm - Harmehak: They get to decide their course, 

However they should qualify for the same as per their subject combination.

23/12/23, 10:30 am - Harmehak: Yes please, Lubelihle,

Shall we start with our discussion?
23/12/23, 10:36 am - +27 71 799 9654: Yes we may start
23/12/23, 10:36 am - +27 71 799 9654: I am ready and waiting
23/12/23, 10:40 am - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Lubelihle, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!

It's great to know of your personality traits along with the influence of your parents and grandmother who greatly assist you in every domain of your life.
23/12/23, 10:43 am - +27 71 799 9654: Thank you, I am glad I managed to give you a greater insight to what I am all about. Do you have any other questions for me, I will be more than happy to respond to the best of my ability.
23/12/23, 10:43 am - Harmehak: That's great,

We shall discuss during our session today.
23/12/23, 10:44 am - Harmehak: Firstly, I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
23/12/23, 10:46 am - +27 63 549 2124: The 6 points are derived from subjects completed or % achieved per subject?
23/12/23, 10:48 am - +27 71 799 9654: Yes Mam, I am very confident that I will make the required grades. I have been working very hard from the beginning of the year and will continue to do so till the days of my final exams.
23/12/23, 10:59 am - Harmehak: Achieved please
23/12/23, 10:59 am - Harmehak: That's great,

I am delighted to see your efforts.
23/12/23, 11:00 am - Harmehak: Well Lubelihle now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
23/12/23, 11:05 am - +27 71 799 9654: Thank you for the question Mam. Kindly be patient with me as I type to respond, I have a few thought on education abroad and greatly believe it is a life changing decision and several reasons why
23/12/23, 11:06 am - +27 71 799 9654: Thoughts**
23/12/23, 11:11 am - Harmehak: Surely Lubelihle.
23/12/23, 11:13 am - +27 71 799 9654: Firstly India to be specific has a very good track record on having very good education curriculum especially in the Medicine field that I wish to pursue. Secondly, the universities are very modern with advanced facilities and equipment that help students acquire latest and updated means of treating different ailments and diseases.  This will be of great advantage to me and give me a broader experience and knowledge of how to treat patients especially in less developed countries like mine and other African countries.
23/12/23, 11:17 am - +27 71 799 9654: It will also be a bi life changing experience as I will get to network and interact with different people from different ethnicities. Which will help me understand other cultures and more especially how they affect or impact the health sector in their respective countries. I will learn a lot and aim to implement the good practice I will have obtained to my home country and the less privileged.
23/12/23, 11:18 am - +27 71 799 9654: I hope my response is to your satisfaction Mam ☺️
23/12/23, 11:29 am - Harmehak: Definitely well put across, Lubelihle,

I can see you understand the impact of international higher education!

So would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
23/12/23, 11:34 am - +27 71 799 9654: Yes Mam, I am mentally prepared for a life abroad. Especially looking at the positive side and the benefits compared to the fewer cons of missing family. I will have the opportunity to better myself and make my long life dream become a reality.
23/12/23, 11:35 am - Harmehak: Lubelihle, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
23/12/23, 11:38 am - +27 71 799 9654: Yes Mam, I completely agree with you. My parents and grandmother are my prime support and are equally as committed to helping me pursue my educational aspirations.
23/12/23, 11:40 am - +27 71 799 9654: My family are aware if my plans to study abroad and I have their full support. However as much as they will try to put their best foot forward financially, I am hoping for a fully sponsored scholarship that will help ease the financial strain.
23/12/23, 11:40 am - +27 71 799 9654: Of**
23/12/23, 11:40 am - +27 63 549 2124: How much  does a MBCHB course usually  cost per annum, without scholarships?
23/12/23, 11:41 am - +27 63 549 2124: This is so that we can put things in perspective.
23/12/23, 12:01 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate.
23/12/23, 12:01 pm - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
23/12/23, 12:01 pm - Harmehak: I shall discuss the costs once her course is finalized please.
23/12/23, 12:09 pm - +27 71 799 9654: Ok Mam, thank you for the clarification. I now fully understand the terms and difference them
23/12/23, 12:10 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome
23/12/23, 12:10 pm - Harmehak: I hope you are clear that Edoofa does offer scholarship itself?
23/12/23, 12:14 pm - +27 71 799 9654: Okay. Please still consider me and advise on the next step forward
23/12/23, 12:19 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please
23/12/23, 1:11 pm - Harmehak: Lubelihle, you mentioned your desire to study Medicine,

So were you able to research about the requirements to pursue Medicine in India?
23/12/23, 1:20 pm - +27 63 549 2124: Are they different  from SA? Science  subjects and preferably  70% pass mark.
23/12/23, 1:22 pm - Harmehak: Yes please.
23/12/23, 1:22 pm - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
23/12/23, 1:25 pm - +27 71 799 9654: Yes Mam. I am currently in A'Level doing Physics, Chemistry and Biology. And as I mentioned to you previously, I am excelling and obtained the highest grades in my class for all three subjects this year.
23/12/23, 1:29 pm - Harmehak: May I please have your previous term's results?
23/12/23, 1:30 pm - Harmehak: You mentioned Mathematics, Biology and Chemistry please
23/12/23, 1:38 pm - +27 71 799 9654: Apologies for my error. I am doing Maths, Chemistry and Biology. Please allow me to send my results at a later stage. My report book is at home and I am currently away on holiday till the new year. There is no-one at home to access my files.
23/12/23, 1:43 pm - +27 71 799 9654: In this case does it mean I will not qualify unless I supplement physics??
23/12/23, 2:19 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please.
23/12/23, 2:19 pm - Harmehak: Unfortunately, Physics is a mandatory requirement.
23/12/23, 2:19 pm - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy*
23/12/23, 2:22 pm - +27 71 799 9654: Thank you for the information. Kindly book us another session to give me enough time to research on the options you have provided me.
23/12/23, 2:23 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome,

I am here to assist,

What is your understanding so far, Lubelihle?
23/12/23, 2:41 pm - +27 71 799 9654: I understand that it is a mandatory requirement to have the three science subjects which are physics biology and chemistry if I am to study medicine in India.
23/12/23, 2:43 pm - +27 71 799 9654: However according to the subjects that i am studying in A"Level you have provided me with several other course options that I can consider. <This message was edited>
23/12/23, 2:45 pm - +27 71 799 9654: Hence my asking for more time to research on the options provided to see which I will be more aligned to.
23/12/23, 5:26 pm - Harmehak: Very correct, Lubelihle.
23/12/23, 5:26 pm - Harmehak: That's alright please
23/12/23, 5:26 pm - Harmehak: Since we celebrate Christmas on Monday, *Hence, We will now connect on Tuesday at 9:30 AM CAT*. Please be online during your session time!

In the meantime please go through the links I am sharing for a better understanding of the program
