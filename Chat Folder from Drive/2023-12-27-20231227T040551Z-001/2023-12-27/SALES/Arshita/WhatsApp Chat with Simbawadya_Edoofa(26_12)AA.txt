26/12/23, 2:45 pm - Arshita: As per the protocols of the program, the representation of your parents/guardians who will be supporting your education is necessary for the group so that they can follow the sessions and I can address their thoughts and queries directly. As you know higher education is a big decision that requires the support of your family. *So I am making you the admin of the group so please add them and let me know once they are added.*

In case they are not available right now, they can still be part of a group and catch up with the conversations later. Let me know the names with which I should address them.
