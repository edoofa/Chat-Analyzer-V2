26/12/23, 11:18 am - +263 78 441 4013: 1) Education is expensive in my country and more focus is put on  the theory side rather than the practical side which then makes it difficult to seek for employment opportunities abroad.  I also wish to pursue my tertiary education in India so that l will be exposed to more employment opportunities which is something  offered in my country .

26/12/23, 3:10 pm - Arshita: Noted
26/12/23, 3:10 pm - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. 

I hope you are confident about achieving it.
26/12/23, 3:12 pm - +263 78 441 4013: Yes l am very much confident
26/12/23, 3:13 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
26/12/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 441 4013: I did my research but this is my first time to apply to a University abroad
26/12/23, 3:16 pm - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.
