26/10/23, 11:00 am - Tushti: I am glad to see that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
26/10/23, 11:03 am - +27 67 804 4619: In my current country of residence Universities are costly and difficult for foreign nationals to aquire placements
26/10/23, 11:13 am - Tushti: I understand
26/10/23, 11:14 am - Tushti: So now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination

May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?
26/10/23, 11:37 am - +27 67 804 4619: I have my friend Hilario who is a student at LPU .He gives me information regarding his living standards and how he is learning.

Hearing that his experience is great so far .I do not think it will be hassle for me
26/10/23, 12:03 pm - Tushti: I am glad to hear that
26/10/23, 12:03 pm - Tushti: You see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

26/10/23, 12:04 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
26/10/23, 12:04 pm - Tushti: So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself? Did you learn about it from Hilario?
26/10/23, 12:38 pm - +27 67 804 4619: No
26/10/23, 1:08 pm - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
26/10/23, 1:08 pm - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
26/10/23, 1:08 pm - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
26/10/23, 1:09 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
26/10/23, 1:09 pm - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
26/10/23, 1:09 pm - Tushti: In simple words Kelvin,  what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
26/10/23, 1:35 pm - +27 67 804 4619: Okay I understand
26/10/23, 2:27 pm - Tushti: Now, let me brief you about the EWYL Profram
26/10/23, 2:28 pm - Tushti: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
26/10/23, 2:28 pm - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
26/10/23, 2:28 pm - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

26/10/23, 2:28 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
26/10/23, 2:28 pm - Tushti: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
26/10/23, 3:15 pm - Tushti: Are we connected, Kelvin?
26/10/23, 3:38 pm - +27 67 804 4619: Yes
26/10/23, 3:44 pm - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
26/10/23, 3:46 pm - +27 67 804 4619: Yes
26/10/23, 3:52 pm - Tushti: Kelvin, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
26/10/23, 3:55 pm - +27 67 804 4619: $1500-2250
26/10/23, 3:57 pm - Tushti: Exactly Kelvin, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
26/10/23, 3:58 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
26/10/23, 3:58 pm - Tushti: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
26/10/23, 3:58 pm - Tushti: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
26/10/23, 4:01 pm - +27 67 804 4619: Yes it makes it simpler
26/10/23, 4:06 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
26/10/23, 4:07 pm - Tushti: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are required to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
26/10/23, 4:07 pm - Tushti: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
26/10/23, 4:11 pm - +27 67 804 4619: Okay
26/10/23, 4:11 pm - Tushti: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
26/10/23, 4:12 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
26/10/23, 4:13 pm - Tushti: Alright Kelvin, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
26/10/23, 4:13 pm - Tushti: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
26/10/23, 4:13 pm - Tushti: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
26/10/23, 4:13 pm - Tushti: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
26/10/23, 4:13 pm - Tushti: With this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, would you like to ask anything?
26/10/23, 4:21 pm - +27 67 804 4619: Nothing for now
26/10/23, 4:22 pm - Tushti: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
26/10/23, 4:22 pm - Tushti: And, for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have. 

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *tomorrow  Mr. Shubham* would also be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *Parent participation is mandatory in this session.*

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment.

Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

Life in Rwanda 16 years after the genocide has been gradually progressing.However, Rwanda remains marked by both resilience and challenges. The Rwandan Genocide of 1994, which claimed the lives of over 700 000 people, left deep scars on the nation.Yet, since then, Rwanda has undergone a remarkable transformation.

One of the most significant changes has been on the social and political area. The Rwandan government,which led by President Paul Kagame, has prioritized unity and reconciliation. Efforts like the Gacaca courts, designed to facilitate truth and reconciliation, have been key in healing the wounds of the past. This has created a sense of national unity, and ethnic divisions are no longer as big as they once were.

On the economic part Rwanda has shown great growth. The country has embraced a vision for economic development, emphasizing sectors like technology, agriculture, and tourism. Kigali, the capital city, is often seen as the "Singapore of Africa" due to its cleanliness and modern infrastructure. The government has invested heavily in education, healthcare, and infrastructure, leading to tangible improvements in the standard of living for many Rwandans.

Education and healthcare have seen significant progress as well. Rwanda has also achieved impressive leaps in primary education, with a focus on reducing the gender gap in enrollment of students.Access to healthcare has improved through community health workers and health insurance schemes. These improvements have contributed to a healthier and more educated population of Rwanda 

Despite these advancements, several challenges persist. Poverty remains a pressing issue, particularly in rural areas. Many survivors of the genocide still live on with psychological trauma, and the scars of the past continue to affect families and communities. Moreover, political freedom and human rights have been subject to criticism, with concerns about the suppression of opposing voices.

The genocide's legacy is also evident in the demographic landscape, with a significant number of survivors and perpetrators living side by side. This complex coexistence allows ongoing efforts to foster reconciliation and ensure justice for the victims of the genocide 

In conclusion, life in Rwanda 16 years after the genocide is marked by impressive progress in many areas. The nation has made significant strides in unity, economic development, education, and healthcare. However, the shadows of the past still loom large, with ongoing challenges related to poverty, psychological trauma, and political freedom. Rwanda serves as a remarkable example of a nation's ability to rebuild and transform itself in the face of unspeakable tragedy, but the journey towards complete healing and reconciliation continues.

My Inspirational Story
Life often presents us with tons challenges and opportunities that mold our journeys. My inspirational story is a testament to the power of determination, resilience, and the support of those who believed in me.

I was born into a humble home in South Africa, and my life's early years were far from luxurious.Economic hardships were there, but they instilled in me a burning desire to overcome adversity or what we know as "poverty". Education became my lifeline, and I saw it as a means to break free from the constraints of my circumstances.

Through relentless  determination, I tried and excelled in my studies, enough to earn me scholarships and grants that assisted me in pursuing higher education. This set me on a path towards a brighter future.I was determined to create and succeed despite the challenges I had.

However, my journey was far from easy. Countless obstacles tested me, making me question my abilities to perform things. However, I discovered the power of resilience during these trying times. I learned to adapt, persevere, and view setbacks as stepping stones to my own personal growth.

On my journey, I encountered mentors and role models like : Cristiano Ronaldo and Conor McGregor who played a important role in shaping my aspirations. Their wisdom and beliefs in my potential were important in my journey. Their stories of triumph over adversity served as a Pillar of inspiration, propelling me to keep moving forward.

In my pursuit of personal and professional growth, I realized the importance of giving back. I became involved in community service and outreach programs, helping those facing circumstances similar to that of my own. This was my way of paying forward the inspiration I had received from others, and it gave me a deeper sense of purpose in my life.

My inspirational story is not defined by enormous achievements but by my  spirit's capacity to endure, adapt, and flourish. It's a story of mental determination, resilience, and the transformative power of education. It highlights the significance of mentors and role models who believed in me and the value of giving back to our communities.

I've come to understand that inspiration is an ever-evolving force that guides us through life's complexities. I hope that my story can inspire so many in tough situations to pursue their dreams, overcome challenges, and make a positive impact on the world.

In essence of life, each of us has our own version of an inspirational story to share. It's a story built with our experiences, choices, and the people who influence our journey. My story serves as a reminder that regardless of our starting points, we have the power to write our own inspiring chapters in the book called life.

07/11/23, 5:19 pm - +27 73 347 1166: No for now
07/11/23, 5:22 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So what is the enrollment fee payment deadline mentioned in your acceptance letter?
07/11/23, 5:24 pm - +27 73 347 1166: We have 2 on the 12th of Nov and 12th of Dec.
07/11/23, 5:26 pm - +27 73 347 1166: Is it compulsory to pay the $200 first then the $150 next or can it be done vice versa
07/11/23, 5:28 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please, Are you not financially prepared to full the $200 in the next 7  days?
07/11/23, 5:30 pm - +27 73 347 1166: Yes
07/11/23, 5:30 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So you will be able to raise the $150 before the 12th of November?
07/11/23, 5:32 pm - +27 73 347 1166: Most probably
07/11/23, 5:36 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So are you aware of the transaction methods?
07/11/23, 5:37 pm - +27 73 347 1166: Yes we are aware.
07/11/23, 5:38 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Alright so, if you have gone through your Letter of Acceptance thoroughly, you must have seen, that there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

May I know which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
07/11/23, 5:40 pm - +27 73 347 1166: The first option
07/11/23, 5:48 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $80 to $100 which becomes quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $80 to $100 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr Shorwi's Account.

So as you can see in the letter there is a Bank deposit in, Mr Shorwi Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School's account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe
07/11/23, 5:48 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The fee payment can also be made through Hartzell High. School Ex-Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, *the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be 12.5% of the fees you are paying* the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

BRANCH: Mutare

ACC NAME: Kawadza Shorwi

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 0918 0214

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 364 0738
07/11/23, 5:51 pm - +27 73 347 1166: Oh okay.i had not noticed.

09/11/23, 5:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: @27721773967 you see the only reason I was seeking an update from you was. since I am well aware that in Zimbabwe there are severe Network Issues in Zimbabwe in a lot of regions because of which the bank sometimes faces server issues so in the past there have been parents who had to miss their deadline because their fees couldn't be completed on the same day of the due date, Instead, it took additional 2-3 days which delayed the overall progress of their child's admission.
09/11/23, 5:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As your counsellor, I can only recommend you to try and complete the formalities a day or two prior to the deadline so that such issues are avoided and you as parents do not have to be stressed regarding the same!

09/11/23, 8:10 pm - +27 72 177 3967: Yes, we are, but we are hoping for the best.

14/11/23, 4:49 pm - +27 67 804 4619: Oh yes! I had issues understanding why I could not do mechanical engineering even through in my Current grade 12 curriculum.
I am doing a subject called *physics sciences* —which contains sub divisions of *Physics* and *Chemistry* .
And in my current finals I was examined on *Physics*-paper 1 and *chemistry* -paper 2.My final's results in January will arrive with  physical  sciences as one subject and have a single mark obtained from both exams are combined.

And people who have *physical sciences* as a subject in South Africa are able to study Mechanical Engineering in South African Universities.

That really troubled me.
14/11/23, 4:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Kelvin, With your subjects you are eligible for Computer Science Engineering, But for Mechanical Engineering according to the Indian Education Board Guidelines, Physics and Chemistry are mandatory subjects. We understand that in South Africa Physical science is a culmination of Physics and Chemistry, *so I would need you to share your course curriculum or Syllabus for Physical sciences so that our team can compare the same with our requirements here in Indiai and guide you with the further process accordingly!*

15/11/23, 12:36 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please since you will be internationally transacting the  amount to Hillario, Then you can do the same directly to our accounts then?
15/11/23, 12:59 pm - +27 73 347 1166: I'm afraid not, because our method of international  transfer is mama money,which will deposit the money under Hilario phone number at a low interest rate and then he will deposit directly into your account in India
15/11/23, 1:56 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I understand please
