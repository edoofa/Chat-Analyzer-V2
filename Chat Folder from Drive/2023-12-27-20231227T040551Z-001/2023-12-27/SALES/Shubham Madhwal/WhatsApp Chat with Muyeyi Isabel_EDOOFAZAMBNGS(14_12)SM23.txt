We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!

19/12/23, 10:16 am - Shubham Madhwal: So are you available for the session?
19/12/23, 10:16 am - +260 96 0868720: That's great
19/12/23, 10:17 am - +260 96 0868720: Yes please
19/12/23, 10:17 am - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
19/12/23, 10:20 am - +260 96 0868720: Not really this is the only university I've applied to
19/12/23, 10:39 am - Shubham Madhwal: As you're aware of the fact that you'll be starting your higher education here in India, may I know if you've any Knowledge about the Cost of Education here?
19/12/23, 11:09 am - +260 96 0868720: Yes partially I was told that it's k1500
19/12/23, 1:55 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.
19/12/23, 1:56 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:

1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation <This message was edited>

19/12/23, 2:20 pm - +260 96 0868720: Noted and understood
19/12/23, 2:41 pm - Shubham Madhwal: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
19/12/23, 2:42 pm - +260 96 0868720: Noted
19/12/23, 2:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So shall I now update you about the Earn While You Learn Program?
19/12/23, 3:01 pm - +260 96 0868720: Yes please
19/12/23, 3:04 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
19/12/23, 3:04 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
19/12/23, 3:04 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
19/12/23, 3:05 pm - +260 96 0868720: That sounds great
19/12/23, 3:19 pm - Shubham Madhwal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
19/12/23, 3:19 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
19/12/23, 3:19 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
* Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

19/12/23, 3:19 pm - Shubham Madhwal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*

19/12/23, 4:19 pm - Shubham Madhwal: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
20/12/23, 10:15 am - +260 96 0868720: Good morning

20/12/23, 10:18 am - Shubham Madhwal: So shall we continue from here?
20/12/23, 10:18 am - +260 96 0868720: Yes please
20/12/23, 10:25 am - Shubham Madhwal: Step 1: It’s basically the counselling process with the senior career counsellor who will help you with the information related to the Edoofa Program and help you prepare for the Eligibility Interview
20/12/23, 10:25 am - Shubham Madhwal: Step 2: It is the eligibility check process where you will be interviewed by the Program Director to examine your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
20/12/23, 10:25 am - Shubham Madhwal: Step 3: Once you clear the Eligibility Interview with the Program Director you will receive an Acceptance Letter from Edoofa. It is after this step that you have to pay the $350 enrollment fees Within the 7 day period of receiving the acceptance letter.
20/12/23, 10:25 am - Shubham Madhwal: Step 4: This step is about the enrollment into the Edoofa Program.
20/12/23, 10:25 am - Shubham Madhwal: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.
20/12/23, 10:25 am - Shubham Madhwal: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
20/12/23, 10:25 am - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
 *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
20/12/23, 10:28 am - +260 96 0868720: Noted
20/12/23, 11:01 am - Shubham Madhwal: That’s great, So now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling:
20/12/23, 11:01 am - Shubham Madhwal: 1. *Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
20/12/23, 11:01 am - Shubham Madhwal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
20/12/23, 11:01 am - Shubham Madhwal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
20/12/23, 11:01 am - Shubham Madhwal: 4. *Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.
20/12/23, 11:01 am - Shubham Madhwal: So which thing do you find the most interesting about Edoofa, from the points mentioned above and why?
20/12/23, 11:02 am - +260 96 0868720: Earn while you learn
20/12/23, 11:22 am - Shubham Madhwal: And why do you like this point?
20/12/23, 11:23 am - +260 96 0868720: It works as a motivation so students work very hard to earn more
20/12/23, 11:23 am - +260 96 0868720: It works as a motivation so students work very hard to earn more
20/12/23, 11:56 am - Shubham Madhwal: That's really good. Now as I have mentioned about the various benefits that you get once you enrol with Edoofa earlier, did I tell you that a student also saves around $1000-$1500 in College Application fees when affiliated with Edoofa?
20/12/23, 12:04 pm - +260 96 0868720: Yes you did
20/12/23, 12:18 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Let me tell you For Admission forms, a student on average may end up paying *$1000-$1500*. For a Statement of Purpose (SOP), the cost is between *$300-$500*.
Edoofa also helps you with Visa Documentation, University Selection, and sessions, Seels Learning Centre (SLC) classes, etc, All these facilities would cost you more than *$2000* without Edoofa, but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad *for only $350*. This $350 is the Edoofa enrollment fee.
20/12/23, 12:19 pm - +260 96 0868720: Noted
20/12/23, 12:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please *The enrollment fee is charged to you for*:

1. Edoofa provides foster care to all its students. This is more like a family with health insurance, mentor assistance, and counsellor help. The enrollment fee includes the Application forms, SOPs, visa assistance, University sessions, etc

2. We offer a comprehensive training program on Employability Skills for the entire course. The Earn While You Learn Program, is a department where the child learns skills and also gets an opportunity to earn $50-$100 per month. 

3. The guaranteed 50-100% Scholarship we offer to our students.
20/12/23, 12:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 12:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Earlier the enrollment fee was $750 but due to this pandemic, we understand the problem faced so we have initiated the relief package so now the cost is reduced to $350 and is to be paid once you are found eligible for the program and then your earn while you learn will start and other parts then you can by your scholarship credits. The enrollment fees have to be paid Within the 7-day period of receiving this letter.
20/12/23, 1:53 pm - +260 96 0868720: That's great
20/12/23, 1:53 pm - +260 96 0868720: Noted
20/12/23, 2:01 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
20/12/23, 2:01 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).
20/12/23, 2:01 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 3:* Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
20/12/23, 2:01 pm - Shubham Madhwal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
20/12/23, 2:01 pm - +260 96 0868720: This is wonderful
20/12/23, 2:01 pm - +260 96 0868720: That's great
20/12/23, 2:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great, So now I will explain the entire process and the benefits that you receive once you are enrolled with Edoofa,

Once you enrol yourself with us, I will start your admission process and assign your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. After that, we will connect you with the universities to clear all your doubts and also if the university has any questions for you.
20/12/23, 2:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: We have experience working with over 250+ universities and with that experience, you will have a proper admission expert assisting you with your admission. Edoofa's academic team will help the students to have university sessions to enable them to get admission via our scholarship fund. (This process also happens while the students remain in their home country and they receive letters from the University directly).

Once the university sessions are over, students will secure the Admission offer letter (LOI) from the respective universities based on Edoofa's recommendation at the end you will be given multiple admission offer letters from the top universities which are applicable for your course and hence you will have the freedom to choose the university in which you will pursue your higher education.
20/12/23, 3:04 pm - +260 96 0868720: Noted
20/12/23, 3:05 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great so I have an assignment for you, No need to panic as the answers to every question is resting in this chat itself, so make sure if you don't know the answer find it from the chat and then write it down

20/12/23, 6:27 pm - +260 96 0868720: Yes please
20/12/23, 6:27 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 1.Well Edoofa Scholarship Program is an innovative program initiated by Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. under the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative that solves the problems of Affordability and Employability in Higher Education by enabling students to Earn Scholarship Credits and Learn 21st century job skills. Through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, Edoofians are provided 50-100% scholarships to study their dream courses alongside working on live projects that help them earn scholarship credits. We help African students in self-financing their Education.
In short, The Edoofa Program, through the SEELS initiative, is bridging the gap between Financial Aid, College Education and Employability.
20/12/23, 6:27 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 2. For the selected students who are able to qualify for the *EDOOFA Program* by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to *$2000-$3000* per year. This cost includes:

1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
20/12/23, 6:27 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 3. let me tell you dear the *enrollment fee* was $750 but due to this pandemic, we understand the problem faced so we have initiated the relief package so now the cost is reduced to $350 and is to be paid once you are found eligible for the program and then your earn while you learn will start and other parts then you can by your scholarship credits. The enrollment fees have to be paid Within the 7-day period of receiving this letter.
20/12/23, 6:27 pm - Shubham Madhwal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
20/12/23, 6:27 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I hope you now understand the process better?

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment.

Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

Introduction. The life in Rwanda 16 years after a genocide. In the first place, it is very much important to note that, genocide in Rwanda happened in 1994. The genocide is a civil war which took almost hundred days between the Tutsi, Hatu and Twa tribes. The Twa , are the fewest people, followed by the Tutsi and Hutu are the majority. During the genocide, the heavily armed Hutu militia killed many people from the three tribes with the majority being Tutsi. The women were raped and abused in all manner one can think of. I must mention that, long before the genocide, the three tribes lived in harmony and practiced intermarriage without any problem. However, after the genocide, even after 16 years, life in Rwanda has never been the same.
Poverty and Living Conditions. Poverty and seasonal variations in the price of many food and crops, did limit the capacity of many people in Rwanda. Accessing food and many basic commodities was never easy as many if not the majority of people lived below $1 in a day. Rebuilding a nation which has experienced war even if it is internal, is not easy. Many people could have lost a lot during genocide to point that, even after 16 years some people did not recover from this event. The impact of the genocide was so huge as many men were killed leaving women leading their families. In some  cases, some families lost both parents, their father and mother in the genocide leaving the eldest child leading the family. This still is the most painful things about the genocide in Rwanda. 
The Effects Of Genocide. The effects of genocide in Rwanda, were in both short and long terms to the survivors. Since we are talking about life in Rwanda after 16 years when genocide happened, the effects I wish to mention here, are long ones. Firstly, the trauma the survivors went through during the genocide had affected in many ways even 16 years. In my mind, I have the women who were raped occasionally by different armed soldiers, it is obvious that, life was not making sense. Some found it hard to move on or forgot their bad experiences. The Children who lost their both parents, could have been going through a lot. There can never be a bad experience, than seeing your own mother being raped and killed or seeing your father being abused, tortured until he dies. It is obvious that, many children who had these experiences were affected negatively. To some extent, most of these women and children continued to live in fear. 
The other effect could be depression which obviously affected the survivors psychologically. This situation could have made them to live not only in fear but it could have made it difficult for them to trust each other. The Tutsi could no longer trust the Hutu. The intermarriages which were high before the genocide had reduced. Social interaction and integration of tribes was very much a big challenge. Though tribalism and hurt speech contributed massively to the genocide, even after 16 years, tribalism and hurt speech continued. Those who lost their relatives in genocide found hard to forgive those they perceived to have killed or contributed to the demise of their loved ones. 
Politically. It should mentioned here that, after 16 year since the genocide happened in Rwanda, politically the nation was moving to the right direction. Though, in terms of democracy, many opposition parties continued complaining concerning the obstacles they facing in the political cycle. On the other hand, the government in power embarked on robust development program which was appreciated even by the international agencies. Many survivors received this development program with thanksgiving in their hearts. Inspired by the President, many people started working hard to rebuild their loved nation. This development has really changed Rwanda cities greatly. 
Economically. Like I have already pointed at the fact that, many people in Rwanda at that time were living below $1. However, it must be noted that, this is the case in many African nations. Many thanks goes to the government, which put in place some good policies.

It identifies its participants during the final year of school. It accords students not only an education but also practical experience in their studies. Its advantages include affordability and earning while learning . Parents need to support financially and psychologically as the program with not provide everything.

23/12/23, 12:00 am - +260 96 0868720: MY INSPIRATIONAL STORY
   Growing up as a child I always dreamt of being a successful young woman and to be an inspiration to many people. 
   Throughout my life I always had my parents' support and motivation which pushed me to go through all stages of life despite being an introvert.
Things became a bit hard for me when I was in eighth because had to leave my home town and my parents to go to a boarding school. I feared that I would get bullied because of my shyness, during my first days of boarding school I felt like I wouldn't manage but as days went by I was able to make new friends and adapt to the environment.
The teachers and pupils at Njase girls secondary school were very friendly hence making it easier for me to adapt.
  At school I worked very hard so that I could achieve my dreams because laziness never pays off. I used every opportunity I had to study but I still had time for things like scripture union because in everything that we do God is needed and to also learn moral aspects of society.
   Even as I stayed in school I made sure I had time for all things that mattered to me
23/12/23, 12:13 am - +260 96 0868720: I loved soccer so during my free time I used to go to the pitch with my team mates to play soccer by then I was a midfield playing number 9, I loved football but I didn't want it to be my profession so I focussed more on my books.
  Despite me struggling in subjects like mathematics and chitonga (Zambian language) I never gave up on them, I made sure I practiced and studied them frequently until I finally understood their concepts and improved greatly. I didn't give up at any point because I believe that our failures are there to be a lesson to show us what we shouldn't do if we want to succeed. 
 At the end of my o'level we wrote our exams and I passed with flying colours and I was offered a scholarship to study business administration in India, where I excelled and was later employed by Trade Kings as a managing director .
Even though I have been given employement I didn't stop working hard because I want to achieve more in life.
 In conclusion I want to encourage everyone be confident, work hard to get what you want and never give up
