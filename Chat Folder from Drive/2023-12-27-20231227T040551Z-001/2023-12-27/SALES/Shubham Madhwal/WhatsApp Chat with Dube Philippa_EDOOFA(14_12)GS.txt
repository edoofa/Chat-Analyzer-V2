15/12/23, 8:01 am - +44 7471 343192: Mr Gurvinder, hope we find you well
15/12/23, 9:56 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Nodumo, and Mr Dube,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
15/12/23, 9:57 am - +263 78 313 4116: Oky noted sir
15/12/23, 10:46 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Mr Dube, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Adrian, is that correct?
15/12/23, 10:47 am - +44 7471 343192: My daughter did
15/12/23, 10:50 am - +263 78 313 4116: Actually I'm the one who got to know about the scholarship program from Adrian sir
15/12/23, 12:16 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Adrian, also do tell me whether you learnt about Adrian’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
15/12/23, 12:20 pm - +263 78 313 4116: Oky so Adrian had told us about how edoofa helps out learners from all around the world.....he also informed us about the earn while you learn programs that edoofa offers .........I'm afraid he had not informed us much about his journey and experience with the edoofa program but he did say that it is a program that believes that every student should get the opportunity to get better education
15/12/23, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program myself.
15/12/23, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
15/12/23, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
15/12/23, 1:00 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
15/12/23, 1:00 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
15/12/23, 1:04 pm - +263 78 313 4116: Oky noted sir
15/12/23, 1:05 pm - +263 78 313 4116: Thank you for briefing me
15/12/23, 1:44 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Nodumo, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
15/12/23, 1:46 pm - +263 78 313 4116: I believe I have what it takes to meet with the two significant metrics and to also get a higher quantum of the scholarship
15/12/23, 2:31 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
15/12/23, 2:31 pm - Gurvinder: Now Noduma, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?

5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?

7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?

The values they hold, like helping others and being involved in the community, might be similar to what you find in social work.

18/12/23, 1:00 pm - Gurvinder: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals is B.A. (Hons.) in Sociology! This program offers a robust understanding of societal structures, human behavior, and the dynamics that shape our communities. It forms an ideal platform for those aspiring to excel in the field of social work.

With a solid grounding in sociology, you'll delve into crucial aspects like social justice, diversity, inequality, and the complexities of human relationships. These insights become invaluable when engaging with diverse populations, understanding societal needs, and addressing various social issues prevalent in our communities.

Moreover, combining your sociology background with a passion for social work can create a powerful synergy. It equips you to analyze social problems critically, implement intervention strategies effectively, and advocate for positive change within communities.

Upon completion, you'll possess a comprehensive understanding of societal structures and human behavior, enabling you to make meaningful contributions as a social worker. Are you excited about using your sociology expertise to drive impactful change and assist communities through social work?"
18/12/23, 1:10 pm - +263 78 313 4116: Yes I'm excited
18/12/23, 1:21 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
18/12/23, 1:21 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
18/12/23, 1:27 pm - +263 78 313 4116: Im confident
18/12/23, 1:51 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course more?
18/12/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 313 4116: Yes please do sir
18/12/23, 2:12 pm - Gurvinder: *B.A. (Hons.) in Sociology* is an undergraduate program that deals with various aspects of social behavior and its consequence on modern society. Sociology is a branch of study which investigates multiple aspects of society and social behavior which helps them to do social work. A Bachelor's degree in Sociology teaches the fundamental concepts related to the structure of society, organization of society, and how humans interact within these constructs. The basic subject matter of Sociology concerns itself with topics related to family structure, global warfare, religious cults, social class, race, and gender, etc.
18/12/23, 2:12 pm - Gurvinder: This program provides you with an understanding of core traditions and contemporary developments in sociological thinking and research. The theories and methods we explore enable us to examine the character and workings of the social institutions that govern people’s lives and encourage us to critically question the social values we live by. This program provides you with an understanding of core traditions and contemporary developments in sociological thinking and research. The theories and methods we explore enable us to examine the character and workings of the social institutions that govern people’s lives, and encourage us to critically question the social values we live by.
18/12/23, 2:12 pm - Gurvinder: This degree course enables the students to go for various Sociology related jobs such as in industry, commerce, the NHS, education authorities, further and higher education, and charitable, counseling, and voluntary organizations.
One can go for higher degree programs in respective subjects for further research work in Sociology.

Opportunities also exist for sociology graduates in the civil service and graduate management training schemes. Sociology graduates work with a varied and diverse client group during the course of their career.

*Bachelor of Arts in Sociology* includes a number of compulsory subjects. Along with that, the students will also have to choose from a number of elective subjects. The elective subjects may differ from college to college.
18/12/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 313 4116: Thank you .....so if I may ask which are the subjects needed for one to study this course
18/12/23, 2:32 pm - Gurvinder: Noduma, I have offered you this course as you are already eligible to pursue it, this is the only eligibility criteria that you have to keep in your mind.
18/12/23, 2:33 pm - +263 78 313 4116: I understand sir .....I think it's an interesting course actually
18/12/23, 2:39 pm - Gurvinder: Did you understand the course?
18/12/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 313 4116: Yes i understood it
18/12/23, 2:43 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
18/12/23, 2:56 pm - +263 78 313 4116: Well since I said my wish is to help someone I believe if I'm offered this course it would help me make a difference in someone's life and to me also cause it would have me know how to tackle certain problems .....if I'm to get into the edoofa program it would enable me in achieve my dreams because I believe once I'm in the program I would be motivated to do better and to be come the person I have always wanted to be
18/12/23, 3:01 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Noduma, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
18/12/23, 3:03 pm - +263 78 313 4116: I'm more than willing to give 200% of my hard work and take all the opportunities that are to come my way
18/12/23, 3:12 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
18/12/23, 3:20 pm - +263 78 313 4116: Well studying in Zimbabwe would have been  lovely honestly but with the current financial crisis in Zimbabwe it's not that much of an option and I believe if I'm to study abroad it would be easier for me to achieve my goals as they are better living conditions and all that ...... basically I think studying abroad is a plus one for people like me cause apparently in Zimbabwe we have a number of graduate who fail to get proper jobs or should I say have failed doing the things they learnt for with that I may say studying abroad would make a difference to a young African child like myself
18/12/23, 3:29 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
18/12/23, 3:38 pm - +263 78 313 4116: I'm planning on contributing my learnings from abroad to the development of my country's education system by sharing with my people how things are done abroad and what I think can be done to improve our learning institutions......I don't doubt the fact that Zimbabwe is a beautiful country and yet a blessed one to but to be honest we as Zimbabwe lack people who impress us into bettering our country I believe if I'm given the chance I can make the difference
18/12/23, 4:11 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Noduma, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
18/12/23, 4:16 pm - +263 78 313 4116: I agree
18/12/23, 4:28 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
18/12/23, 4:30 pm - +263 78 313 4116: Yah why is that so
18/12/23, 4:35 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

*Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

18/12/23, 4:44 pm - +263 78 313 4116: Wow I think I understand now why edoofa recommens  india
18/12/23, 4:58 pm - Gurvinder: So now Nodumo, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
18/12/23, 5:01 pm - +263 78 313 4116: No I don't have an asks so far I think I understand
18/12/23, 5:01 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
18/12/23, 5:02 pm - +44 7471 343192: Very enlightening stuff today , your chat flowed
18/12/23, 5:03 pm - +263 78 313 4116: Im afraid we are not familiar with that
18/12/23, 5:19 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
18/12/23, 5:19 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
18/12/23, 5:19 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
18/12/23, 5:19 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 5:19 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
18/12/23, 5:21 pm - +44 7471 343192: Sounds good
18/12/23, 5:22 pm - +263 78 313 4116: Oky that's nice
18/12/23, 5:29 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
18/12/23, 5:30 pm - +263 78 313 4116: Yes please do
18/12/23, 5:31 pm - Gurvinder: Nodumo, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
18/12/23, 5:35 pm - +263 78 313 4116: I understand
18/12/23, 5:38 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
18/12/23, 5:38 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
18/12/23, 5:38 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*
_How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer!_ by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu*
_It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship_ by *Mr. Ronard Kachaje*

18/12/23, 5:38 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
18/12/23, 5:41 pm - +263 78 313 4116: I believe this will definitely help me
18/12/23, 5:57 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Nodumo, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
18/12/23, 6:03 pm - +263 78 313 4116: Oky noted sir
18/12/23, 6:07 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

18/12/23, 6:07 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
18/12/23, 6:10 pm - +263 78 313 4116: Correct that's what I have been looking for
18/12/23, 6:10 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Noduma, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
18/12/23, 6:11 pm - +263 78 313 4116: Yes they are the ones who would be supporting me
18/12/23, 6:12 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
18/12/23, 6:40 pm - +263 78 313 4116: Yes I did discuss all that with them
18/12/23, 6:41 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
18/12/23, 6:42 pm - +263 78 313 4116: Yes I am ready
18/12/23, 6:43 pm - Gurvinder: Nodumo as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
18/12/23, 6:47 pm - +263 78 313 4116: They would spend approximately $2450
18/12/23, 6:51 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Nodumo, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
18/12/23, 6:52 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 6:52 pm - +263 78 313 4116: Oky
18/12/23, 6:53 pm - +263 78 313 4116: That's great
18/12/23, 6:54 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
18/12/23, 6:55 pm - +263 78 313 4116: I agree
18/12/23, 6:57 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
18/12/23, 6:57 pm - Gurvinder: Nodumo basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
18/12/23, 6:57 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
18/12/23, 6:59 pm - +263 78 313 4116: Noted
18/12/23, 6:59 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
18/12/23, 7:00 pm - +263 78 313 4116: The 5's ??
18/12/23, 7:03 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 7:03 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Nodumo, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself. <This message was edited>
18/12/23, 7:03 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
18/12/23, 7:05 pm - +263 78 313 4116: I understood Mr Gurvinder
18/12/23, 7:06 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
18/12/23, 7:06 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
18/12/23, 7:06 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
18/12/23, 7:07 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
18/12/23, 7:08 pm - +263 78 313 4116: I think I understood everything
18/12/23, 7:09 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
18/12/23, 7:09 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
18/12/23, 7:09 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

 *Life in Rwanda 16 years after  the  genocide there* 

Life in Rwanda after the genocide was not as lovely as it was as they had people who were suffering from depression and countless survivors developed long term psychological problem ,a number of children became orphaned,a number of women were raped and abused and had to heal from all these things not forgetting the economy of Rwanda was not stable after the genocide.....Rwanda suffered dearly in order to get back to the state they were once at 

With the above stated on going problems in Rwanda is it easy for one to say Rwanda had a bad experience during the genocide.The issue of raped women and children is one serious matters as some of them may have been left with STI's and some of them suffered even facing other people in the community.

The economy of a country is one major thing a country realises on and with a dead economy in Rwanda it is easy for one to say that these people may have had serious cases of people starving to death.

Not only the economy was damaged but the facilities in Rwanda these people had to rebuild their country all over again and with a dead economy it was hard for them to have to get raw material imported into their country

In conclusion one may say Rwanda had it really bad and it took a lot for them to be where they're today.

 *My inspiration story*

Well when it comes to being inspired I take it from the people I live with both at home and in my community..... Growing up in a country like Zimbabwe is not an easy thing honestly but everyday when we wake up and try building a name for ourselves we are told to go out there and show them who we are and what we are made of those words alone can make a child want to do more and be better than they were yesterday......yes we have people like Ellon Masks and Bill Gates who have inspired almost half of the world into working hard but I personally got my inspiration from my people,my grandma alway says "learn and be someone in life and take good care of us when you are older"hearing those words from an old lady who has ran her race for a long tym now helps remind me that I can be better and I can become better than I was a few days ago or even a few seconds ago..
20/12/23, 6:59 pm - +44 7471 343192: Thank you for your letter Program Director.

I am encouraged to know of the support my child is getting and will continue to get from Edoofa in their journey to attaining a world class education. As a family we have an obligation to support her through it all.
We are to treat her and give her space to exercise her choices and freedom in her chosen field.Should she wish to take another direction in her course we will respect and help her with that choice.
Being someone who travelled extensively, I understand the challenges of being in a foreign country.And to that effect as a family we will avail ourselves as she journeys through her study and stay in India.

And we are glad and hopeful that your institution will have a great support system for her if indeed she makes the grade.

I thank you.

I am Mr Shubham, Senior Academician at Edoofa

I have been evaluating your responses in the counselling session with your counsellor.

*Are we good to proceed with your evaluation now?*
23/12/23, 9:42 am - +263 78 313 4116: Yes we are
23/12/23, 9:59 am - +44 7471 343192: Good morning everyone
23/12/23, 10:28 am - Shubham Madhwal: so how was your session with the program director?
23/12/23, 10:29 am - +44 7471 343192: Enlightening, though we have some grey areas
23/12/23, 10:31 am - +263 78 313 4116: It was interesting
23/12/23, 10:43 am - Shubham Madhwal: So the Program Director Mr Abhinav updated me that you wanted to discuss with your family yesterday, May I know if you managed to do that and how did the discussion go?
23/12/23, 11:35 am - +44 7471 343192: My apologies Shubham on our late response. Note that in my earlier response I alluded to grey areas, we need clarity on a few points.
To start with , we acknowledge that for our child to attain an education, though with sponsorship we will be expected to fork out something.It is the something that we are not sure about. For me the whole process was more like vetting, vetting to find Nodumo’s eligibility(1) and if eligible what scholarship she qualifies for(2).
My understanding, correct me if I’m wrong , was that there is a fully funded scholarship (100%) and a partial scholarship (around 50%). And the whole interview was to determine my child’s eligibility for the program and if she does, under which scholarship.

Can I have clarity on these issues please.I thank you
23/12/23, 11:47 am - Shubham Madhwal: Please I was not able to understand your question!
23/12/23, 11:53 am - +44 7471 343192: What’s included in your scholarship, how do we get a full scholarship
23/12/23, 11:54 am - +44 7471 343192: Yesterday we were made to understand that we will have costs to cover, can you outline it all
23/12/23, 12:30 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You can get a 50-100% scholarship on tuition fees. 50 % being an assured one if you manage to become an Edoofa Enrollment. And to get a 100% scholarship you have to have a good academic and co-curricular record with strong SOP, merit, work experience and recommendation from edoofa. We will be discussing about the fees in our session ahead in detail!
23/12/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 313 4116: Oky noted
