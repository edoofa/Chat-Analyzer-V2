10/11/23, 11:09 am - Kunal: Thank you for sharing
10/11/23, 11:09 am - Kunal: I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
10/11/23, 12:11 pm - Kunal: Are we connected?
10/11/23, 12:31 pm - Kunal: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 1:30 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenge with the schedule.
