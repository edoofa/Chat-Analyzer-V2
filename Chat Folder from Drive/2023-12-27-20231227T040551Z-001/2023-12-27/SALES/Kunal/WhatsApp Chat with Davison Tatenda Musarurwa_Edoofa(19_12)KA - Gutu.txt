I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about him achieving it
26/12/23, 3:23 pm - +263 71 481 7854: Yes iam
26/12/23, 3:28 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
May I know his subjects of A level?
26/12/23, 3:32 pm - +263 71 481 7854: Biology, Geography, Agriculture
26/12/23, 3:42 pm - Kunal: Noted
May I know with his interests towards Medical field, why didn't he opt for science subjects?
26/12/23, 3:55 pm - +263 71 481 7854: He didn't get A or B in some subjects
26/12/23, 3:57 pm - Kunal: Alright, let me tell you that since he is not having science subjects at A level, he is not eligible for the Medical field
At the same time, may I know he is having any alternate career aspirations?
26/12/23, 4:21 pm - Kunal: Let us connect at *9:30 am CAT Tomorrow to resume your session *(In case you have any challenges, please let me know the time you will be available, and we will schedule accordingly)*

Please note that your participation and activeness is an important parameters of evaluation.
