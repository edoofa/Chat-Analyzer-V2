17/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 545 8959: Gud afternoon Mr Kunal.Let me describe myself . I'm a girl aged 19 doing Lower six sciences.I do pure mathematics, statistics, physics and chemistry .I would like to be an aircraft engineer.Am doing my A level at First Class Academy in Mutare and that's also where I did my O level.I live with my mother and my two siblings (brother aged 23 and a young sister 15).I do athletics and am also talented in women's soccer.My mother pays my school fees.
17/11/23, 2:10 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear and learn more about you. I am really happy that you expressed yourself genuinely.

May I know how much was your school fee?
17/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 545 8959: 185 per term
17/11/23, 3:03 pm - Kunal: Noted dear
I hope you are aware that studying abroad involves a financial aspect. May I know who will support you financially with your education abroad?
17/11/23, 3:04 pm - +263 78 545 8959: My mom
17/11/23, 3:19 pm - Kunal: Thank you for sharing
So, may I know what fascinated you about pursuing a course and career in aircraft engineering?
17/11/23, 3:22 pm - +263 78 545 8959: I don't really know but am good at repairing electrical gadgets so I think that's what fascinated me
17/11/23, 3:41 pm - Kunal: That is fine
So, to take forward your evaluation, I would now like you to share with me your previous qualification results i.e. O level results, please?
A picture would be better
17/11/23, 3:50 pm - +263 78 545 8959: U consider O level results not A level?
17/11/23, 4:01 pm - Kunal: We consider A-level results, please
17/11/23, 4:01 pm - Kunal: I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
17/11/23, 4:02 pm - +263 78 545 8959: Ooh oky fine
17/11/23, 4:02 pm - +263 78 545 8959: Noted
17/11/23, 4:09 pm - Kunal: Please share it
17/11/23, 4:29 pm - +263 78 545 8959: Oky I will send
17/11/23, 6:12 pm - Kunal: Let us connect at *9:00 am CAT Tomorrow to resume your session *(In case you have any challenges, please let me know the time you will be available, and we will schedule accordingly)*

Please note that your participation and activeness is an important parameter of evaluation. 

*In case the student is having lessons, the parents can also take part in the session*

Stay Blessed!
18/11/23, 9:12 am - Kunal: Good morning, everyone
How are you doing?
18/11/23, 9:16 am - +263 77 379 2844: If that is the case ziwanai in in L6 this yr
18/11/23, 9:28 am - Kunal: That is fine
I hope you are confident about him achieving it
18/11/23, 10:37 am - +263 78 545 8959: ...
18/11/23, 10:49 am - Kunal: Let me tell you
Looking at your interests and passion for aerosplanes and aeronautics, let me share with you that we do offer *Aerospace Engineering* but as your counselor I would like to highlight a few parameters

-This is a niche course that has a higher cost of education compared to other branches of engineering and the quantum of scholarship offered is low

- If you opt for this branch, your scope of career opportunities will be confined to the branch of Aerospace/Aeronautical itself. At the same time if you opt for a degree like *Mechanical Engineering*, it can help to bridge you to Aeronautical, Aerospace, Automotive, etc at the same time helps to fulfill your interests in solving challenges, to bring innovations, and at the same time offering a wider spectrum of career opportunities as Mechanical Engineering is known as the mother of Engineering!

So, shall I explain *Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering* in depth?
18/11/23, 7:14 pm - Kunal: I wanted to inform you all that I will be unavailable for a few days due to a workshop
Please note that we will be connecting at *11:00 am CAT Thursday (07/12/23) to resume your session *(In case you have any challenges, please let me know the time you will be available, and we will schedule accordingly)*

Stay Blessed!
