16/11/23, 5:56 pm - +263 77 291 5241: Ok and how much does that cost
16/11/23, 6:19 pm - Kunal: If you understand the concept of International Education, the finances that play a major role is not visa fee or flight ticket because visa fee is given once in the whole program and the flight ticket is taken a limited number of times,maybe twice or once,because international students don't often travel back to their country.

They look forward to settling down and making sure education is not hampered.So they learn and do internships at breaks.But still students can definitely visit their family during holidays and spend time with them.

But I personally have seen that students don't travel often,so considering these the traveling fee
*(air fare :-around $400,Visa fee:-$83) is to be borne by the student* which is mostly a one time investment.
16/11/23, 7:13 pm - +263 77 291 5241: Ok l understand completely
16/11/23, 7:13 pm - +263 77 291 5241: This message was deleted

However, in case you come across any of your friends or family members who would like to study abroad for their higher education, please share the following document with them and ask them to read it. After reading if they wish to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, you can share my number and ask them to fill out the application form and share the filled application with me.
