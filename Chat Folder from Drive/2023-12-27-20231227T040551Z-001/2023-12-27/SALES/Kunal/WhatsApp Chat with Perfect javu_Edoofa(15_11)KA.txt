16/11/23, 4:57 pm - Kunal: As per the protocols of the program,the representation of your parents/guardians who will be supporting your education is necessary in the group so that they can follow the sessions and I can address their thoughts and queries directly. As you know higher education is a big decision that requires the support of your family. *So shall we add them to the group?*

In case they are not available right now, they can still be the part of a group and catch up with the conversations later
16/11/23, 5:19 pm - +263 71 708 0519: Ahhh it's unfortunate that my parent (mother) we can't add her in the group as she doesn't have WhatsApp but obviously she knows and she will be part of every process
16/11/23, 5:37 pm - Kunal: In that case would you like to add any of your close supportive family members to represent your family?
16/11/23, 6:00 pm - +263 71 708 0519: Yeah I think I can add some
16/11/23, 6:01 pm - Kunal: May I know whom do you wish to add?
16/11/23, 6:01 pm - +263 71 708 0519: 2 contacts.vcf (file attached)
16/11/23, 6:01 pm - +263 71 708 0519: Think you can add them

08/12/23, 12:46 pm - Kunal: Greetings to you all

I am here to resume with our session and proceed with your application
May I know if you are available for the session?
23/12/23, 9:21 am - Kunal: Greetings to you all

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.

*Please Note by tomorrow*, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply
26/12/23, 1:09 pm - Kunal: Greetings everyone
We have been expecting your responses and participation in the session.

We are putting a formal closure to your application. Feel free to re-apply when you are ready to come to India for your higher education. However, in case you come across any of your friends or family members who would like to study abroad for their higher education, please share the following document with them and ask them to read it. After reading if they wish to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, you can share my number and ask them to fill out the application form and share the filled application with me.
