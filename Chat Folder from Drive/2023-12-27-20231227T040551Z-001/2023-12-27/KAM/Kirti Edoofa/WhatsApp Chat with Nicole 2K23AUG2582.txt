19/12/23, 12:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Nicole.

I hope this message finds you well. Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you yesterday as I was occupied with a work meeting and my schedule was really packed. However, we can connect now so may I know if you are available to connect with us now?

19/12/23, 6:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, thank you for asking, I am doing great kindly excuse me I was not available that time since it was my dinner break however, we can connect now.
19/12/23, 6:55 PM - +27 78 844 5287: Connected
19/12/23, 7:23 PM - +263 78 056 8487: We are available now sir.
19/12/23, 7:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now I was able to have a discussion with the academic board, and they did understand the situation you are in, however, to even abide by the university deadline and not miss out on the Endowment program the board suggested that you pay at least a $100 this by the 29th of December, the $171 on or before 29th January and the last installment of $170 on or before 28th of February.
19/12/23, 7:40 PM - +27 78 844 5287: Good evening mma, I will try my best but if failed to pay please just refund University money truely I don't have money, This month I did took Nicole s passport  and she need money transport so to be surely and onest I won't, that's why I don't want to give you my burdens to carry them they are heavy for you, so if failed to pay I am requesting money back for University then for registration it's fine there is nothing I can do, I can't get loan nothing.

So I was thinking failed to do so she will just attend the near University were I can afford to do so, I was wishing her best in Edoofa but money problem, and also its too much for me especially January it's about fees and stationary so it's really tough for me.

Hope you find this in order.
19/12/23, 7:42 PM - +263 78 056 8487: Things are really tough for my mom.
19/12/23, 7:43 PM - +263 78 056 8487: Is the registration fee for the university refundable sir?

Because you clearly stated that the enrollment fee is not refundable.
19/12/23, 7:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am sorry, but a refund in this case will not be possible, I am sure you must be aware of the refund policy if not let me reiterate it. A refund is only possible when we as an organization fail to provide you with an offer letter, however, that is not the case here. Instead of thinking about a refund let us discuss and come up with a solution, when I am here to give my full assistance I will require the same effort from you as well.
19/12/23, 7:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand the concern you have shared above @27788445287 in that case, for me to assist you better, could you please help me understand how much will you be able to raise by 29th December?
19/12/23, 7:57 PM - +27 78 844 5287: I can't promise failed to pay 29 Dec you may take the money no choice I truely suffered to pay it.
19/12/23, 8:04 PM - +27 78 844 5287: I tried my effort and I even merchain the dates that I will pay but still it can't work for you, only that you need money your money Dec, failed to do so take the whole money I suffered for it,yes registration you can take but the University money why not refundable because University starts Aug or Sept why?
20/12/23, 8:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Nicole.

I hope you are doing well. Kindly excuse me for not getting back to you yesterday I was occupied in a work call and hence could you respond, coming back to your concern shared above ma'am I completely understand your concern and I am here willing to assist you and I understand that in December you are not sure about the payment and that is why I wish to ask you how much will you be able to raise by 29th of December, your honest answer will help me to assist you with a more flexible payment plan?
21/12/23, 6:53 AM - +27 78 844 5287: Good morning? Hope you are doing well.

Let me try to find someone that can borrow me give me today and toomorow I will come back to you before Monday.

Thank you.
21/12/23, 9:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you are doing well.

thank you for asking, I am doing great. Surely I will connect with you on Saturday so that we can discuss a way forward. Have a blessed evening ahead.
22/12/23, 6:53 AM - +27 78 844 5287: 👏👏
26/12/23, 4:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Nicole.

I hope you are doing well and had a delightful Christmas celebration. Since we were unable to continue with our discussion on Saturday may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can move ahead with our discussion?
26/12/23, 6:40 PM - +263 78 056 8487: Yes we are available.
26/12/23, 6:41 PM - +27 78 844 5287: Good afternoon? Hope you are doing well. I am available
26/12/23, 7:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, thank you for asking, I am doing great. I am glad to know that we can connect now. I was able to go through your message above. I certainly understand your concern, however, January will be a long time, since the universities have to be fair with all the students. I can have a conversation with the university and help you process your admission as a regular application by 30th January, but that would mean letting go of the Endowment Grant of $150, and you will need to deposit $750. If you are okay with this, I can certainly take another step to help you out. However, I am here willing to help you so that you do not even lose on the endowment benefits, so let me know if you wish to know more about it?
26/12/23, 7:15 PM - +263 78 056 8487: Yes we wish to know more about.
26/12/23, 7:15 PM - +27 78 844 5287: We wish to know more about this
26/12/23, 7:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Considering you've brought this concern to our attention and discussed them always transparently, I believe we can discuss the matter with university officials to explore a solution that prevents Nicole from missing out on this valuable scholarship opportunity. This scholarship serves as the initial stepping stone for her to access higher-quality education and pave the way for a successful career. <This message was edited>
26/12/23, 7:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To assist you effectively, I would appreciate a more detailed understanding of your situation. This will enable us to align your needs with the university's policies and find a suitable solution. For me to understand your situation better here, I would like to understand how much have you raised so far and will be able to raise till the 28th of December?
26/12/23, 8:37 PM - +263 78 056 8487: We agree on processing as a regular application by 30th January and paying $750.

But the money we paid so far will be included right?
26/12/23, 8:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, it will be included. Thank you for letting me know about your decision. However, may I know if you are sure letting go of the Endowment benefits?
26/12/23, 9:06 PM - +263 78 056 8487: We really have no option do we...
26/12/23, 9:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263780568487 I realize your options are limited at this moment, but I'm reaching out to inquire if it's feasible for you to contribute $80 or $100 for your seat. By managing this, I can ensure that your endowment benefits are secured. As your admission officer, it's important for me to find a plan that works for you, as I truly don't want you to miss out on these benefits. Your contribution is essential in this process, and I'm here to assist you in every way possible.
26/12/23, 9:28 PM - +263 78 056 8487: Isn't the small amount of money that we already paid enough to secure a seat for me?
26/12/23, 10:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263780568487 for your assistance I shall have a discussion again with the team, and I shall let you know the final updates tomorrow same time in the evening. I hope you will be available. Have a blessed night.
26/12/23, 10:07 PM - +263 78 056 8487: Same to you.
