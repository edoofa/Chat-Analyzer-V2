26/12/23, 6:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
26/12/23, 6:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
26/12/23, 6:24 PM - +267 74 197 595: Yes l agree
26/12/23, 6:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
26/12/23, 6:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
26/12/23, 6:26 PM - +267 74 197 595: The exams were already written in November 2023 and we are waiting for the results that will be out early February 2024
26/12/23, 6:27 PM - +267 74 197 595: So there is no reappearance
26/12/23, 6:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand. *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
26/12/23, 6:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
26/12/23, 6:34 PM - +267 74 197 595: Yes l m clear
26/12/23, 6:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
26/12/23, 6:41 PM - +267 74 197 595: I m understanding point 1 and 2
26/12/23, 6:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/12/23, 6:46 PM - +267 74 197 595: I have no queries
26/12/23, 6:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As Nyashadzashe's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that he is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
26/12/23, 6:48 PM - +267 74 197 595: Yes
26/12/23, 6:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day evening and please extend our regards to your family as well. We will only be able to share your application with the universities when you will be able to share your letter of recommendation or the statement of entry for A level
26/12/23, 6:52 PM - +267 74 197 595: Thank you
26/12/23, 6:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, may I know by when will you be able to share the remaining documents?
26/12/23, 6:57 PM - +263 77 575 2913: We haven't heard any response from the school authorities
26/12/23, 7:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, in that case, may I know when are you planning to connect with them again?
26/12/23, 7:10 PM - +267 74 197 595: As soon as they are available we will share with you
26/12/23, 7:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. I understand however, I would suggest you be proactive here so that the delay in document may not affect his application process.
26/12/23, 9:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I was expecting to hear back from you, but as there hasn't been a response and given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
