26/12/23, 6:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Ruth.

I hope you are doing well and had a delightful Christmas celebration. Since we were unable to continue with our discussion, I wanted to reach out and check if you are available to connect with us now so that we can move ahead with our discussion?
26/12/23, 6:22 PM - +263 77 598 7016: Good evening ma'am
Yes I am available
I hope you had a wonderful holiday
26/12/23, 6:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I had a wonderful holiday. I hope the same for you and it is good to know that we can connect now. May I know if you were able to have a discussion with your parents about our previous conversation over the weekend? <This message was edited>
26/12/23, 9:45 PM - +263 77 598 7016: Yes I did
26/12/23, 9:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I was expecting to hear back from you earlier, but as there hasn't been a response that time and given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.

Good night
