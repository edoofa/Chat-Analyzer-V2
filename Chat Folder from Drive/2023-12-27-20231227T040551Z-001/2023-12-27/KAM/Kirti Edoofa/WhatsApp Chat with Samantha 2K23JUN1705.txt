I hope this message finds you well. I have been anticipating your response for the past week and we have not been able to have a conversation. I could not help but notice that you were able to go through the message I shared above. So I would like to understand if you are having some challenges that are holding you back from communicating with us because your inactivity is giving a negative impression on your scholarship application because you have already received an offer letter the university officials are also getting a negative impression that you are not serious about the scholarship offered.

I hope you are doing well. I am sorry to hear about that, may I know how are you doing now?
