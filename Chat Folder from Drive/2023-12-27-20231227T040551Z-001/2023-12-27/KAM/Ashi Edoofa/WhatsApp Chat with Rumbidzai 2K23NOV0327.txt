20/12/23, 1:39 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, dear parent and my dear student!

I would like to share an update with you: starting today, I will no longer be serving as your admission officer. I wanted to inform you that Ms. Ashi will be taking over from now on, and she will be reaching out to you very soon.

Over the past 12 months, I have had the privilege of serving as the admission officer for you and many other students. It has been a great experience getting to know the potential of my students and spending valuable time discussing their aspirations. However, every journey has its end, and now it's time for me to embark on a new chapter.

Rest assured, the exceptional service and support you have received will continue seamlessly as Ms. Ashi, one of our accomplished admission officers, takes over your admission journey from this point forward. I wish you the very best on your journey. Goodbye, my dear student.

Yours sincerely,
Mr. Shivjeet
Admission Officer
20/12/23, 1:43 PM - +263 78 867 1027: Thank you so much Mr Shivjeet for your support much appreciated, also thank you for updating me on this issue.
26/12/23, 2:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Rumbidzai ,

In light of the conversation we had earlier, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you are ready for the discussion today. I am here at the scheduled time to have a discussion about your academic journey futher. With this said, May I know if you are available for the conversation ?

I am eagerly waiting for your response.
26/12/23, 2:02 PM - +263 78 867 1027: Good Afternoon Ms. Ashi hope you are doing well.
26/12/23, 2:03 PM - +263 78 867 1027: We can start with our session now I'm ready
26/12/23, 2:04 PM - +263 77 170 2406: Good day how are you doing over there
26/12/23, 2:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am fine thank you. May I know if you remember the benefits shared by Mr. Shivjeet?
26/12/23, 2:34 PM - +263 78 867 1027: Yes I do remember them
26/12/23, 2:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that @263788671027, Let me share the third benefit with you.
26/12/23, 2:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3.*Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
26/12/23, 2:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/12/23, 2:52 PM - +263 78 867 1027: I understand that, it's clear and straight forward
26/12/23, 2:55 PM - +263 78 867 1027: Yes I understand
26/12/23, 3:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
26/12/23, 3:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
26/12/23, 3:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before December 30, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by January 30, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
26/12/23, 3:15 PM - +263 78 867 1027: No I don't have any queries everything is clear, I understand.
26/12/23, 3:16 PM - +263 78 867 1027: Noted
26/12/23, 3:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
26/12/23, 3:32 PM - +263 78 867 1027: No I'm not familiar about this please, you can assist me with more information about it.
26/12/23, 3:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
26/12/23, 3:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
26/12/23, 3:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
26/12/23, 3:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
26/12/23, 3:45 PM - +263 78 867 1027: Thanks for this information I'm following up
26/12/23, 3:45 PM - +263 78 867 1027: Understood
26/12/23, 3:47 PM - +263 78 867 1027: I understand everything about this, it's clear and straight forward
26/12/23, 3:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
26/12/23, 4:03 PM - +263 78 867 1027: Is that so?
26/12/23, 4:04 PM - +263 78 867 1027: This message was deleted
26/12/23, 4:08 PM - +263 78 867 1027: So in this case the student is supposed to re write the exams again
26/12/23, 4:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
26/12/23, 4:21 PM - +263 78 867 1027: Yes I agree
26/12/23, 4:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
26/12/23, 4:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
26/12/23, 4:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
26/12/23, 4:41 PM - +263 78 867 1027: I understand
26/12/23, 4:44 PM - +263 78 867 1027: We can proceed to the next one
26/12/23, 4:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
26/12/23, 4:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
26/12/23, 4:54 PM - +263 78 867 1027: This will be the best benefit
26/12/23, 4:54 PM - +263 78 867 1027: It's clear and straight forward
26/12/23, 4:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
26/12/23, 4:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
26/12/23, 5:02 PM - +263 78 867 1027: Well explained
26/12/23, 5:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/12/23, 5:08 PM - +263 78 867 1027: I don't have any querie, everything was understandable please
26/12/23, 5:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
26/12/23, 5:13 PM - +263 78 867 1027: Yes I'm so excited for that and that my wish to be part of the fortunate individual
26/12/23, 5:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
26/12/23, 5:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.
26/12/23, 5:26 PM - +263 78 867 1027: I understand the good support that you're giving me, I much appreciate that please.
26/12/23, 5:27 PM - +263 78 867 1027: I haven't shared my O level results with you yet so can I do that
26/12/23, 5:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes please dear, You can share all the documents with us
26/12/23, 5:39 PM - +263 78 867 1027: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 5:39 PM - +263 78 867 1027: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 5:40 PM - +263 78 867 1027: I have shared with you all my documents now
26/12/23, 5:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you so much @263788671027
26/12/23, 5:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: On that note, we will be bringing our today's conversation to a close. Wish you a blessed week ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.
26/12/23, 5:49 PM - +263 78 867 1027: Thank you Ms. Ashi for guiding me through the session today, have a great day ahead
26/12/23, 5:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome dear
