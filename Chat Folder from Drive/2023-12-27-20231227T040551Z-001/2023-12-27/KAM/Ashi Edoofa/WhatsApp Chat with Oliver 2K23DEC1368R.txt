If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
21/12/23, 2:14 PM - +263 77 618 3973: Welcome
21/12/23, 2:15 PM - +263 77 618 3973: I am ready
21/12/23, 2:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 2:21 PM - +263 77 618 3973: I am done sir
21/12/23, 2:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
21/12/23, 2:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
21/12/23, 2:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
21/12/23, 2:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear.
21/12/23, 2:31 PM - +263 77 618 3973: They are crystal clear sir
21/12/23, 2:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
21/12/23, 2:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
21/12/23, 2:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
21/12/23, 2:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
21/12/23, 2:36 PM - +263 77 618 3973: I am following sir
21/12/23, 2:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -
21/12/23, 2:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
21/12/23, 2:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
21/12/23, 2:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
21/12/23, 2:37 PM - +263 77 618 3973: Crystal clear sir
21/12/23, 2:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
21/12/23, 2:47 PM - +263 77 618 3973: Yes sir we can start
21/12/23, 2:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
21/12/23, 2:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
21/12/23, 2:54 PM - +263 77 618 3973: You can go ahead sir
21/12/23, 2:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Let me share the videos with you -

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
21/12/23, 3:12 PM - +263 77 618 3973: Right now my internet connection is kind of poor I haven't managed to even download the first video sir  but I am sure by tonight I will have downloaded all of them and managed to watch them and understand everything sir
21/12/23, 3:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, please. I would also like to reiterate that our operational hours are from 12:30 PM to 8:30 PM, Central African Time. 

Considering this, for our future sessions, you have to decide on an hour’s time that suits your availability within this timeframe and share the same with us so that we can tailor our subsequent sessions to accommodate your schedule effectively.
21/12/23, 3:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For the next couple of days, we will have sessions on a daily basis and once we cover the first three steps of the admission cycle, we will have sessions scheduled on need basis. Hence, can you let me know at what time will you like us to schedule our sessions on a daily basis (from 12:30 Pm to 08:30 PM)?
21/12/23, 3:14 PM - +263 77 618 3973: I think 17:00pm is fine sir
21/12/23, 3:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 05:00 pm for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to go through these videos. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed day and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
