21/12/23, 3:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
21/12/23, 3:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
21/12/23, 3:20 PM - +263 77 149 9307: 1.$350
2.$0
3.$1600
4.$125
5.$1000
21/12/23, 3:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 90% scholarship on tuition fees. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
21/12/23, 3:23 PM - +263 77 149 9307: We are excited for her but afraid that on our part this $1000 to secure the scholarship is still a lot
21/12/23, 3:24 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Considering as well the due date you gave
21/12/23, 3:25 PM - +263 77 149 9307: From the start we had been given a range of $500-$700
21/12/23, 3:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand @263771499307, I will definitely assist you here please don't worry.
21/12/23, 3:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
21/12/23, 3:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1600 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1850.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1600. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
21/12/23, 3:31 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Okay I understand so if I pay $1000 then $600 is left?
21/12/23, 3:32 PM - +263 77 149 9307: After reducing the cost of first year student what will become the annual fee
21/12/23, 3:32 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Aren't there other schools she got accepted so that we compare
21/12/23, 3:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263771499307 For the first year, the amount which is left after paying the registration fees will be $850. Regarding your concern about the other university, let me share that this is the first offer letter we have received for Mickelly please.
21/12/23, 3:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
21/12/23, 3:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make their education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
21/12/23, 3:37 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Okay let's continue
21/12/23, 3:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1600, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
21/12/23, 3:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
21/12/23, 3:40 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Okay
21/12/23, 3:41 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Okay
21/12/23, 3:41 PM - +263 77 149 9307: We understand but still the $1000 is a lot considering the due date. We won't be able to make it
21/12/23, 3:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263771499307 I understand your thoughts please don't worry as we have a flexible payment plan for you which will be shared with you shortly. At the moment can we go ahead with the discussion please?
21/12/23, 3:46 PM - +263 77 149 9307: That is okay
21/12/23, 3:47 PM - +263 77 149 9307: We can proceed
21/12/23, 3:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you @263771499307, Kindly don't worry we will definitely help you with your concern please.
21/12/23, 3:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $1600. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1600- $1000 = $600, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.

This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
21/12/23, 3:54 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Yes it does
21/12/23, 4:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
21/12/23, 4:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1850 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $850 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
21/12/23, 4:06 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Are you saying we are paying $1000 then fees that will be left is $850
21/12/23, 4:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct @263771499307. Now, I hope you recall that the per annum cost of education and the registration fee figures you mentioned were supposed to face a range of $2,000 to $3,000 for the annual cost of education and a registration fee between $500 and $1000.
21/12/23, 4:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, based on the discussions we had with your career counselor and their assessment of your application, they encouraged us to secure a higher quantum of scholarship for you. This is the reason the per annum cost of education is only $1600, which is significantly less than the general cost of education fee range ($2000 to $3000).
21/12/23, 4:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: When you look at this opportunity, with a higher quantum of scholarship, the registration fee may also appear a bit higher. Rest assured, this does not increase your financial burden, as it is an integral part of your first year of education cost and will be utilized for the same purpose. I hope this makes sense?
21/12/23, 4:25 PM - +263 77 149 9307: It makes sense but to me as a parent can't afford that much .Since you say it's her first offer letter  when can we expect some other offer letter from different universities so that we can reconsider .Noone will assist me to pay that figure $1850 for the first year ,in addition to that there is visa and a ticket to be paid .Maybe if we can get a university which need at least $350 to $500 to secure a scholarship .
21/12/23, 4:27 PM - +263 77 149 9307: That MVN university can't they reduce their admission fee and we pay the rest in instalments
21/12/23, 4:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand your thoughts @263771499307 and these are absolutely fine. I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for Mickelly is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that you will find a more affordable and high-quality education. 

Certainly, there are other universities that may assess your scholarship qualifications, and with those, the cost of education may fall within the specified range I mentioned earlier.
21/12/23, 4:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $850 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?
21/12/23, 4:50 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Yes l understand the whole story ,bt I'm a low income parent but lm sure there are other universities in India which offers reasonable fees annually bt still their registration fee will not be high like $1000.Civil servants in Zimbabwe earn $300 as a salary and step father of Mickely is the only bread winner in a family ,myself I'm not working .Mickelly have got siblings who need fees and so forth to survive.Parents at rural home needs help from us.Maybe if we can save $150 per month up to July that way l can starve .That $1000 can't be payable within 15 days .I don't know if you can negotiate for us to pay in instalments that $1000
21/12/23, 4:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concern with us, I appreciate your honesty. While I understand that you have challenges with the registration fees as you are thinking that the amount of $1000 for the registration fees is high. Is my understanding right?
21/12/23, 5:00 PM - +263 77 149 9307: $1000 to a civil servant in Zimbabwe is very high honestly speaking .
21/12/23, 5:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand @263771499307, I will definitely try my best to help you here.
21/12/23, 5:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as January 3rd, 2024*
21/12/23, 5:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
21/12/23, 5:05 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Yes sir you can go on.
21/12/23, 5:09 PM - +263 77 149 9307: $100 grant for endowment plan ,l know it bt still to me it makes no different because $900 it's still a lot
21/12/23, 5:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $900 of the registration fee. This $900 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$450 before the first deadline date of January 3rd, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$450 before the second deadline date of February 3rd, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
21/12/23, 5:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $900 within 15 working days, before *January 3rd, 2024* 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
21/12/23, 5:17 PM - +263 77 149 9307: My husband earns $300 ,at least if you say $450 first instalment in Feb and then the other $450 we pay in 2 instalments .You don't know how we struggled to pay enrolment fee .Things are not well in Zimbabwe.
21/12/23, 5:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand from where you are coming, and being your admission officer I will had a conversation with the university officials to tackle the financial challenges you're facing concerning the upcoming registration fee. Based on our records, the total amount required for your child's admission to the university is $900, with a $100 designated for enrollment, summing up to $1000.
21/12/23, 5:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In an effort to find a workable solution, I have been exploring the potential of establishing a payment plan. However, before finalizing this plan, it's important that we gain a comprehensive understanding of your current financial situation.
21/12/23, 5:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence, I wanted to understand the amount you've managed to set aside for your admission fee by the upcoming due date of *January 3rd, 2024*. This detailed information will empower us to tailor our assistance in the most effective and personalized manner possible.
21/12/23, 5:30 PM - +263 77 149 9307: First year annual fee it's a hard nut to crack ,maybe second year will be much better
21/12/23, 5:31 PM - +263 77 149 9307: $200
21/12/23, 5:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know @263771499307, While considering the current situation, May I kindly know when you will be able to pay the remaining amount?
21/12/23, 5:36 PM - +263 77 149 9307: I will manage to pay $250 by 3rd Feb and the other $450 will pay it in 2 instalments March and April
21/12/23, 5:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263771499307 I understand your situation, and will try my best to help you here. However, as you are aware that you have a benefit of $100 due to the Endowment benefits. With the above payment plan you have shared, you will end up completing the registration process by April and by this month the endowment benefits will be over hence, you might end up paying the complete registration fees which is $1000. Are you are okay with this, I can certainly take another step to help you out with the suggested payment plan by you.? <This message was edited>
21/12/23, 6:01 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Endowment benefits are entitled if l pay the registration fee in 1 month  is it so.What was the purpose of enrolment fee in this case ?
21/12/23, 6:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The enrollment fees is for the enrollment in Edoofa Scholarship Program please. Considering that Mickelly is a student under the Edoofa Program, and we have made a promise to help you secure your scholarship seat, we are always here to help you in such situation so that you can secure the scholarship seat. However, given that you have also been granted the Endowment Grant of $100, it might not be possible for you to extend the payment till April. We understand how the endowment benefits come into play and help you out. With that said, l would like to share an alternative with you. May I share the same with you?
21/12/23, 6:15 PM - +263 77 149 9307: You can share
21/12/23, 6:16 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Still endowment of $100 is very little considering the figure to be paid as admission fee .
21/12/23, 6:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me share the two options with you while considering the current situation. The first option is that you can skip the endowment benefits and can make the registration fees in the installment by the month of April.
21/12/23, 6:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The alternative option with the endowment benefit is that you can make the first installment of $200 by the deadline date of 3rd of January. The remaining amount of the registration fees which is $700 can be divided into 3 installment. For better understanding, let me share an example with you please -
21/12/23, 6:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. $250 can be paid by the end of January
2. $200 can be paid by the mid of February
3. $250 can be paid by the end of February
21/12/23, 6:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please do let me know what are your thoughts here.
21/12/23, 6:33 PM - +263 77 149 9307: This one can't manage where will l get the money to pay 2 instalments per month .We get 1 salary per month.Let me skip the endowment then l will  I will work with the instalments up to April
21/12/23, 6:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263771499307, I will discuss you concern with the team tomorrow in order to see if there is any other alternative we can help you with.
21/12/23, 6:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope that's okay?
21/12/23, 6:38 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Ok Sir ,this university is expensive ,l can't afford .Even those instalments up to April l will be starving with the whole family for me to pay all instalments .
21/12/23, 6:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263771499307 I was going through your application file and find that the cost of education range shared with you was $2000 to $3000. According to the offer letter, we share with you Mickelly's per annum cost of education is only $1600, which is significantly less than the general cost of education fee range ($2000 to $3000).
21/12/23, 6:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: May I know what are your expectations ?
21/12/23, 6:51 PM - +263 77 149 9307: I was expecting $1200 per year without scholarship or if it was $1600 without scholar ship it was better.Another option if it was $3000 per annum without scholarship then they offer that 90 percent it was better.MVN it's $5000 something without scholarship so it's demn expensive even if they offer 90 percent it seems there is no scholarship offered .
21/12/23, 6:53 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Someone from a loyal can afford that university not low income families
21/12/23, 7:00 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Five years it's a long , so try to help me with some institutes which are affordable
21/12/23, 7:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Let's reconnect tomorrow so that we can have a further discussion about your concerns in order to find a suitable solution.
21/12/23, 7:03 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Other universities without scholarship are paying that $1600 or $1200 so it should be less if they offer scholarship.
26/12/23, 4:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Mickelly !

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by MVN University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from MVN University as a collective?
26/12/23, 8:31 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Yes we did.
