I am here at the scheduled time to have a discussion about your admission journey futher. With this said, May I know if you are available for the conversation ?

I am eagerly waiting for your response.
26/12/23, 3:49 PM - +263 78 008 5885: Sorry for showing up late ma'am!
26/12/23, 3:49 PM - +263 78 008 5885: We can start our discussion.
26/12/23, 3:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries dear, I am glad to know that we can continue with the discussion now.
26/12/23, 3:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As you have mentioned that you will be able to pay $250 by 28th December and $200 by 10th of January, is my understanding right?
26/12/23, 4:00 PM - +263 78 008 5885: Yes ma'am it's True
26/12/23, 4:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation, on that note, please write a mail to "academicboard@edoofa.com" stating that you had a discussion with your admission officer Ms. Ashi about the cause of the delay in your registration fee and state the reason why and even mention the date and amount that you will be able to pay $250 before 28th November 2023 and $200 before 10th January 2024.

Please also mention your admission group name in the mail, once done share the screenshot with me.
26/12/23, 5:10 PM - +263 78 008 5885: Ok ma'am!
26/12/23, 5:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
26/12/23, 5:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
26/12/23, 5:16 PM - +263 78 008 5885: No lm in Mutare.
26/12/23, 5:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
26/12/23, 5:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
26/12/23, 5:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
26/12/23, 5:29 PM - +263 78 008 5885: Ok but is any other way, that will be very difficult for me because I do not have relatives in Harare or associates.
26/12/23, 5:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles Eco cash for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
26/12/23, 5:36 PM - +263 78 008 5885: Sure you can go ahead!
26/12/23, 5:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
26/12/23, 5:51 PM - +263 78 008 5885: Ok maam let me see what I can do!
26/12/23, 5:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @263780085885. Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
26/12/23, 5:53 PM - +263 78 008 5885: No queries!we can proceed
