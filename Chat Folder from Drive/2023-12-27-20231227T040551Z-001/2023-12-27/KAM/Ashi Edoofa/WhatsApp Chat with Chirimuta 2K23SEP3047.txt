19/12/23, 12:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Chirimuta,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
19/12/23, 12:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly. 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
19/12/23, 1:09 PM - +263 71 563 6867: We did go through the offer letter
19/12/23, 1:10 PM - +263 71 563 6867: Good afternoon sir
19/12/23, 1:10 PM - +263 71 563 6867: So the program fee, its 2450 per semester or yearly?
19/12/23, 1:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263715636867 We will discussing the same in the discussion today, As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.

The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
19/12/23, 1:23 PM - +263 71 563 6867: Ok sir  we can proceed
19/12/23, 1:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any queries you have. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
19/12/23, 1:32 PM - +263 71 563 6867: Its saying 1225 for the tuition fee
19/12/23, 1:36 PM - +263 71 563 6867: 2. Duration 4 years
3. Admission fee 200usd
4. Registration 700usd
19/12/23, 1:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 4-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 8 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $1225 making your per annum tuition fee ($1225*2) = $2450. Is that clear?
19/12/23, 1:44 PM - +263 71 563 6867: Without the hostel fee?
19/12/23, 1:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263715636867, Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -

*1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
19/12/23, 1:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
19/12/23, 1:59 PM - +263 78 396 5838: So how much is one suppose to pay per semester
19/12/23, 2:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263783965838 May I know for which accommodation are you asking for? <This message was edited>
19/12/23, 2:09 PM - +263 71 563 6867: l really wanted the university but the fees are high hence my parents won't afford
19/12/23, 2:14 PM - +263 71 563 6867: If there was an option for scholarship percentage increase or other better ones, it would be better
19/12/23, 2:17 PM - +263 78 396 5838: How is the 1225 per semester paid
19/12/23, 2:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand your concern dear, I would like to share that it is totally fine having these concerns. We understand that the cost of education at LPU University is not as per your expectations. Considering that LPU University is one of the best private universities in India that focuses more on branding and that is the reason they have good exposure for the students, however, it's a bit challenging for the parents to afford Higher Education at LPU.
19/12/23, 2:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263783965838 I am not able to understand your query please elaborate
19/12/23, 2:33 PM - +263 71 563 6867: Its okay, but is there any hope again for other offer letters or am now restricted to Gulzar now
19/12/23, 2:34 PM - +263 71 563 6867: As in,  is the maximum number of offer letters 2 or l might receive other ones in future
19/12/23, 2:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No Dear, There is no maximum number of offer letter for Edoofians however we have only received these two offer letters for you. If we receive any other offer letter for you we will definitely share it with you. For now, Can we move ahead with the discussion for the offer letter from LPU?
19/12/23, 2:44 PM - +263 71 563 6867: Ok sir, we can proceed
19/12/23, 2:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
19/12/23, 2:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and they would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?
19/12/23, 2:50 PM - +263 71 563 6867: Yes clear
19/12/23, 2:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
19/12/23, 2:53 PM - +263 78 396 5838: Yes
19/12/23, 2:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $700 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on January 1st, 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
19/12/23, 2:55 PM - +263 78 396 5838: Yes
19/12/23, 3:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. With this, your registration fees would be $550. I hope you understand?
19/12/23, 3:02 PM - +263 78 396 5838: Yes understood
19/12/23, 3:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this, Let me share a few insights into the university with you -
19/12/23, 3:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable. 

It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.
19/12/23, 3:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/

19/12/23, 3:38 PM - +263 78 396 5838: Thank you
19/12/23, 3:38 PM - +263 78 396 5838: And paying the 1225 is there a payment plan

19/12/23, 3:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, You will be given a flexible payment plan so that you can make the payment without any inconvenience
19/12/23, 3:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, I would also encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter from LPU with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by one of the top Indian universities and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on them on Thursday at 04:00 PM and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.
19/12/23, 3:44 PM - +263 78 396 5838: Thank you sir will surely do
19/12/23, 3:44 PM - +263 78 396 5838: So off campus how do u get in touch with other Edoofians who learn at LPU
19/12/23, 3:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263783965838 We will help you co-ordinate with them, moreover we have the DSW (Division of Student Welfare) team who will assist you further regarding off-campus accommodation.
19/12/23, 4:14 PM - +263 78 396 5838: Okay l understand
19/12/23, 4:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: On that note, we will be bringing our today's conversation to a close. Wish you a blessed week ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.
