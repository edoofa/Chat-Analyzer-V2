21/12/23, 2:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Sarah ,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
21/12/23, 2:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly. 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
21/12/23, 3:02 PM - +265 996 23 95 73: Good afternoon
21/12/23, 3:06 PM - +265 996 23 95 73: I have gone through the letter but I have to be frank that I am now scared and I am afraid because I don't even know if I will manage this  Does it mean the scholarship we are talking about here it's only about tuition? I have read in the letter that she has to pay  completely for her accommodations and food
21/12/23, 3:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @265996239573, I truly understand your thoughts however please don't be scared as I am here to assist you please. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.

The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
21/12/23, 3:14 PM - +265 996 23 95 73: Ok thanks, looking forward to your explanation
21/12/23, 3:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @265996239573. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
21/12/23, 3:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
21/12/23, 3:23 PM - +265 996 23 95 73: Tuition fee per semester after the scholarship is 900USD and the standard duration of the course is  4years ( 8 semester). Admission and procedure fee is 300 USD. The registration fee is 750 USD
21/12/23, 3:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a four-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 8 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
21/12/23, 3:27 PM - +265 996 23 95 73: For the tuition fee I have understood
21/12/23, 3:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
21/12/23, 3:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
21/12/23, 3:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
21/12/23, 3:34 PM - +265 996 23 95 73: Before we go further I would like to ask another question
21/12/23, 3:40 PM - +265 996 23 95 73: Before I paid the enrollment fee we had a discussion and in the discussion it was mentioned that once enrollment fee is paid another team will work hard to get my daughter admitted in one of the universities there and it was like two or three l universities will give us their offer and explain to us what they will offer us thereafter we can choose, was it not like that?
21/12/23, 3:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your query with me @265996239573, Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
21/12/23, 3:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
21/12/23, 3:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
21/12/23, 3:45 PM - +265 996 23 95 73: Loud and clear now
21/12/23, 3:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias University, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias University and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
21/12/23, 3:50 PM - +265 996 23 95 73: No am not
21/12/23, 3:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
21/12/23, 3:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias , the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
21/12/23, 3:59 PM - +265 996 23 95 73: It is clear though the registration fee is too much to me, I am looking at my financial status, I have struggled to get the enrollment fee paid and now registration fee and they're saying within 15 days, how am I going to manage this?
21/12/23, 4:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @265996239573 I can understand your thoughts please don't worry as we have a flexible payment plan which we will share with you shortly. For now, can we move ahead with the discussion please?
21/12/23, 4:05 PM - +265 996 23 95 73: Yes we can
21/12/23, 4:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
21/12/23, 4:17 PM - +265 996 23 95 73: Yes it is
21/12/23, 4:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
21/12/23, 4:21 PM - +265 996 23 95 73: Yes it's clear
21/12/23, 4:22 PM - +265 996 23 95 73: It is raining here and there is no electricity since morning so anytime my phone will shut down
21/12/23, 4:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @265996239573 Thank you for letting me know in advance. it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
21/12/23, 4:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on January 3rd, 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
21/12/23, 4:32 PM - +265 996 23 95 73: To say the truth I cannot manage to pay such a huge amount by 3rd January as you're aware that I have just finished paying the enrollment fee this week. Is there anyway that you can help me so that my daughter should not miss this opportunity?
21/12/23, 4:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I would love to assist you here @265996239573, In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
21/12/23, 8:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Sarah, As I was looking forward for your response, please do share your response with us. We will reconnect tomorrow at 3:00 pm so that we can help you with your concern, I hope you will be available for the discussion.
21/12/23, 8:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Have a good night ahead!
21/12/23, 8:44 PM - +265 987 57 92 74: Yes explain please
21/12/23, 8:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @265987579274 May I know if you want to continue the session now ?
21/12/23, 8:46 PM - +265 987 57 92 74: Sure
21/12/23, 8:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a student you will be responsible for the remaining $650 of the registration fee. This $650 can be conveniently paid in two instalments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$325 before the first deadline date of January 3rd, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$325 before the second deadline date of February 3rd, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
21/12/23, 8:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $650 within 15 working days, before *January 3rd, 2024* 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
21/12/23, 8:57 PM - +265 996 23 95 73: This is great,but is it not possible to pay the whole amount before the deadline of the subsequent payment?
21/12/23, 8:59 PM - +265 996 23 95 73: I am saying this because I know from now to month end of January I can manage to realize  that amount
21/12/23, 9:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @265996239573 I understand your thoughts, however you can either make the half payment before 3rd of January or complete payment before 3rd of January. May I know if there is any challenge ?
21/12/23, 9:03 PM - +265 996 23 95 73: Which means if I don't make half payment before 3rd January I am finished?
21/12/23, 9:07 PM - +265 996 23 95 73: Please have mercy on me today is 21st December 2023 they're just few days to reach 3rd January,
21/12/23, 9:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please don't worry @265996239573, I am here for you however I am not able to understand what is the challenge in making the payment before 3rd of Jan?
21/12/23, 9:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Could you please share what is the challenge ?
21/12/23, 9:09 PM - +265 996 23 95 73: The challenge is my source of income
21/12/23, 9:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand @265996239573, could you please explain further?
21/12/23, 9:12 PM - +265 996 23 95 73: Remember I am a primary school teacher my salary I below 200$. After getting my December salary I added to some savings I made and complete the enrollment fee, which means right now I have nothing in my account
21/12/23, 9:16 PM - +265 996 23 95 73: I was thinking that with my January salary and the intended money I can get after selling a piece of land  I can manage to pay complete before 3rd February 2024
21/12/23, 9:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I truly appreciate your efforts and dedication towards your child educational journey. Being your admission officer, I will do my best to assist you with your concern. To understand the situation better, I wanted to understand the amount you've managed to set aside for Sarah's admission fee by the upcoming due date of 3rd of January. This detailed information will empower us to tailor our assistance in the most effective and personalized manner possible.
22/12/23, 6:16 AM - +265 996 23 95 73: what I am saying is that right now I have reserved nothing for registration but I am hopeful that when the schools open I generate something which I will add on the money I will get after selling the land I said, that's why I said I can manage to make a complete payment before 3rd February because right now I completely have nothing
26/12/23, 4:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Sarah !

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Galgotias University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
