26/12/23, 12:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @263781285777 With this said, May I know if you are available for the discussion?
26/12/23, 12:32 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Yes please
26/12/23, 12:32 PM - +263 78 128 5777: It was scheduled for 2:00pm though
26/12/23, 12:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation dear, we can continue with the session now if you are comfortable otherwise we can continue at 2:00 PM.
26/12/23, 12:34 PM - +263 78 128 5777: No it's okay we can continue
26/12/23, 12:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @263781285777. As I was going through your conversation with Mr. Shivjeet, I am sure you have understood the benefits of Endowment Plan. Shall we continue from there?
26/12/23, 12:36 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Yes please
26/12/23, 12:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
26/12/23, 12:40 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Can you please provide information
26/12/23, 12:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure dear, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
26/12/23, 12:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
26/12/23, 12:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
26/12/23, 12:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
26/12/23, 12:43 PM - +263 78 128 5777: yes
26/12/23, 12:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
26/12/23, 12:45 PM - +263 78 128 5777: thats amazing
26/12/23, 12:46 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Yes it is quite impossible
26/12/23, 12:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
26/12/23, 12:51 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Yeah they are pretty tough calls to make
26/12/23, 12:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @263781285777. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
26/12/23, 12:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
26/12/23, 12:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
26/12/23, 12:53 PM - +263 78 128 5777: okay
26/12/23, 12:54 PM - +263 78 128 5777: yes ma'am
26/12/23, 12:55 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Therefore one needs 6 points and about to get a scholarship sit
26/12/23, 12:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
26/12/23, 12:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
26/12/23, 12:58 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Yes ma'am
26/12/23, 1:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
26/12/23, 1:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
26/12/23, 1:02 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Okay noted
26/12/23, 1:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/12/23, 1:04 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Can l please get clarity on the amounts and how they should be paid,,, The instalments and everything related to getting higher education
26/12/23, 1:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'll be more than happy to assist you dear, Before that I am sure that you must be aware that your total cost of education range is $2000 to $3000 and your registration cost is between $500 to $1000, right?
26/12/23, 1:07 PM - +263 78 128 5777: yes ma'am
26/12/23, 1:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation dear, Now as we proceed with your application you will soon receive the offer letter from the university. For the registration process, you need to pay the registration amount which is $1000 in order to reserve your scholarship seat. However, with the endowment benefit you have a grant of $100 which means you need to pay $900 for the registration fees. Along with this, For the registration amount we do have flexible payment plan which was shared with you earlier. May I know if you are aware of the same?
26/12/23, 1:14 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Yes l am aware
26/12/23, 1:15 PM - +263 78 128 5777: That we pay the first 450 within the deadline of the university and the remaining in a period of 30 to 45 days
26/12/23, 1:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct @263781285777. I am glad to see that you remember the payment plan. With this said, May I know if you have any other question?
26/12/23, 1:17 PM - +263 78 128 5777: However l would like to know if the universities gives us time to choose which one we want  before declaring a deadline
26/12/23, 1:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
26/12/23, 1:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
26/12/23, 1:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
26/12/23, 1:21 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Yes
26/12/23, 1:21 PM - +263 78 128 5777: yes ma'am
26/12/23, 1:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by University B, you would lose out on the scholarship from University B and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
26/12/23, 1:22 PM - +263 78 128 5777: There is Galgotias
26/12/23, 1:23 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Noh l am not
26/12/23, 1:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with the university A by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at  university A without risking losing out on the scholarship.
26/12/23, 1:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $1000 to University A to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University B where your registration fee is again $1000 .

If you wish to change your university to University B, in that case, one is to pay $1000 , but because you would have already paid $1000 for University A , the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $1000 at University B and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
26/12/23, 1:26 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Ohhh very well, Edoofa will guide me through out. How does one get to know of other universities ofgers
