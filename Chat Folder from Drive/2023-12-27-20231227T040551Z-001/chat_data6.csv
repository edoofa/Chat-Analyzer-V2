12 - 26 Dec 2023 12:55PM - Aditi Edoofa: Absolutely, and it's a great point to clarify. The Bible doesn't provide a specific date for the birth of Jesus. December 25th was chosen by later Christians to celebrate His birth, but it's not mentioned in the biblical accounts. The choice of December 25th was influenced by the Roman festival of Saturnalia and the winter solstice. Some scholars believe that Jesus was more likely born in the spring or fall.  So, when people celebrate Christmas on December 25th, it's more about commemorating the birth of Jesus and spreading the message of love, peace, and goodwill rather than pinpointing the exact historical date. Different cultures and Christian denominations may have varying traditions and interpretations related to the celebration.

Considering your hectic schedule, I've made some adjustments to our timetable.  *From now onwards, our sessions will take place from Monday to Friday, spanning from 1:30 pm to 3:30 pm*. Yes, we've extended the session to 2 hours for a more productive interaction.  So are you excited about the session?
5 - 26 Dec 2023 01:35PM - +263 77 466 4432: Ok mam . But why did we change from the morning session to the afternoon session
6 - 26 Dec 2023 01:35PM - +263 77 466 4432: I don't mind doing the afternoon session but why did we change <This message was edited>
7 - 26 Dec 2023 01:37PM - Jasmine Edoofa: My dear, initially, I could only allocate one hour in the morning. However, due to the considerable lag compared to other students, I sensed the necessity of prolonging the session to 2 hours. This adjustment aims to ensure that we cover more ground during our sessions.

By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
38 - 26 Dec 2023 02:33PM - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination). Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6. Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
39 - 26 Dec 2023 02:33PM - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
40 - 26 Dec 2023 02:33PM - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
41 - 26 Dec 2023 02:35PM - +265 996 40 67 62: Well noted
42 - 26 Dec 2023 03:57PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow. Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.

6 - 26 Dec 2023 01:36PM - Sharda Edoofa: *Good afternoon Precious* I hope you are doing well  As we embark on today's session, let me share a motivational thought: *'Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.' - Winston Churchill.* This quote reminds us that every step, be it a triumph or a stumble, is part of our journey.  Now, tell me, how did you celebrate Christmas? I believe celebrations are not just about the festive season but also moments of personal victories and joy. How are you doing, and is there anything you'd like to share about your experiences during the holiday season? Let's explore the path ahead together.
7 - 26 Dec 2023 02:01PM - +263 71 589 5789: There's nothing much....just family time ....how was yours??
8 - 26 Dec 2023 02:18PM - Sharda Edoofa: Okay Great. I too had a memorable family time.
9 - 26 Dec 2023 02:39PM - +263 71 589 5789: That is great
10 - 26 Dec 2023 02:40PM - Sharda Edoofa: Let us now continue our discussion exactly from where we left off.
11 - 26 Dec 2023 02:40PM - Sharda Edoofa: *When the school‚Äôs per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.*
12 - 26 Dec 2023 02:41PM - Sharda Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:  1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
13 - 26 Dec 2023 02:41PM - Sharda Edoofa: or 2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
14 - 26 Dec 2023 02:41PM - Sharda Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects. There is no deadline for the project. There is no order in which you have to do the project. There is no limit on how much you have to do a project. There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects. It's simple, the more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn. Moreover, it is important that you make steady progress every day.
15 - 26 Dec 2023 02:41PM - Sharda Edoofa: *Precious, that concludes our initial orientation. I trust that you've gained valuable insights and anticipate that there will be more to come as we progress towards achieving great success.* Our next point of contact will be on the EWYL Line during your scheduled sessions and will follow the Proud Edoofian ritual daily.
16 - 26 Dec 2023 02:43PM - +263 71 589 5789: Okay
17 - 26 Dec 2023 02:43PM - +263 71 589 5789: Okay
18 - 26 Dec 2023 03:00PM - Sharda Edoofa: *So now we are ready to begin our new journey. You are  supposed to note a few things*
19 - 26 Dec 2023 03:00PM - Sharda Edoofa: *FIRST* - Please know that the  batch for your sessions will be : *Tuesday and Friday*       *SECOND* - The timing for the session will be : *9:30 AM - 11:00 AM*
20 - 26 Dec 2023 03:00PM - Sharda Edoofa: *THIRD*- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line. Edoofa EWYL (contact):  +91 98107 89170     *FOURTH*- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say '*Greetings, Ms. Sharda, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'*
21 - 26 Dec 2023 03:00PM - Sharda Edoofa: *FIFTH* - Every day you  have to come and say ""I am a proud EDOOFIAN' on the EWYL line.
22 - 26 Dec 2023 03:00PM - Sharda Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. It fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *""I am a proud Edoofian*.",No,No

23 - 26 Dec 2023 02:58PM - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about- 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled 2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
24 - 26 Dec 2023 02:58PM - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you. Here is the message -   Hello Friends I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.* You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5‚ÄôS which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.

One of our partnered universities, Lovely Professional University (LPU), which is among the top 100 universities in India, has been considering your application for the scholarship opportunity. They have mentioned that they would be able to give us an update by the month of January, considering the high volume of applications they have received in the past two months (more than 2000 applications).
7 - 26 Dec 2023 06:56PM - Ashi Edoofa: In addition to this, the academic board also mentioned that there are a few more universities willing to put your application in consideration for scholarship opportunities in the month of January. Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter. This approach allows you to have multiple scholarship options, giving you the flexibility to decide on the university for your education in India and then carry out your visa application process the right way.
8 - 26 Dec 2023 06:56PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this update, I also want to inform you that since we are waiting for updates from the universities, we will be holding our conversation until 20th January and will reconnect around the same time. Until then, we wanted to share these updates with you so that you are well-informed about the process and know what lies ahead. We are thrilled to be a part of this new chapter in your academic journey.
9 - 26 Dec 2023 06:56PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, now that you are done with your admission process, you are encouraged to channel your energy and focus on your Earn While You Learn (EWYL) journey so that you can maximize the benefits from it. May this period be filled with meaningful learning, personal growth, and amazing opportunities.  If you are not connected with your EWYL Mentor or if you have any queries/concerns related to your admission journey, please feel free to reach out to us and we will do our best to assist you!

Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
7 - 26 Dec 2023 02:37PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India.

12 - 26 Dec 2023 03:02PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.  Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
13 - 26 Dec 2023 03:02PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.  As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
14 - 26 Dec 2023 03:07PM - +263 77 118 4986: That's good to hear hope the journey  will go as planned  and have a chance to live my dreams
15 - 26 Dec 2023 03:22PM - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @263771184986, With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
16 - 26 Dec 2023 03:22PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*  1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.  2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.  3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.  4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
26 - 26 Dec 2023 04:05PM - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27 - 26 Dec 2023 04:14PM - +263 77 118 4986: That's fair enough
28 - 26 Dec 2023 04:21PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3.*Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*  I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
29 - 26 Dec 2023 04:21PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
30 - 26 Dec 2023 04:23PM - +263 77 118 4986: Noted and well detailed
31 - 26 Dec 2023 04:39PM - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*  I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
32 - 26 Dec 2023 04:39PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
33 - 26 Dec 2023 04:39PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before December 30, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by January 30, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
34 - 26 Dec 2023 04:44PM - +263 77 118 4986: We can continue it's well detailed
35 - 26 Dec 2023 04:48PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?",No,No

Explain about Business process management  Business process management is the practice of modeling, analysing and optimising end to end business process to help meet your strategic business goals such as the improvement of your customer experience framework. In addition to that, business process management is the discipline in which people use various methods to discover, model, analyse, measure, improve, optimise and automate business processes. Any combination of methods used to manage a company's business process is business process management. Furthermore, business process management strategy involves defining, designing, executing, monitoring and optimising business process to increase efficiency, effectiveness and agility. Added to that, business process management helps the organisation to reduce wastage and achieve sustainable goals.

An increase in capital goods, labour force, technology, human capital can all contribute to economic growth. Economic growth is commonly measured in terms of the increase in aggregated market value of additional goods and services produced using estimates such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Furthermore, a business may contribute to economic development through organic growth. Organic growth refers to a situation whereby businesses expand internally rather than taking over or merging with other businesses. Organic growth can exist through a number of different ways such as increased output, expanding into international markets and launching new products. In addition to that, independent businesses provide their local economies with new jobs, products, revenue and services. Added to that, the introduction of new technologies may lead to efficiency in an organisation. Efficiency may influence the country's production possibility curve to shift outwards hence economic growth. On the other hand, the businesses may discover new raw materials and this may also lead to economic development
155 - 26 Dec 2023 08:38AM - +263 78 038 1173: 5. What is the importance of human resources in an organisation?  A key role of human resources is talent recruitment, training and retention. The human resources team can help an organisation to fill a crucial role with the right person. They can spend the time to craft the right incentive and benefits packages to make the company appealing and competitive. In addition to that, the human resources are most important services of any organisation since they are the catalyst of non-human resources and the medium for developing competitive advantages and sounds of creativity. No organisation can exist without a human resources department. Added to that, by leveraging the full potential of the human resources function, organisations can attract and retain top talent, build a positive workplace culture, manage and mitigate risk, drive business strategy and improve organisational performance. Lastly, human resources are an organisation's most important resource because they control all other company resources. That is the reason why it is so vital to have appropriate human resources in place at all time

155 - 26 Dec 2023 08:38AM - +263 78 038 1173: 5. What is the importance of human resources in an organisation?  A key role of human resources is talent recruitment, training and retention. The human resources team can help an organisation to fill a crucial role with the right person. They can spend the time to craft the right incentive and benefits packages to make the company appealing and competitive. In addition to that, the human resources are most important services of any organisation since they are the catalyst of non-human resources and the medium for developing competitive advantages and sounds of creativity. No organisation can exist without a human resources department. Added to that, by leveraging the full potential of the human resources function, organisations can attract and retain top talent, build a positive workplace culture, manage and mitigate risk, drive business strategy and improve organisational performance. Lastly, human resources are an organisation's most important resource because they control all other company resources. That is the reason why it is so vital to have appropriate human resources in place at all time

Rest assured, the exceptional service and support you have received will continue seamlessly as Ms. Ashi, one of our accomplished admission officers, takes over your admission journey from this point forward.

72 - 26 Dec 2023 04:37PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder‚Äôs office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa‚Äôs vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
73 - 26 Dec 2023 04:37PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you‚Äôve chosen that particular course and why you‚Äôre seeking admission in that particular school.

10 - 26 Dec 2023 02:51PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3.*Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*  I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
11 - 26 Dec 2023 02:51PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?

14 - 26 Dec 2023 03:11PM - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*  I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
15 - 26 Dec 2023 03:12PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
16 - 26 Dec 2023 03:12PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before December 30, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by January 30, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?

I would like to share an update with you: starting today, I will no longer be serving as your admission officer. I wanted to inform you that Ms. Ashi will be taking over from now on, and she will be reaching out to you very soon.  Over the past 12 months, I have had the privilege of serving as the admission officer for you and many other students. It has been a great experience getting to know the potential of my students and spending valuable time discussing their aspirations. However, every journey has its end, and now it's time for me to embark on a new chapter.  Rest assured, the exceptional service and support you have received will continue seamlessly as Ms. Ashi, one of our accomplished admission officers, takes over your admission journey from this point forward. I wish you the very best on your journey. Goodbye, my dear student.  Yours sincerely, Mr. Shivjeet Admission Officer

Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.

Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.

92 - 26 Dec 2023 04:19PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder‚Äôs office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa‚Äôs vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
93 - 26 Dec 2023 04:19PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you‚Äôve chosen that particular course and why you‚Äôre seeking admission in that particular school.

97 - 26 Dec 2023 04:38PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
98 - 26 Dec 2023 04:38PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa‚Äôs recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
99 - 26 Dec 2023 04:38PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?

20 - 26 Dec 2023 03:19PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*  The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
21 - 26 Dec 2023 03:19PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA‚Äôs Vision for You*  Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders.

22 - 26 Dec 2023 03:20PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*  In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
23 - 26 Dec 2023 03:20PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*  The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.",No,No

22 - 26 Dec 2023 07:12PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, thank you for asking, I am doing great. I am glad to know that we can connect now. I was able to go through your message above. I certainly understand your concern, however, January will be a long time, since the universities have to be fair with all the students. I can have a conversation with the university and help you process your admission as a regular application by 30th January, but that would mean letting go of the Endowment Grant of $150, and you will need to deposit $750. If you are okay with this, I can certainly take another step to help you out. However, I am here willing to help you so that you do not even lose on the endowment benefits, so let me know if you wish to know more about it?
23 - 26 Dec 2023 07:15PM - +263 78 056 8487: Yes we wish to know more about.

This scholarship serves as the initial stepping stone for her to access higher-quality education and pave the way for a successful career. <This message was edited>
26 - 26 Dec 2023 07:22PM - Kirti Edoofa: To assist you effectively, I would appreciate a more detailed understanding of your situation. This will enable us to align your needs with the university's policies and find a suitable solution. For me to understand your situation better here, I would like to understand how much have you raised so far and will be able to raise till the 28th of December?

121 - 26 Dec 2023 02:02PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Patience.  I hope you are doing well and had a delightful Christmas celebration. Thank you for sharing your concern with me here. Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
122 - 26 Dec 2023 02:02PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
123 - 26 Dec 2023 02:02PM - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
124 - 26 Dec 2023 02:03PM - +263 71 389 4785: I am fine and you. Okay
125 - 26 Dec 2023 02:03PM - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Lovely Professional University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application.  I hope you are clear about this now?",No,Yes

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.

45 - 26 Dec 2023 03:32PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.  It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
46 - 26 Dec 2023 03:32PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi‚Äôs FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.  If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?

Regarding the registration fee that you are required to pay, it can be adjusted to the university of your choice, and you have the privilege to do that as you are an Edoofian. It is one of the benefits that we provide to our students in terms of affordability and choices. May I know if you are clear here?

84 - 26 Dec 2023 08:50AM - +263 71 349 0117: Good morning Sir, I will definately be available today. Here sometime I face a lot of network challenges but I will try my level best.
85 - 26 Dec 2023 08:52AM - +263 71 349 0117: I will impart the knowledge I have learnt from a variety of sources, including details regarding international educational systems. My main goal is to help as much as I can and share information.  I will offer current details on international developments, policies, and practices in education. This can assist educators and policymakers in understanding effective strategies and customizing them to local contexts.  I will give suggestions based on current research and best practices. This will help in the revision of the educational curriculum. This will ensure that the curriculum meets students' evolving needs while still being in line with international standards.  I will participate in professional development and teacher training by offering lesson ideas and techniques. Teachers might become more proficient and knowledgeable by exchanging successful teaching techniques

Don‚Äôt you agree?

143 - 26 Dec 2023 12:01PM - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
144 - 26 Dec 2023 12:01PM - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*",No,Yes

96 - 26 Dec 2023 02:40PM - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
97 - 26 Dec 2023 02:40PM - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.

87 - 26 Dec 2023 12:45PM - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa‚Äôs vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India‚Äôs Independence.
181 - 26 Dec 2023 02:17PM - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
182 - 26 Dec 2023 02:18PM - +263 78 825 3372: Please do
183 - 26 Dec 2023 02:18PM - Gurvinder: Mitch basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation  If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.  *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).  *Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.  *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
184 - 26 Dec 2023 02:18PM - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
185 - 26 Dec 2023 02:20PM - +263 78 825 3372: Thank you for the information,  I feel it's straight forward.
186 - 26 Dec 2023 02:39PM - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.  Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
187 - 26 Dec 2023 02:40PM - +263 78 825 3372: No I am not
188 - 26 Dec 2023 02:40PM - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
189 - 26 Dec 2023 02:40PM - Gurvinder: Alright Mitch, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.  Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.

Sc Agriculture Intake Year: 2025 Country :Zimbabwe   SECTION 2 READING TEST  Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage. If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‚Äò gather resolution from despair‚Äô but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.  1. The title that best suits the passage would be: a) The Change of Nature b) The Will to Fight c) Courage and Panic d) The Miracle of Confronting Danger  2.A man may react to sudden danger in three different ways . What are they? a) He may be paralyzed with fear, run away or fight. b) He may flee in panic, or fight back or stand still. c) He may be paralyzed with fear, or seized with panic, or as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, and face the danger. d) He may be paralyzed with fear, seized with panic or act like an inferior animal.  3.What is the meaning of the word debilitating ? a) enfeeble b) thriving c) strengthen d) debase  4. Explain the phrase ‚Äògather resolution from danger‚Äô. a) Find peace in times of difficulty. b) To remain calm and not to lose hope. c) A state of utter hopelessness makes one determined to face the difficulty. d) To be enthusiastic and brave the odds.  5. The author feels happy in the recollection of dangers faced and overcome because a) He felt elated as he was alive. b) They added a new perspective and lifted him above himself for a time. c) They brought him a new experience. d) These experiences boosted his confidence.  SECTION 3 LANGUAGE TEST  Each passage below is accompanied by a number of questions. For some questions, you will consider how the passage might be revised to improve the expression of ideas.

The government has implemented policies aimed at reconciliation and promoting unity, and there has been a significant increase in economic development. However, the legacy of the genocide is still felt by many in the country, and challenges remain.  One of the most significant challenges is the prevalence of poverty. Although the economy has grown, more than half of the population still lives below the poverty line. In addition, the country has one of the highest rates of youth unemployment in the world.

So i started to like the idea of being able to look after myself and fix things when i needed to help people or using my head to solve difficult problem later on my aunt passed away( cancer ) and we could do nothing to help het at least we tried but am not good enough to be a doctor so i thought of a way in which i could help people in difficult times that why i choose engineering because it will give me the chance to make the world we are living in to be a better place
52 - 23 Dec 2023 01:34PM - +263 78 653 6532: So am into more about the environment( Globalisation) we live in in the aspect of how can we change the way we living. We all know that the world we living is slowly dettoriating mainly because of global warming which is leading to climate change etc so the problem is mainly the  use of fossil fuels and barning them would mean that mass production in the world would decrease and mainly African countries will suffer , so what if we were able to find solutions to all those problems. That is want i wanna be able to solve such problems through engineering and that's why i need to have this scholarship to be able to achieve something that will benefit us and the future generations

17 - 26 Dec 2023 10:41AM - +263 71 897 7886: OK what r the basic requirements for 1 to apply for the schoolaship
18 - 26 Dec 2023 11:28AM - Gurvinder: Okay so Mr Murimwa, as we start Shumirai's counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
19 - 26 Dec 2023 12:46PM - +263 71 897 7886: Yes ll be present throughout her counseling  and eligable process
20 - 26 Dec 2023 12:47PM - Gurvinder: That is great.

155 - 23 Dec 2023 12:43PM - Gurvinder: Taizibei, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing ‚Äì just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

158 - 26 Dec 2023 08:57AM - +260 96 5067812: Yes sir
159 - 26 Dec 2023 09:18AM - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.  *1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*  The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:  -_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0  -_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
160 - 26 Dec 2023 09:18AM - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*  Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:- -Nigenuis -Skooqs -Success Magazine -TIA Organics
161 - 26 Dec 2023 09:18AM - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*  We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: - _Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*. _How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi* _How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer!_ by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu* _It‚Äôs never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship_ by *Mr. Ronard Kachaje* _Decoding the science of personal branding_ by *Mr, Simon Maingi*

171 - 26 Dec 2023 09:18AM - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.  These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.  *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*

186 - 26 Dec 2023 10:07AM - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Taizibei, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
187 - 26 Dec 2023 10:09AM - +260 96 5067812: Oh okay
188 - 26 Dec 2023 10:27AM - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

216 - 26 Dec 2023 10:28AM - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.  I hope you can now realize how we are different isn‚Äôt it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
217 - 26 Dec 2023 10:40AM - +260 96 5067812: Well it really sounds like a very nice program.
218 - 26 Dec 2023 11:28AM - Gurvinder: Alright Taizibei, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.

222 - 26 Dec 2023 01:16PM - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well.

I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.

77 - 26 Dec 2023 11:37AM - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
78 - 26 Dec 2023 12:05PM - +263 71 436 8784: Studying abroad gives me a chance to interact with people of diverse cultures and this gives me a chance to explore  them and academically ,it is a great opportunity to pursue my studies abroad it makes me feel independent
79 - 26 Dec 2023 12:15PM - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.  In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
80 - 26 Dec 2023 12:53PM - +263 71 436 8784: Given the opportunity , l would advise the leaders of our education system on what to improve
81 - 26 Dec 2023 12:54PM - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Tinashe, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you.  Don‚Äôt you agree?
105 - 26 Dec 2023 01:50PM - +263 71 436 8784: üò≤ wow... India has great success, mostly in technological field
106 - 26 Dec 2023 01:55PM - Gurvinder: So now Tinashe, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
107 - 26 Dec 2023 02:05PM - +263 71 436 8784: Yes , what are the chances l get employed in India after l finish my course
108 - 26 Dec 2023 02:13PM - Gurvinder: Tinashe, in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!  You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
109 - 26 Dec 2023 02:22PM - +263 71 436 8784: I understand thank you
110 - 26 Dec 2023 02:41PM - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
111 - 26 Dec 2023 03:44PM - +263 71 436 8784: No Mr Gurvinder
112 - 26 Dec 2023 03:52PM - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
113 - 26 Dec 2023 03:52PM - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
114 - 26 Dec 2023 03:52PM - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
115 - 26 Dec 2023 03:52PM - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
116 - 26 Dec 2023 03:52PM - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:  *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*  *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
117 - 26 Dec 2023 04:26PM - +263 71 436 8784: This is affordable
118 - 26 Dec 2023 04:37PM - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
119 - 26 Dec 2023 08:07PM - +263 71 436 8784: Okay
120 - 26 Dec 2023 09:22PM - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it‚Äôs been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.  Have a good day ahead. God Bless You!",No,No

He is in the church choir( The Catholic Church). He even composes his own songs.  For Ordinary level he learnt at a C school Mkoba Number 3 High and he passed with flying colours . He had 10 As and a B out of 11 subjects.  For A level we decided to get him enrolled at an A school, Fletcher High School. He did Pure Mathematics , Physics and Chemistry and he passed. He had 2 Cs in Chemistry and Physics and an E in Pure Math

81 - 26 Dec 2023 06:54PM - +263 78 419 0078: I would like to clarify something about my family if you can allow me Mrs Harmehak
82 - 26 Dec 2023 07:08PM - +263 78 419 0078: I was initially married to Mr Innocent Kandoro and  we  had Tendai and Tinevimbo. Our relationship did not work out so we divorced.  I then remarried Mr Trust Dube and we had Thembelani and Tanyaradzwa . We live together. Mr Dube is a peasant miner, (he does gold panning) so our income is never certain. There are good times and some really tough times when we can have a long dry season. We were able to send him to a Secondary school with difficulties and he got a scholarship for advanced level that got him enrolled at Fletcher high school . He was under the Delta Bursary but as a day scholarship. We have been in a dry season for quit some time  and his biological father can't support him since he also has another family to take care of and he is empolyed as a security guard which means he earns enough to support his family. Well I just thought it was neccessarry that you know our actual family set up
83 - 26 Dec 2023 07:10PM - +263 78 419 0078: Tendai couldn't carry on under Delta Bursary because their condition was that he attains 15 points which means straight A passes for A levl
84 - 26 Dec 2023 07:15PM - +263 78 419 0078: Mr Dube 's highest level of education is grade 7. The problem was that we misinterpreted the first Form that we filled and thought we needed to enter biological father's details. His guardian father is Mr Dube and he has been supporting his son ever since with all he  has
85 - 26 Dec 2023 07:42PM - Harmehak: Sure please
86 - 26 Dec 2023 07:44PM - Harmehak: I appreciate your honesty please.

90 - 26 Dec 2023 08:14PM - Harmehak: So Mrs Cecilia, I would like to have a better understanding regarding the financial support for Tendai's higher education!  Can you please address the same?
91 - 26 Dec 2023 08:23PM - +263 78 419 0078: Honestly tertiary education is expensive for our income. Tendai has siblings who are also growing up , to mention his younger sister Tinevimbo just finished ordinary level . We have been serving but we are really behind time . Tendai wants to liberate himself financially and he was suggesting that if our first plan of serving does not work out he will look for a job and send himself to university while working so that we do not disadvantage his siblings. On the other hand we were also hoping for a scholarship opportunity but we were not really counting on this one since its not obvious, it is uncertain and with very low chances
92 - 26 Dec 2023 08:31PM - Harmehak: I do understand please.
93 - 26 Dec 2023 08:31PM - Harmehak: However, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.  *1. Scholarships* *2. Sponsorships*  Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.  Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.",No,No

108 - 26 Dec 2023 02:30PM - +263 77 385 0175: Good afternoon. Mrs. Mundangepfupfu will be assisting with the remaining fees.
109 - 26 Dec 2023 02:54PM - Kunal: That's completely understandable, So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.  So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
110 - 26 Dec 2023 03:06PM - +263 77 673 5858: They are open minded , excited,  delighted,  and hopeful that I achieve what I want to achieve by studying abroad.

112 - 26 Dec 2023 03:08PM - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be  1) Application Form  2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.  3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
113 - 26 Dec 2023 03:58PM - +263 77 673 5858: These are the only ones I'm familiar with
117 - 26 Dec 2023 04:08PM - +263 77 673 5858: Okay
118 - 26 Dec 2023 04:09PM - Kunal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation  If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.  Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).  Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.  The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
119 - 26 Dec 2023 04:09PM - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your  -Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team -Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities -Earn While You Learn Program and training -University sessions and interactions -A guaranteed scholarship seat -Visa Documentation Assistance The Foster and Care throughout your course
120 - 26 Dec 2023 04:09PM - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*

103 - 26 Dec 2023 11:25AM - Kunal: Shaun, while evaluating your application we are not just looking at your employability in India or Zimbabwe but Internationally, which means our universities are UGC affiliated and the degrees are valued internationally.

104 - 26 Dec 2023 11:25AM - Kunal: I also understand that you are referring to courses that are offered in Zimbabwean universities and based on their curriculum but you need to understand that the curriculum carries across nations and the syllabus that is covered it also different from that of Zimbabwe. For example, a Bachelor of Commerce in Economics might be offering you a specialization in Zimbabwe but when you look at India, Economics is already included in the course and there are courses like Bachelor of Business Administration will include Economics, Marketing, etc. which are well aligned with your career goals Therefore, you will have to understand that being your Career counselor I am looking at your employability not just in Zimbabwe or India but internationally which means you can work anywhere in the globe. Even when you look forward to working in Zimbabwe you will be considered and valued because your curriculum includes all these aspects that you require I am looking at opportunities that will be there after 3 years while you are looking at the opportunities that exist now

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year.

So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.  So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.

391 - 26 Dec 2023 11:32AM - Sahil Edoofa: So do you want me to guide you about the payment modes in depth ?
392 - 26 Dec 2023 02:24PM - Sahil Edoofa: Are we connected?
393 - 26 Dec 2023 05:28PM - +44 7518 635114: Yes we are,it's only that we were  occupied with Xmas celebrations
394 - 26 Dec 2023 06:22PM - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.  So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
395 - 26 Dec 2023 06:22PM - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-  BANK NAME: FBC  SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA  ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA  ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828  CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854

306 - 26 Dec 2023 11:53AM - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.  So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
307 - 26 Dec 2023 11:53AM - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-  BANK NAME: FBC  SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA  ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA  ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828  CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854

Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-  BANK NAME: FBC  SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA  ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA  ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828  CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854

So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

385 - 26 Dec 2023 12:21PM - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.  So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
386 - 26 Dec 2023 12:21PM - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-  BANK NAME: FBC  SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA  ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA  ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828  CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854

367 - 26 Dec 2023 07:43PM - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.  I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.",No,No

So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.  So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.",No,Yes

Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What‚Äôs more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.  4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
178 - 26 Dec 2023 11:13AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
179 - 26 Dec 2023 11:30AM - +263 71 686 4148: personally i appreciate the first point the most as this helps in students gaining higher education. Quite a great opportunity
180 - 26 Dec 2023 11:33AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand that your emphasis is on affordability. So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
181 - 26 Dec 2023 11:41AM - +263 71 686 4148: They feel really impressed and are proud they feel enthusiastic and are curious of what will happen in the future
182 - 26 Dec 2023 12:01PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
183 - 26 Dec 2023 12:01PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be  1) *Application Form*  2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.  3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
184 - 26 Dec 2023 12:07PM - +263 71 686 4148: yes Sir leaving them stress free
185 - 26 Dec 2023 12:17PM - +263 71 686 4148: An application form is required, when one i writing why they are applying for the scholarship  A Purpose statement in which an individual writes in detail why they are applying for the scholarship explaining theirselves(character wise),their qualifications, aspirations in life basically why they want the scholarship  A Recommendation, getting reference from higher ups of education such as the authorities from school recommending their qualities, behaviour and why they want to study abroad
186 - 26 Dec 2023 12:20PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Correct! Moving on, *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student‚Äôs application or they would straightaway reject it.  Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not* And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
194 - 26 Dec 2023 12:47PM - +263 71 686 4148: okay its understandable. So this counselling day will it be on the 30th of December?
195 - 26 Dec 2023 12:48PM - +263 71 686 4148: This is better it relieves both stress on the parents as well as the children its is very much appreciable and it establishes a friendly environment with the program
196 - 26 Dec 2023 12:49PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly reframe your question, please?
197 - 26 Dec 2023 12:50PM - +263 71 686 4148: The Phase 1 enrollment process is it on the 30 December or it is scheduled for another date
198 - 26 Dec 2023 12:51PM - +263 71 686 4148: Will there be any person to person interactions?
199 - 26 Dec 2023 01:11PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Babongile. Currently, we are engaged in a counseling session. Subsequently, following the conclusion of the session, the parents will partake in a video call with the Program Director, during which an interview will be conducted as part of the process!
200 - 26 Dec 2023 01:16PM - +263 71 686 4148: Wow! Its good to know that im in a session. Okay Sir i understand that there will be a session with the parents. It will be a good experience
201 - 26 Dec 2023 01:17PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Babongile! So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
202 - 26 Dec 2023 01:28PM - +263 71 686 4148: What i learnt about the financial aspects is that it may be of a challenge but it is made affordable due to the Earn While Learning Program which offers a stress free life for both parents and students. The program offers good scholarship credits and good mentorship which hone students in practical skills and helping them gain some good credits
203 - 26 Dec 2023 01:44PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.  *Enrollment fee* The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days  For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350  *Cost of education* The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2700-$3700 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc!  This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.

Therefore if a student has to study any *Healthcare course* in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any *Engineering Course* then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
62 - 26 Dec 2023 02:19PM - +263 78 335 0890: Oh I see So if someone had studied Maths Physics and Chemistry they would need to study biology as well?

It serves as the bridge between theoretical knowledge and real-world application, equipping students with the essential skills and experiences needed to thrive in their chosen fields.

59 - 26 Dec 2023 12:04PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Talent. *Edoofa* strongly recommends *India* for higher education! May I know what is your knowledge of India and the Indian Education System?
60 - 26 Dec 2023 12:24PM - +263 78 610 2677: India is a great country, rich in history, culture  and religion. I believe it has the best environment for tertiary education. The education culture in India has reached interesting times. Modern-day education is certainly aided by computers, projectors, the internet and many more. Everything that can be simplified has been made simpler. Technology and science have explored every aspect of life. Internet provides implausible knowledge, and there is no end to it.
61 - 26 Dec 2023 12:35PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Talent. India's education system stands as a testament to its rich cultural heritage and commitment to knowledge. Renowned globally for its ancient centers of learning like Nalanda and Takshashila, India has a strong foundation in education. The country's emphasis on a holistic approach, integrating traditional wisdom with modern learning, contributes to a well-rounded educational experience. India's cultural diversity is a unique strength, fostering an environment where students learn to appreciate and respect various perspectives, preparing them for a globalized world. Moreover, India's philosophy, deeply rooted in values like unity in diversity, non-violence, and spiritual exploration, resonates on a global level. The emphasis on harmony, balance, and interconnectedness reflects not only in educational curricula but also in the way people approach life. India's education system, cultural diversity, and philosophical principles collectively contribute to a global narrative of inclusivity, wisdom, and a holistic understanding of the world!
62 - 26 Dec 2023 12:35PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You will be glad to know that India's mechanical engineering prowess stands as a beacon on the global stage, illustrating a remarkable blend of innovation, precision, and technological acumen. Renowned for its diverse contributions, India has played a pivotal role in shaping the field of mechanical engineering. From the design and production of advanced machinery to groundbreaking research in robotics and automation, Indian engineers have consistently pushed the boundaries of what's possible. The nation's thriving automotive industry, with companies like Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra, reflects India's excellence in mechanical engineering. With a robust educational ecosystem and a focus on research and development, India continues to produce skilled mechanical engineers who contribute significantly to the world's technological landscape, making a lasting impact across various industries!
63 - 26 Dec 2023 12:35PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I will explain further why *Edoofa* recommends *India* as a destination for higher study.  1. *Robust Education System*: India boasts the world's third-largest education system, comprising 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges. This extensive infrastructure provides students with a diverse range of educational opportunities.  2. *Renowned Institutions*: India is home to highly rated institutions known for their academic excellence and quality of education. Students can choose from a wide range of disciplines, including politics, philosophy, engineering, medical sciences, biology, business, and media/journalism.  3. *Quality Education and Research*: Indian universities emphasize a rigorous academic curriculum that combines theoretical knowledge with practical skill development. Students have opportunities for cutting-edge research projects and collaboration with experts.
101 - 26 Dec 2023 02:05PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: - The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are: Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0 Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
102 - 26 Dec 2023 02:05PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: - Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:- Nigenuis Skooqs Success Magazine TIA Organics
103 - 26 Dec 2023 02:05PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: - We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: - Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade. How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu It‚Äôs never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
104 - 26 Dec 2023 02:05PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.  These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.  What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
105 - 26 Dec 2023 02:22PM - +263 78 610 2677: It will help me to gain working experience while learning and after finishing my degree it will be easier for me  to work in different environments using the experience which l would have gained on the EWYL
106 - 26 Dec 2023 02:43PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month
107 - 26 Dec 2023 02:43PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._  Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
108 - 26 Dec 2023 02:43PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.  Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
109 - 26 Dec 2023 02:43PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.  In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.  A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

288 - 26 Dec 2023 01:44PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I appreciate your thoughtful consideration regarding the timeline for the August 2025 intake. Opting for early enrollment brings forth several noteworthy advantages:  Exclusive Access to Scholarships: Edoofa scholarships are in high demand, and early enrollment ensures that your child has exclusive access to the financial support offered by our scholarship program.  Seat Assurance: Early enrollment guarantees your child a confirmed seat in the program, eliminating any potential competition for seats as the intake date approaches. This proactive approach ensures a smooth and stress-free admission process.  Ample Time for Preparation: The one and a half years leading up to the August 2025 intake provide a generous timeframe for meticulous preparation. This spans document verification, visa processing, and any academic preparations needed, contributing to a seamless transition.  Strategic Financial Planning: Enrolling early facilitates strategic financial planning. You gain the flexibility to explore various funding options, including the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) program, enabling you to establish a robust and stable financial plan for your child's education.  Fee Consistency Guarantee: Early enrollment secures the current fees, offering a consistent and predictable cost structure throughout the course. This shields against potential fee increases in the future.  Furthermore, admission for the August 2025 Intake opens up an opportune period for your child to make the most of this time:  Early Engagement in EWYL Program: A head start of over 20 months provides your child with a distinct advantage in the EWYL program. This time allows for a comprehensive understanding of projects and assignments, enabling the earning of scholarship credits even before arriving in India.(For example even if your child earns $100 a month he or she can self finance entire before even coming to India like many student often do let me share video of one such student )  Effective Communication with Admissions Team: Parents can proactively engage with the Admissions Team, focusing on financial planning and addressing any potential challenges. This proactive approach ensures a well-prepared international education journey for your child.  Community Integration: Becoming part of the Edoofa community early on allows students to connect with high achievers and toppers in their respective fields. This interaction proves invaluable for academic queries, potentially reducing the need for additional tuitions hence saving your cost for tutors.  Considering these factors, early enrollment not only secures the scholarship but also provides a substantial timeframe for thorough preparation and strategic planning.

This proactive approach ensures a smooth and stress-free admission process.  Ample Time for Preparation: The one and a half years leading up to the August 2025 intake provide a generous timeframe for meticulous preparation. This spans document verification, visa processing, and any academic preparations needed, contributing to a seamless transition.  Strategic Financial Planning: Enrolling early facilitates strategic financial planning. You gain the flexibility to explore various funding options, including the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) program, enabling you to establish a robust and stable financial plan for your child's education.  Fee Consistency Guarantee: Early enrollment secures the current fees, offering a consistent and predictable cost structure throughout the course. This shields against potential fee increases in the future.  Furthermore, admission for the August 2025 Intake opens up an opportune period for your child to make the most of this time:  Early Engagement in EWYL Program: A head start of over 20 months provides your child with a distinct advantage in the EWYL program. This time allows for a comprehensive understanding of projects and assignments, enabling the earning of scholarship credits even before arriving in India.(For example even if your child earns $100 a month he or she can self finance entire before even coming to India like many student often do let me share video of one such student )  Effective Communication with Admissions Team: Parents can proactively engage with the Admissions Team, focusing on financial planning and addressing any potential challenges. This proactive approach ensures a well-prepared international education journey for your child.  Community Integration: Becoming part of the Edoofa community early on allows students to connect with high achievers and toppers in their respective fields. This interaction proves invaluable for academic queries, potentially reducing the need for additional tuitions hence saving your cost for tutors.  Considering these factors, early enrollment not only secures the scholarship but also provides a substantial timeframe for thorough preparation and strategic planning.

183 - 26 Dec 2023 10:41AM - +263 77 782 0024: 2,3 and 4 are very clear to,clarity is needed with the first fact.My view of scholarship is like if one is on full cover scholarship, all that that person has to do is get it and do one's studies to completion
184 - 26 Dec 2023 10:44AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually you are mistaken over here, Let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.  *1. Scholarships* *2. Sponsorships*  Scholarships make education *affordable* for students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now A lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.  Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.

191 - 26 Dec 2023 12:13PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.

192 - 26 Dec 2023 12:13PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be  1) *Application Form*  2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.  3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
193 - 26 Dec 2023 12:14PM - +263 77 782 0024: Very correct sir!
202 - 26 Dec 2023 12:37PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
203 - 26 Dec 2023 12:49PM - +263 77 782 0024: It's like Edoofa is a self financing program only for those that are self-motivated to accomplish their education, if I may put it that way!
204 - 26 Dec 2023 12:50PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.  *Enrollment fee* The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days  For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350  *Cost of education* The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc!  This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.

132 - 26 Dec 2023 09:54PM - +260 96 9239401: So sorry for the late response. I belive studying in India can help me achieve my career goals because of the variety of opportunities that it has especially since civil engineering is an expanding industry. So how I can achieve this is by interacting and involving myself in practical training projects or even volunteering to work in a company. I would also acquire knowledge from civil engineers who have been in the field for a long period of time.

Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.

451 - 26 Dec 2023 12:33PM - Shubham Madhwal: Alright so, if you have gone through your Letter of Acceptance thoroughly, you must have seen, that there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-  1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account 2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe  May I know which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?

456 - 26 Dec 2023 01:12PM - Shubham Madhwal: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $80 to $100 which becomes quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $80 to $100 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr Shorwi's Account.
457 - 26 Dec 2023 01:12PM - Shubham Madhwal: So as you can see in the letter there is a Bank deposit in, Mr Shorwi Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School's account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe
458 - 26 Dec 2023 01:12PM - Shubham Madhwal: The fee payment can also be made through Hartzell High. School Ex-Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, *the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be 12.5% of the fees you are paying* the same details are as below:-  BANK NAME: FBC  BRANCH: Mutare  ACC NAME: Kawadza Shorwi  ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 0918 0214  CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 364 0738

424 - 26 Dec 2023 01:41PM - Shubham Madhwal: @263774608240 As you may recall from the counselling session, the counsellor informed you that the cost of education after the Edoofa Scholarship is approximately $2000-$3000. *However, with our special recommendation, as indicated, Prosper was considered for a higher quantum of scholarship. Therefore, the effective annual fee after the scholarship would be even lower, in the range of ($1600-$2300), as mentioned in the acceptance letter.*
425 - 26 Dec 2023 01:42PM - Shubham Madhwal: This consideration was made primarily during the evaluation process, as I recognized Prosper 's potential. I firmly believe that if students like him are provided with the right resources at the right time in their careers, they have the potential to become great future leaders. Hence, I made a special recommendation to the Edoofa Academic Board.

Nelson Mandela once said, ""Education is the most powerful weapon one can use to change the world."" and l am very sure that l do have  strength in using this weapon to make the world a better place.  Yes! I do have some weaknesses in several sports activities like rugby, soccer and so on, but in some of the extra curriculum activities, l am better for example chess, quiz and so on.  I would like to study medicine as l am passionated with medicine, since childhood. Currently my combination at A level is: 1. Pure Mathematics 2. Physics 3. Chemistry 4. Statistics  I am a male student from a well humbled family of six. Five siblings that are married and unemployed, and my beloved mother who is self-employed and sustain my educational needs after a series of hardworking.  My Father passed away when I was in form 2 and he was the breadwinner of the family. After his death my family members are now struggling to fulfill all my basic educational needs for example struggling to pay a maximum amount of $90 of school fees at my current school.  It is clear right now that all my family members will not be able to sustain me with all my tertiary educational needs in 2025. Those are some of the reasons why I am seeking help Ms Tushti, Mr Shubhan, Mr Jyotishman and all respected members  of EDOOFA.  I thank you.

111 - 26 Dec 2023 01:34PM - Tushti: Now, let me brief you about the EWYL Program
112 - 26 Dec 2023 01:34PM - Tushti: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing ‚Äì just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
113 - 26 Dec 2023 01:34PM - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_

My mother stays at home and my father works as a mechanic. The highest degree of education achieved by my parents is ordinary level.

24 - 26 Dec 2023 01:32PM - Tushti: Now, you mentioned you have younger siblings in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for the family to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are they facing such a situation?

A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth. Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles ‚Äì so much for rent, for food, for the children‚Äôs shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can‚Äôt really afford . As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.  1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage a)The cause of poverty is extravagance. b)Stingy habits of the poor. c)Being extravagant is always condemnable. d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.  2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time. b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle. c)Must be extravagant before achieving success. d)Should not bother about popularity.  3. The phrase ‚Äòlavish with his hospitality‚Äô in the third sentence of the first paragraph means a)Extravagance in entertaining guest. b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives. c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers. d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.  4.The word ‚Äòparadox‚Äô in the last sentence of the first paragraph means a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning b)Statement based on facts c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth. d)Statement based on the popular opinion  5.What is the meaning of the word ‚Äúequanimity‚Äù? a)Calmness b)Discomposure c)Equivocal d)Dubious  *_SECTION 3_*  *_Each passage below is accompanied by a number of questions. For some questions, you will consider how the passage might be revised to improve the expression of ideas. For other questions, you will consider how the passage might be edited to correct errors in sentence structure, usage, or punctuation. A passage or a question may be accompanied by one or more graphics (such as a table or graph) that you will consider as you make revising and editing decisions._* *_Some questions will direct you to an underlined portion of a passage. Other questions will direct you to a location in a passage or ask you to think about the passage as a whole._* *_After reading each passage, choose the answer to each question that most effectively improves the quality of writing in the passage or that makes the passage conform to the conventions of standard written English.

Choose that option if you think the best choice is to leave the relevant portion of the passage as it is._*  Whey to Go Greek yogurt‚Äîa strained form of cultured yogurt‚Äîhas grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.  6.supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. A) NO CHANGE B) supplement and convert it into gas to use as fuel in electricity production. C) supplement, while sweet whey is more desirable as a food additive for humans. D) supplement, which provides an important element of their diet.  7.can pollute waterways A) NO CHANGE B) can pollute waterway‚Äôs, C) could have polluted waterways, D) has polluted waterway‚Äôs,  8.scientists; and A) NO CHANGE B) scientists: and C) scientists, and D) scientists, and,  9.To make this paragraph most logical, Sentence 5 should be placed A) where it is now.

Also the other reason is that some other african countries are lowly financed so they just utilise few resources they have in their countries  which will result in poor diets in most of African countries They is also poor supply of knowledge to farmer in African countries that the government are not supporting farmers during their project which will lead to poor crops that will be supplied to consumers which will be of low quality. Moreover they is poor production of heavy machines which are used in agriculture and this is due to low financial problems in most countries in Africa <This message was edited>

87 - 26 Dec 2023 12:49PM - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:  *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*
88 - 26 Dec 2023 12:49PM - Tushti: In simple words Otilia, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

92 - 26 Dec 2023 01:47PM - Tushti: Now, let me brief you about teh EWYL Program
93 - 26 Dec 2023 01:48PM - Tushti: That is really great NAME I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,  However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.  Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?
94 - 26 Dec 2023 01:48PM - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
95 - 26 Dec 2023 01:48PM - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

123 - 26 Dec 2023 02:40PM - +263 77 481 2128: So let's say I have payed this $750 , am I going to be 100% sure that I have qualified in the Edoofa program
124 - 26 Dec 2023 02:41PM - Tushti: The amount is $350, please
125 - 26 Dec 2023 02:42PM - +263 77 481 2128: I am sorry for the misunderstanding
126 - 26 Dec 2023 05:30PM - Tushti: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
127 - 26 Dec 2023 05:30PM - Tushti: So, basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation  If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.  *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).  *Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.  *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
128 - 26 Dec 2023 05:30PM - Tushti: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
129 - 26 Dec 2023 05:30PM - Tushti: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
