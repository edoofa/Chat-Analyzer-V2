373 - 22 Dec 2023 03:51PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.  Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.  Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.  I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.  While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached  Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5‚ÄôS of Edoofa. Best of Luck!

Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready.

I'm thrilled to inform you that Tanatswa is one of the chosen students!  As part of this exciting role, we are inviting Tanatswa to share their personal journey in the group with Edoofa. From counseling sessions to EWYL experiences, we want to hear all about the positive changes Tanatswa has noticed within themselves. They can jot down their thoughts and share them with us, and I'll be happy to assist with proofreading.  Here's the exciting part: for every student from that group who enrolls in our program, Tanatswa will earn $5 per student! It's an incredible opportunity for Tanatswa to not only showcase their leadership skills but also earn rewards for their efforts.  We're looking forward to Tanatswa's active participation in the group and witnessing the positive impact they'll make as a student leader.

156 - 22 Dec 2023 08:52AM - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.* You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5‚ÄôS which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa. Best of Luck!
170 - 22 Dec 2023 09:10AM - Jasmine Edoofa: And #2  The *Scholarship Credits* earning opportunity for this project!  1. On every successful call/ email Response by the school to Team Edoofa- you will be awarded $2 2. Once the group or the process begins- you will be awarded $10 worth of scholarship credits 3. Surprise!! An Additional Opportunity to earn $25 worth of Scholarship Credits when 5 students complete their enrollment from one particular school!

264 - 22 Dec 2023 09:11AM - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.* You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5‚ÄôS which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa. Best of Luck!

Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6. Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
204 - 21 Dec 2023 10:17AM - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
205 - 21 Dec 2023 10:17AM - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120

98 - 22 Dec 2023 02:23PM - +263 71 401 4355: So according to my understanding, a few factors are considered to make sure that one looks for the right type of company. These factor include a) The nature of the company which must be either student-centric, recreational or content-centric platform. Examples listed include Obami, Aficazilla, Palmpay, only to mention a few b) Scale of the company which should neither be too be nor too small c) Financial stability. The company must be financially stable and sound d) Background of founder. The founder must have a strong background in terms of qualifications and experience. I've  also understood that platforms like Linkedln and google can be used to connect to these companies as well as social media platforms like facebook and instagram. A few steps have been outlined in the process to look for the right companies. These include 1) Searching which is by connecting with founders and start-ups on linkedln and on google 2) studying the nature of the company, its functions, purposes and expertise 3) Studying the website of the company to check if it is working properly 4) Checking the various social media platforms of the company to get an idea of the activities and functioning status of the company 5) To understand the background of the founder and other core members 6) Reaching out the company members and dropping connections requests. That is all I understood. Thank you

516 - 22 Dec 2023 08:42AM - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning dear parent @263773252317  I am reaching out to you with regard to *Precious's* unavailability in our EWYL sessions. It has been a tendency from *Precious‚Äôs* end to be unresponsive to the reminders and updates sent every now and then.  I would like to tell you that my other students who are in Africa right now are active and highly involved in our discussions and a few of them have been able to earn more than $500 - $600 in scholarship credits. All they did was they responded to the project work update and worked according to my advice.  Now that *Precious* is in Africa, it is the perfect scope to utilize this time wisely in order to secure a future here in India. There will be upskilling which will lead to personal growth as well as there will be an opportunity to earn financial independence too which inturn will lead to letting go of any burden on you as a parent.  I would now like to understand your thoughts regarding this and I am also keen to understand the challenges that *Precious* is facing. I am looking forward to an improved participation.
517 - 22 Dec 2023 10:02AM - +263 77 325 2317: Morning . I don't think it's fair to say Precious is not responsive, l made it clear from day one that the area experience network problems. Whenever network is there l have followed quite closely responding to conversations. For your own information this week network was terrible and thus beyond our control, it goes on and off. It's do on line reports at my work but these past 2 week have been difficult, so you see it's not anybody's fault . I might get the messages when moving around  probably because l passed through a place with better network the truth is l don't operate from home. Infact she always asks if there are any messages siting poor network.

236 - 22 Dec 2023 11:03AM - Sharda Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:  1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them or 2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

219 - 22 Dec 2023 02:08PM - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about- 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled 2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
220 - 22 Dec 2023 02:08PM - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you. Here is the message -         Hello Friends I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.* You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5‚ÄôS which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa. Best of Luck!
221 - 22 Dec 2023 02:08PM - Sharda Edoofa: Are you following the discussion.

Prosecutors work to convict people of crimes, while defense attorneys work to defend their clients against the charges brought by the prosecutor. It's important to have both types of attorneys, so that everyone has a fair trial and the legal system works the way it's supposed to.

249 - 22 Dec 2023 09:11AM - +263 71 870 6208: Let's dig a little deeper into some of these skills. For example, communication is so important because lawyers need to be able to talk to clients, judges, and other lawyers. They also need to be able to write clear and concise legal documents. And they need to be able to speak clearly and confidently in court.

Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*  On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
257 - 22 Dec 2023 08:33PM - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.  This means Unathi, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
258 - 22 Dec 2023 08:35PM - +27 63 826 9733: Okay ma'am
259 - 22 Dec 2023 08:58PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*  I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
260 - 22 Dec 2023 08:58PM - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
261 - 22 Dec 2023 08:58PM - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
262 - 22 Dec 2023 08:59PM - +27 63 826 9733: Yes ma'am
263 - 22 Dec 2023 08:59PM - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*  I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.",No,Yes

171 - 22 Dec 2023 07:07PM - +263 77 168 2406: Okay
172 - 22 Dec 2023 07:16PM - +263 71 480 1825: Okay
173 - 22 Dec 2023 07:31PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
174 - 22 Dec 2023 07:32PM - +263 77 168 2406: Okay why
175 - 22 Dec 2023 08:03PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500.

177 - 22 Dec 2023 08:13PM - +263 71 480 1825: So the money is deposited into Edoofa?
178 - 22 Dec 2023 08:24PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct. If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child‚Äôs Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
179 - 22 Dec 2023 08:24PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fee.
181 - 22 Dec 2023 08:24PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
182 - 22 Dec 2023 08:27PM - +263 77 168 2406: Will have to discuss it as a family first then get back to you
183 - 22 Dec 2023 08:32PM - +263 71 480 1825: Okay , so is this optional or compulsory
184 - 22 Dec 2023 08:36PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: These plan is compulsory for every student for the year of intake 2025
185 - 22 Dec 2023 08:37PM - +263 71 480 1825: Okay, so when will these investments start?

140 - 22 Dec 2023 10:16AM - +263 71 249 4868: 2. Explain about BPM ( Business Process Management ) Life Cycle. Business Process Management is an approach focused on aligning all aspects of an organization with the wants and needs of a client.  It consists of five stages which are designing, modeling, executing, monitoring and optimizing. I'm going to describe the stages fully below.  Designing encompasses  the identification of existing processes and the design of to-be processes. Good design reduces the number of problems. The aim of this step is to ensure that a correct efficient theoretical design is prepared.  Furthermore, modeling takes the theoretical design and introduces combinations of variables.  The execution stage is one of the ways to automate processes thereby  purchasing an application that executes the required steps of the process. To eliminate problems at the execution stage software to be developed should enables the full business process to be defined in a computer language.  Moreover, the monitoring phase is where  performance is measured. Monitoring encompasses the tracking of individual processes and statistics on the performance of one or more process can be provided.  On the optimization stage, the retrieving process, identifying the potential opportunities for cost savings and applying those enhancements in the design of the process is done.  Conclusively, the five stages creates greater business value.
141 - 22 Dec 2023 10:16AM - +263 71 249 4868: 3. How does business contribute to economic development?  The business helps to stabilize, stimulates and contributed to the growth of economics  by investing in people's demands, creation of employment, new technology, solution to new challenges and active competition. This essay seeks to fully describe on how business contribute to economic development.  To begin with, business allows people to have access to the commodities and services they need to be productive.  Business requires more people for the production activities for example Coca-Cola, hence more people are employed.  Business brings in new technology as machinery or labor incentives methods from a foreign nation brings technological development.  Thus the advanced productivity increases the income of a region and are directly impacted when new businesses exports goods and services to neighboring countries.  However, due to stiff competition in businesses this may lead to lowering of prices thereby reducing economic development.  Industries may lead to pollution thereby leading to the destotion of the land.  Conclusively business contribute to the economic development positively as the impacts outweigh the non impacts.
142 - 22 Dec 2023 10:16AM - +263 71 249 4868: 5. Explain the importance of HR in an organisation.  This essay will discusses why Human Resource  is the most important asset of an organization.  Human Resource  will be an essential need and require for an organization to establish further with a good employees recuited towards the success of an organization.  The role of Human Resource Management  is also to set the right policies to produce an organization performance.

150 - 22 Dec 2023 08:50PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
151 - 22 Dec 2023 08:51PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
152 - 22 Dec 2023 08:51PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?

203 - 22 Dec 2023 07:32PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child‚Äôs Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
204 - 22 Dec 2023 07:32PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fee.
205 - 22 Dec 2023 07:32PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee.  From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
206 - 22 Dec 2023 07:35PM - +263 77 140 5373: Okay I understand
207 - 22 Dec 2023 08:02PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
208 - 22 Dec 2023 08:18PM - +263 77 140 5373: Well I think it does ease the burden and pressure
209 - 22 Dec 2023 08:18PM - +263 77 140 5373: It is also good and helps save up some money in a much secure way as well

With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months.

50 - 22 Dec 2023 04:12PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
51 - 22 Dec 2023 04:53PM - +263 77 396 3440: I have read the benefits Sir
52 - 22 Dec 2023 05:53PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
53 - 22 Dec 2023 05:53PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*  On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
54 - 22 Dec 2023 05:53PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.  This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
55 - 22 Dec 2023 05:55PM - +263 77 396 3440: Okay Noted with thanks
56 - 22 Dec 2023 06:12PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*  I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.

57 - 22 Dec 2023 06:12PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
58 - 22 Dec 2023 06:12PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
59 - 22 Dec 2023 06:13PM - +263 77 396 3440: Yes Sir
60 - 22 Dec 2023 06:14PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*  I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $650.
62 - 22 Dec 2023 06:18PM - +263 77 396 3440: May l ask something Sir with my previous mentor said l had been offered a fully funded scholarship so is it not valid anymore
63 - 22 Dec 2023 06:25PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you might be able to share me with the screenhot of the message.
64 - 22 Dec 2023 06:29PM - +263 77 396 3440: Well l use a different phone now but it was last year during the women Under 19 cricket world cup which l was taking part in that's when l was chatting with him l even refered him to my manager
65 - 22 Dec 2023 06:35PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: As you know that Your scholarship works on a merit based you will try to see to it in your offer letter for now.
66 - 22 Dec 2023 06:36PM - +263 77 396 3440: Okay
67 - 22 Dec 2023 06:59PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: So in the meantime shall we proceed with the session?
68 - 22 Dec 2023 07:00PM - +263 77 396 3440: Yes
69 - 22 Dec 2023 07:01PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*  I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
70 - 22 Dec 2023 07:01PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
71 - 22 Dec 2023 07:01PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $650, you'll need to make a payment of $325 on or before December 30, 2023. The remaining $325 should be paid by January 30, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
80 - 22 Dec 2023 07:50PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?  *1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)* *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)* *3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
81 - 22 Dec 2023 07:52PM - +263 77 396 3440: Noted
82 - 22 Dec 2023 07:56PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -  *1. Reappear in A Level*  Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
83 - 22 Dec 2023 07:56PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
84 - 22 Dec 2023 07:59PM - +263 77 396 3440: Yes l am but l would like to persue  cricket also so will that be possible to get a into a University which has sports
85 - 22 Dec 2023 08:16PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*  Yes, indeed that is completely possible. Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.

87 - 22 Dec 2023 08:18PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
88 - 22 Dec 2023 08:19PM - +263 77 396 3440: Yes it's clear
89 - 22 Dec 2023 08:28PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,  *3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*  Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program.

191 - 22 Dec 2023 07:03PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay by tomorrow before your due date of December 30, 2023.
192 - 22 Dec 2023 07:04PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months.  That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
193 - 22 Dec 2023 07:04PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?",No,Yes

Rights are often legally protected, while duties may not be. Human rights are the basic rights and freedoms that all humans are entitled to, regardless of their nationality, race, gender, or other factors. Civil rights are the specific rights and freedoms that are guaranteed by the laws of a country, such as the right to vote, the right to due process, and the right to equal protection under the law.  Furthermore,Rights are the freedoms that a person has, while duties are the obligations that a person has. Rights are about what a person can do, while duties are about what a person must do. Rights are often seen as ""positive"" entitlements, while duties are seen as ""negative"" obligations. Rights are often seen as legally enforceable, while duties may be seen as more moral or ethical obligations. For example, the right to free speech is a legal right that is protected by law.   To elaborate further, human rights are based on the idea that all people are entitled to certain basic freedoms, such as the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. These rights are often enshrined in national constitutions and international treaties, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Civil rights, on the other hand, are those that are specific to a particular country or region, and may not be as widely recognized. For example, the right to vote is a civil right in many countries, but it is not a human right that is recognized by all nations.  However, Rights are freedoms that a person has, while duties are obligations that a person has. The two are often intertwined, with rights giving people the freedom to do what they want, and duties giving people the responsibility to use that freedom in a way that benefits everyone. The concept of rights and duties can vary depending on the context, but they are always about balancing the needs and interests of individuals and the wider society.  To put it simply, rights and duties are two sides of the same coin. Without rights, people would not have the freedom to pursue their own interests. Without duties, there would be no social order or protection for the weak and vulnerable. They go hand in hand, and both are necessary for a just and functioning society. It's important to remember that the exact nature of rights and duties may vary depending on the society and context, but the underlying principle remains the same.  To conclude,There are many difference between rights and duties. One cannot turn a blind eye on some similarities of rights and duties.     3 *.What is the difference between a prosecutor and an attorney*  There are several differences between a prosecutor and an attorney. A prosecutor is a lawyer who works for the government, and their job is to bring criminal charges against people accused of crimes. An attorney, on the other hand, is a lawyer who can represent people in any legal matter, including both criminal and civil cases. In addition, prosecutors only represent the state, while attorneys can represent individuals, businesses, or organizations. Prosecutors also have the power to decide whether to bring charges against someone, while attorneys do not have that power.  In addition, There are several other differences between prosecutors and attorneys. Prosecutors are often salaried government employees, while attorneys can be private practitioners or work for firms. Prosecutors typically have a lot of experience with the criminal justice system, while attorneys may specialize in other areas of the law. Finally, prosecutors are usually bound by ethical rules and laws that prevent them from disclosing certain information about their cases, while attorneys are not always subject to the same restrictions.  Furthermore, some of different roles of prosecutors and attorneys, we can explore that as well. As mentioned before, prosecutors work for the government and bring criminal charges against people. They also work with law enforcement to investigate crimes, and they make decisions about whether to offer a plea deal or go to trial. Attorneys, on the other hand, can represent either the prosecution or the defense in a case. They interview witnesses, prepare evidence, and make arguments on behalf of their clients. In this way, prosecutors and attorneys have complementary but different roles in the criminal justice system.  Moreso, There are different types of attorneys. First, there are civil attorneys, who handle disputes between individuals or businesses. Then, there are criminal defense attorneys, who represent people who have been accused of a crime. There are also family law attorneys, who specialize in matters like divorce, child custody, and adoption. And there are also personal injury attorneys, who handle cases involving injuries that people have suffered. There are many more types of attorneys, but these are some of the most common.  Appart from the above , there are also some similarities between prosecutors and attorneys. For example, both types of lawyers are required to have a law degree, and both must pass a bar exam. Both types of lawyers must also adhere to ethical standards of conduct, such as confidentiality and honesty. Additionally, both prosecutors and attorneys must have strong research, writing, and communication skills. And finally, both types of lawyers must be prepared to argue their cases in court if necessary.  In conclusion, both prosecutors and attorneys play crucial roles in our legal system. Prosecutors enforce the law and hold people accountable for breaking it, while attorneys represent and advocate for their clients. While there are some similarities between the two professions, there are also many important differences. These differences reflect the different roles that prosecutors and attorneys play in our society. It's important to understand these differences in order to appreciate the complexity of our legal system.     *4.Which branch of law are you most interested in pursuing, Civil, Corporate or Criminal,* and why?   Reasons to prefer criminal law is that it can be seen as a more ""pure"" form of law, since it's focused on protecting the public interest. Criminal law also has a clear and well-defined structure, with clear rules and procedures. Criminal law also offers the chance to see justice served and wrongs made right. Finally, it's a challenging and engaging area of law, with plenty of opportunities for growth and development.  Criminal law has a clear and well-defined structure. There are established rules and procedures that must be followed in every case. For example, there are strict rules about what evidence can be used, and how it must be presented. There are also clear guidelines for how the prosecution and defense must behave, and what they are allowed to do. This structure ensures that everyone is treated fairly and has the same rights and protections. It also makes the process more transparent and understandable for everyone involved.  Seeing justice served is one of the most satisfying parts of working in criminal law. When someone has broken the law and caused harm, it can be very gratifying to see them held accountable and punished for their actions. This is especially true when the victim is able to see justice served, and they can feel some sense of closure and healing. Even if the criminal justice system isn't perfect, it can still be very meaningful to see it working to make things right.  Moreso,When we talk about ""wrong made right"" in criminal law, we're referring to the idea of ""restorative justice"". This is a concept that focuses on repairing the harm that has been done, rather than just punishing the offender. For example, a victim of a crime may be able to receive compensation for their losses, or the offender may be required to do community service or other forms of restitution. In this way, the wrong can be made right in a way that goes beyond simply locking someone .  Criminal law is designed to treat everyone fairly and equally, regardless of their background or status. This is known as the principle of ""equality before the law"". Under this principle, everyone is entitled to the same rights and protections, and they should be treated in the same way by the criminal justice system. This means that rich and poor, famous and unknown, powerful and powerless, should all be treated equally. For example, everyone has the right to a fair trial, the right to an attorney, and the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.  In conclusion, criminal law is an important part of the legal system, and it has many benefits. It provides a way to hold people accountable for breaking the law, it can make victims feel better by seeing justice served, and it treats everyone fairly and equally. Criminal law is an ever-evolving field, and it will continue to play a crucial role in society.     *5.What skills do you believe you have that will make you a successful lawyer, please elaborate with an example* .

Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -  *Step 1: Message from the founder‚Äôs office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa‚Äôs vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
97 - 22 Dec 2023 08:03PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you‚Äôve chosen that particular course and why you‚Äôre seeking admission in that particular school.  I hope these two steps are clear.
98 - 22 Dec 2023 08:08PM - +263 78 327 6052: Yes they are clear but may you give some more information on the 2nd step
99 - 22 Dec 2023 08:24PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, it will be provided in details as we proceed with the session.

92 - 22 Dec 2023 02:42PM - +263 77 328 7663: Yes
93 - 22 Dec 2023 03:02PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: As person our recent conversation it has been noted that you were not interested in the program. Hence I would like to come to that again that if you are finally on track and wanted to persue your higher education?
94 - 22 Dec 2023 03:04PM - +263 77 328 7663: Lets not change the program l will continue with computer science
95 - 22 Dec 2023 03:09PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.
96 - 22 Dec 2023 03:09PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Along with that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:  *1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry A-Level (If you do not have the A level Results).*  *2. O-Level Results*  *3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)* <This message was edited>
97 - 22 Dec 2023 03:18PM - +263 77 328 7663: <Media omitted>
135 - 22 Dec 2023 04:45PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
136 - 22 Dec 2023 04:45PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
137 - 22 Dec 2023 04:45PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
138 - 22 Dec 2023 04:45PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
139 - 22 Dec 2023 04:51PM - +263 77 328 7663: Ok sir
140 - 22 Dec 2023 05:53PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?  *1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)* *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)* *3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
141 - 22 Dec 2023 06:08PM - +263 77 328 7663: I agree with benefit number 6
142 - 22 Dec 2023 06:12PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -  *1. Reappear in A Level*  Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
143 - 22 Dec 2023 06:12PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?

188 - 22 Dec 2023 06:45PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
189 - 22 Dec 2023 06:45PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
190 - 22 Dec 2023 06:45PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
191 - 22 Dec 2023 06:45PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
192 - 22 Dec 2023 06:46PM - +263 71 338 7901: Thats  right

Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
194 - 22 Dec 2023 07:02PM - +263 71 338 7901: Yes sir you can explain
195 - 22 Dec 2023 07:18PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500.
196 - 22 Dec 2023 07:27PM - +263 71 338 7901: Oky
197 - 22 Dec 2023 07:57PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
198 - 22 Dec 2023 08:00PM - +263 71 338 7901: Yes y 10 months
199 - 22 Dec 2023 08:03PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child‚Äôs Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.

200 - 22 Dec 2023 08:03PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fee.
201 - 22 Dec 2023 08:03PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee.  From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
199 - 22 Dec 2023 08:03PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child‚Äôs Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
200 - 22 Dec 2023 08:03PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fee.

202 - 22 Dec 2023 08:03PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
203 - 22 Dec 2023 08:13PM - +263 71 338 7901: So the paymenet of this momey makes ot ceryain that  a seat w be reserved since  the Edoofa team will be sure that we have the potential to raise the money
204 - 22 Dec 2023 08:38PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct, your seat at the university is guaranteed and if not the fulll amount will be refunded to you.
205 - 22 Dec 2023 08:39PM - +263 71 338 7901: Okay
206 - 22 Dec 2023 08:40PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
207 - 22 Dec 2023 08:41PM - +263 71 338 7901: Is there an option that we can save for ten months for ourselves ?

According to my research UI stands for User Interface, which refers to the visual elements and design of a digital product or application. It includes components such as buttons, menus, icons, and overall layout. UX stands for User Experience, which focuses on the overall experience and satisfaction of users when interacting with a product.  In today's digital world, UI/UX plays a crucial role in creating successful and user-friendly digital experiences. A well-designed UI enhances the aesthetics and usability of a product, making it visually appealing and intuitive for users to navigate. UX ensures that the product is designed with the user's needs, goals, and preferences in mind, resulting in a seamless and satisfying user experience.
118 - 22 Dec 2023 03:29PM - +263 78 126 2807: 3.What is your understanding of the OSI model? Please explain it with the layers involved.  As i have learnt and researched ,the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that defines how different network protocols communicate and interact with each other. It consists of seven layers, each responsible for specific functions and tasks. Here is a brief explanation of my understanding:  1. Physical Layer: This layer deals with the physical transmission of data over the network. It defines the physical characteristics of the network, such as cables, connectors, and electrical signals.  2. Data Link Layer: The data link layer provides error-free transmission of data frames between nodes on the same network segment. It handles tasks such as framing, error detection, and flow control.  3. Network Layer: The network layer is responsible for addressing, routing, and forwarding data packets across different networks. It determines the best path for data transmission and deals with logical addressing.  4. Transport Layer: The transport layer ensures reliable and efficient data transfer between end systems. It segments data from the session layer into smaller units, manages data flow, and provides error recovery and retransmission.  5. Session Layer: The session layer establishes, manages, and terminates communication sessions between applications. It handles session synchronization, checkpointing, and recovery in case of failures.  6. Presentation Layer: The presentation layer is responsible for data formatting, encryption, compression, and conversion. It ensures that data from the application layer is properly formatted and understood by the receiving system.  7. Application Layer: The application layer is the layer closest to the end-user and provides network services directly to applications. It includes protocols for functions such as email, file transfer, remote access, and web browsing.  In conclusion the OSI model provides a standardized framework for understanding and developing network protocols. Each layer performs specific tasks and interacts with adjacent layers to enable seamless communication and data exchange across networks.

Programming refers to the process of writing and creating computer programs or software. It involves designing, coding, testing, and maintaining instructions that tell a computer how to perform specific tasks or solve problems.  Programming languages are formal languages with a set of syntax and rules used to write computer programs. They provide a way for programmers to communicate with computers and give instructions in a format that the computer can understand and execute.  There are numerous programming languages available, each with its own strengths, weaknesses, and areas of application. Some of the most widely used programming languages in today's applications include:  1. JavaScript: JavaScript is a versatile scripting language primarily used for web development. It allows for interactive and dynamic elements on websites and is supported by all major web browsers.  2. Python: Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used in various domains, including web development, data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing.  3. Java: Java is a popular programming language known for its platform independence. It is used for building enterprise-level applications, Android app development, and large-scale systems.  4. C#: C# (pronounced C sharp) is a programming language developed by Microsoft. It is widely used for Windows application development, game7 development, and enterprise software development on the .NET framework.  5. Swift: Swift is a programming language developed by Apple for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS app development. It is designed to be safe, efficient, and easy to learn.  The popularity of programming languages can vary depending on factors such as community support, performance, ease of use, availability of libraries and frameworks, and industry trends. The languages mentioned above have gained popularity due to their versatility, robustness, and extensive developer communities, making them suitable for a wide range of applications and platforms. <This message was edited>
120 - 22 Dec 2023 03:41PM - +263 78 126 2807: 5. What is the difference between compilers and interprete?  According to what i have researched and understood, Compilers and interpreters are both tools used in the execution of programming languages, but they differ in how they process and execute code:  1. Compiler: A compiler is a software tool that translates the entire source code of a program into machine code or a lower-level language known as object code. It performs a static analysis of the source code, checks for errors, and generates an executable file or binary that can be directly executed by the computer's hardware. The compiled code is typically optimized for performance. Examples of compiled languages include C, C++, and Java.  2. Interpreter: An interpreter, on the other hand, directly executes the source code line by line without prior translation into machine code or object code. It reads each statement, interprets it, and executes it immediately. Interpreters typically perform dynamic analysis of the code, executing it in a step-by-step manner. Examples of interpreted languages include Python, JavaScript, and Ruby.  The differences between compilers and interpreters include:  Execution: A compiler translates the entire source code before execution, producing an executable file. An interpreter executes the code directly, line by line, without generating an executable file.  Performance: Compiled code tends to have better performance as it is optimized during the compilation process. Interpreted code may have slower execution as it is interpreted line by line.  Error detection: Compilers perform a thorough analysis of the source code, detecting errors before generating the executable file. Interpreters detect errors during runtime when executing the code line by line.  Portability: Interpreted languages are generally more portable as the interpreter can be installed on different platforms. Compiled languages often require recompilation for different platforms.  Development process: Compiling can be a separate step in the development process, requiring explicit compilation before execution. Interpreted languages allow for more rapid development and debugging as changes can be immediately tested without the need for compilation.  Both compilers and interpreters have their advantages and are suitable for different scenarios depending on factors such as performance requirements, development speed, and platform compatibility. <This message was edited>

137 - 22 Dec 2023 07:22PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:  *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.  *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.  *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.  *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
138 - 22 Dec 2023 07:23PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.  *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.  *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.  *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
139 - 22 Dec 2023 07:23PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon.  It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?

224 - 22 Dec 2023 11:21AM - +265 999 42 75 54: Good morning Mr Austin.. sorry over the night l was asking myself on another lmportant question about the visa fee and air ticket.. is this funded or it's suppose to be catered by us parents or guardians?
225 - 22 Dec 2023 12:02PM - Austin: Good Day to you! How are you doing?
226 - 22 Dec 2023 12:02PM - Austin: If you understand the concept of International Education, the finances that play a major role is not visa fee or flight ticket because visa fee is given once in the whole program and the flight ticket is taken a limited number of times,maybe twice or once,because international students don't often travel back to their country.  They look forward to settling down and making sure education is not hampered.So they learn and do internships at breaks.But still students can definitely visit their family during holidays and spend time with them.  But I personally have seen that students don't travel often,so considering these the traveling fee (air fare :-around $450,Visa fee:-$83) *is to be borne by the student* which is mostly a one time investment.
227 - 22 Dec 2023 12:10PM - +265 999 42 75 54: Iam good.. oky l have taken note of this and l think it has to be part of our preparation in case our daughter is selected..

111 - 22 Dec 2023 10:52AM - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
121 - 22 Dec 2023 11:04AM - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.  These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
122 - 22 Dec 2023 11:04AM - Garima Edoofa: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?

157 - 22 Dec 2023 01:17PM - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling : 1.*Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*‚Äã: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.  2.*Employability through practical training*‚Äã: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.   3.*Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What‚Äôs more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.   4.*Higher Education Concierge*‚Äã: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.",No,Yes

191 - 22 Dec 2023 10:24AM - Garima Edoofa: Original as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn‚Äôt given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*

18 - 22 Dec 2023 10:24AM - +263 78 687 8577: Okay....My name is Robin Wilkinson Chamboko a young man aged 21 born on the 1st day of April 2002. I started my high school in 2017 then completed it in 2022 but it was not any easy. I did my passed my O' level with Symbol B in English Language C in Commerce C in Literature in English B in Geography C in Combined Science And a C in Indigenous Language. I proceeded to A level....and I got 7 points in an Art combination of History(e) Family and Religious Studies(B) Literature in English (D) It's very unfortunate that my father passed on when I was about to go for form 1 and I had noone to pay for my fees...which was $55 per term. My mother and my father were divorced long back...my mother was and is still a housewife she has never been employed so paying for my fees was something she was totally incapable of doing. Thanks to my nephew whom I only saw once......he is the one who paid for my fees up until A' level but he is no longer capable of paying for my tertiary. The course I always wanted to go is Law. Since I was a little kid I always wished to be a lawyer one day. My weakness i am not so sure but as for my strength.... my strength is my bitter past and it keeps pushing me to looking forward for the best and I am a guy of optimism. My hobbies are singing and playing soccer.

72 - 22 Dec 2023 08:46AM - +263 71 349 0117: In 5 years after completion I would like to give back to my country to boost productivity and help to reduce hunger and poverty through sustainable farming practises that will result in improved pest control and draught challenges  Since biotechnology skills can be applied in various industries, I see myself volunteering to partner with various organizations which are advocating for reducing hunger and poverty so as coming up with ways that may assist Africa as a region in improving food security and also to preserve and store harvested food thereby reducing imports.  I would also see myself contributing immensely in the research companies or the government trying to develop the best ways to be more productive like researching on the ways to produce crops that will give higher yields, crops that can resist or tolerate diseases so that we will be very productive  Furthermore, I would also want to play part in various industries such as engineering since biotechnology involves a lot of disciplines that may be useful in this Zimbabwe to assist and finding solutions to the challenges that maybe face in the future that may include storage houses which are computerized  Since technology improves daily I would want to see myself staying relevant in this field. I will be doing the continuous career development because I want to be always up to date with the current affairs.  I also see myself as an educator. My wish is to inspire young generation of agricultural farmer and scientists about the best ways we can do   farming with the knowledge we would have acquired.  Growing up in a country that was failing to attain food security due to droughts, pest challenges, diseases, lack of knowledge. My vision was to ensure that the community attains food security and evade poverty. I see this program giving me an opportunity to attain my vision that I had about my community and career development wise.

Even though I sometimes think it's too big of a dream, I still intend to bring a platform where there can be ground for practical work, as well as attracting international expertise. During this year I have gone to the rurals to my former secondary school it's quite not impressive how behind they are , with no internet to connect to the various opportunities after secondary and even the awareness of their existence. It's sad how they do not get enlightened about how they can develop themselves into people who can contribute positively rather than getting married right after secondary. I was willing to carry out enlightenment sessions where I make then aware of what's out there in the world, unfortunately the periods were packed so the headmaster said I would have to try maybe during the holidays and I eventually got busy. But with an opportunity to come back as a better individual, I make a great role model and mentor. Even though I was to say I am to bring internet connection and computers to the school, there would be need for money, and now having the competency to work and earn, I can safely invest in the betterment of the education systems especially in the rural areas where I have seen terrible systems.

23 - 22 Dec 2023 09:58AM - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program.
24 - 22 Dec 2023 09:58AM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
25 - 22 Dec 2023 09:58AM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
26 - 22 Dec 2023 09:58AM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert‚Äôs, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
27 - 22 Dec 2023 09:58AM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?

221 - 22 Dec 2023 09:27AM - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students.  Don‚Äôt you think so?
222 - 22 Dec 2023 09:29AM - +263 78 208 8260: I do think so sir
223 - 22 Dec 2023 09:29AM - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
224 - 22 Dec 2023 09:30AM - +263 78 208 8260: Oky sir
225 - 22 Dec 2023 09:30AM - Gurvinder: Chido basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation  If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.  *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).  *Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.  *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*

226 - 22 Dec 2023 09:30AM - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.

228 - 22 Dec 2023 09:57AM - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.  Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?

231 - 22 Dec 2023 10:02AM - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
232 - 22 Dec 2023 10:02AM - Gurvinder: Alright Chido, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.  Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.",No,Yes

52 - 22 Dec 2023 09:41AM - Gurvinder: Member, I wanted to discuss an exciting opportunity that a Bachelor of Arts in Geography presents, particularly regarding a career in the mining industry.  Geography plays a pivotal role in the mining sector. Understanding the earth's surface, terrain, and the distribution of resources is fundamental in mining operations. Here's why a BA in Geography could be a valuable asset for your future in mining:  Spatial Analysis: Geography offers insights into spatial analysis, which is crucial in identifying optimal locations for mining sites, assessing geological formations, and understanding terrain variations that impact mining activities.  Resource Management: Studying Geography equips you with knowledge of natural resource distribution. This includes understanding mineral deposits, water resources, and environmental factors critical for sustainable mining practices.  Environmental Impact Assessment: Mining operations often have environmental implications. A Geography background provides expertise in assessing and managing these impacts, ensuring responsible and eco-friendly mining practices.  Geospatial Technology: Geography programs often cover geospatial technologies like GIS (Geographic Information Systems) and remote sensing. These tools are extensively used in the mining industry for mapping, exploration, and monitoring purposes.  Global Perspective: Geography offers a broad understanding of global landscapes, cultures, and economic factors. This broader perspective is invaluable in navigating international mining operations and understanding diverse market landscapes.  By pursuing a BA in Geography, you'll acquire a versatile skill set that aligns perfectly with the needs of the mining industry. Your knowledge of spatial analysis, resource management, and environmental considerations will be invaluable assets in this field.

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

Please type your answers in the group directly.  2. For MCQ Questions you can directly type the options  3. If you have any doubts regarding the test or any information, you can ask without hesitation. --------------------------------------------------------  SECTION 1:- PERSONAL INFORMATION  Name as per School Record- Prince Chishanga  Gender- Male  Date of Birth as per School Record- 03-11-2005  Father's Name- Richard  Mother's Name-  Viana  Email Address- pchishanga2020@gmail.com  Parent's email address-  richardchishanga1@gmail.com  Course:Bachelor of Computer applications  Intake Year: 2024  Country : South Africa   SECTION 2 READING TEST  Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage. If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‚Äò gather resolution from despair‚Äô but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.  1. The title that best suits the passage would be:  d) The Miracle of Confronting Danger  2.A man may react to sudden danger in three different ways . What are they?  c) He may be paralyzed with fear, or seized with panic, or as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, and face the danger.   3.What is the meaning of the word debilitating ? a) enfeeble   4. Explain the phrase ‚Äògather resolution from danger‚Äô. . d) To be enthusiastic and brave the odds.  5. The author feels happy in the recollection of dangers faced and overcome because  b) They added a new perspective and lifted him above himself for a time.   SECTION 3 LANGUAGE TEST  Each passage below is accompanied by a number of questions. For some questions, you will consider how the passage might be revised to improve the expression of ideas. For other questions, you will consider how the passage might be edited to correct errors in sentence structure, usage, or punctuation. A passage or a question may be accompanied by one or more graphics (such as a table or graph) that you will consider as you make revising and editing decisions. Some questions will direct you to an underlined portion of a passage. Other questions will direct you to a location in a passage or ask you to think about the passage as a whole. After reading each passage, choose the answer to each question that most effectively improves the quality of writing in the passage or that makes the passage conform to the conventions of standard written English. Many questions include a ‚ÄúNO CHANGE‚Äù option. Choose that option if you think the best choice is to leave the relevant portion of the passage as it is.  Whey to Go Greek yogurt‚Äîa strained form of cultured yogurt‚Äîhas grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent.

Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

SECTION 6 PERSONALITY TEST ""My Inspirational Story""  *The examiner will use your composition to analyze your personality traits. USE AT LEAST 400 WORDS.*  My High School Journey: Overcoming Friendship Challenges and Building Connections   At the beginning of my high school journey, I faced various challenges in navigating friendships and building connections. High school friendships extend beyond the classroom, and it became apparent to me that these external connections were just as significant as those formed within the school environment. The stages of relationship development, from initiating to bonding, played a crucial role in shaping my experiences during this time.  As I reflect on my high school years, I find it important to highlight the impact of friendship dynamics on adolescents with varying levels of self-esteem. The challenges of school transitions, the initiation and dissolution of friendships, and maintenance strategies were all crucial aspects of my journey. The interviews conducted for this chapter have provided insights into the significance of friendships as contexts for self-exploration and validation, especially in relation to levels of trust, loyalty, and support.  Throughout my high school journey, the importance of peer friendship and communication became evident, not only in my personal life but also in my academic experiences. The positive and negative experiences I encountered shed light on how universities can enhance the overall student experience. Learning to navigate the complexities of friendships and connections has been a profound part of my growth during high school, and I am eager to share my journey of overcoming these challenges and building meaningful connections. As I conclude my high school journey, I am reminded of the invaluable lessons learned through navigating friendships and building connections. The impact of friendship dynamics on adolescents with varying levels of self-esteem has been a significant part of my experience. The challenges and transitions that come with high school have further solidified the understanding of the importance of peer relationships in shaping socialization during adolescence.  Throughout this journey, it has become evident that the quality of friendships plays a crucial role in individuals' social adjustment and stress management. My experiences have highlighted the positive influence of high-quality friendships in building self-esteem and supporting personal growth during this pivotal stage of life.   Looking ahead, I believe that the insights gained from my high school journey will continue to guide me in forming and maintaining positive peer relationships in the future. As I move forward, I am eager to apply these lessons to further enhance my personal development and contribute to a positive and supportive social environment.   All the best for your Scholarship Test.

Mostly, all companies in India have a unique letter head and watermarks for their documents and they also include a complete address office. ¬∞It is also advised to request the national id for local bank accounts so you can confirm if the details match. ¬∞ The organisation must have futuristic goals for your career and they must use mentorship and guidance counselling as one of their tools in ensuring your future.

Over 16 years after the genocide, Rwanda's local communities remained severally affected by the experience of violence and attempts to overcome the legacy of this past represent a major challenge. Unsurprisingly, people who lived through the genocide against Tutsi and moderate Hutu, and through the 1990-94 war between the Habyarimana government and the Rwandan Patriotic Front, remember their past differently with their memories being informed by their role then and their current situation. However, the Rwandan memoryscape is not simply informed by recollection, it is also shaped by forgetting. Although at present  the deliberate eclipsing of particular memories, what I term chosen amnesia, may be essential for enabling community cohesion and facilitating the coexistence necessary for the social transformation that would render ethnicity- based violence impossible, as it prevents the social cleavages   that allowed the genocide to occur from being challenged.  Survivors and their families continue to present with considerable rates of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and substantial depressive and anxiety symptomd. The data revealed a strong association between health problems and psychological factors such as social integration. Many women suffered the consequences of rape and sexual violence. Thousands of children were orphaned and had to fend for themselves. However, Rwanda has managed to rebuild itself in the aftermath of that tragedy, setting itself apart from other developing nations  by efficiently and transparently making the most of other nations' investments and creating the building blocks of success in agriculture, social services, entrepreneurship and basic infrastructure.
254 - 21 Dec 2023 07:03PM - +263 78 827 8861: SECTION 6 MY INSPIRATIONAL STORY  Once upon a time, there was a young person who had a dream. She wanted to makes difference in the world, but she did not know how. She tried many things, but nothing seemed to work. She felt like giving up, but she knew she had to keep going. One day, she met someone who inspired her to keep pursuing her dreams. She took the advice and never gave up, and eventually was able to make her dreams come true. This girl is non other than myself. In one moment things grew tough and I let my guard down, letting go of all the dreams I had. One early morning, as I was reading a book called ''THE SLIGHT EDGE'' by Jeff Olson. The words on the pages seemed to jump out at me, as if they were speaking directly to me. I could not put the book down, and when I finished reading it, I felt a sense of clarity and purpose that I had never felt before.  Jeff Olson emphasized on how everything you do everyday matter more. Therefore, the key to achieving your goal is to take simple actions. I thought and wondered on what I was passionate about and o sought to being creative and designing. I had a liking to fashion designs and I would always watch fashion shows on the television . I got fascinated about designing and I linked it with my creativeness and I wanted to be a fashion designer, as I thought to myself. I saw this as a way of opening up to new experience and perspectiveness  and the idea of allowing mistakes and embracing failure as a learning opportunity and taking risks. The moral of the story is that it is never too late  to pursue your dreams and that with perseverance

59 - 22 Dec 2023 01:28PM - Kunal: Alright Bhekumuzi Please share what you have understood from the document in detail
60 - 22 Dec 2023 02:00PM - +263 71 375 1398: 1.I understood that some people think and assume that a scholarship is a charitable organization which is said to be not true, one should also understand that the $10 million scholarship fund is not from a charitable organization but it is from a parent company by the name of Anhad Edutrain Solutions which was brought about in 2009  2. I understood that India is recommended for having English as the primary medium of communication and its cultural way of living And India is also recommended for its Hospitable and friendly citizens 3. I also picked on that after obtaining a scholarship you still will be having $2000 - $3000 cost and expenses per year and this is after Edoofa has found you eligible for the scholarship 4. I also understood that there is a program known as the Earn while you learn program where one is assigned to real time projects in which your efforts after completing the assignment earn you scholarship credits that help in covering part of your school fees and also the assignments live you with lifelong experiences in certain work fields 5. I also picked on that international students are not allowed to work part-time or full-time jobs as they came into the country with study visas and not work visas 6. Another aspect I understood was that of the admission process which consist of six stage namely 1.Personalized counseling sessions, 2.Eligibility check test and interview, 3. Acceptance into the Edoofa program, 4.Enrollment into the Edoofa program, admission process after the enrollment into Edoofa program and lastly 6. Admission letter and visa 7. I also understood that there are over 250+ universities in which one could get admitted into ,and all universities being government recognized 8. Another important factor I understood is that when one misses the deadlines which are very crucial their offer letters are to be revoked but that doesn't affect the eligibility of the student and that can be rectified and discussed with your counselor and the academic board  And I also picked a few wonderful remarks from the Edoofian student community where some students share their wonderful experiences with them being part of the Edoofa scholarship program.

37 - 22 Dec 2023 10:00AM - +263 71 779 8387: Well I have 2 of my friends who are being funded by the edoofa scholarship. One of them explained how good the lecturers are and how welcoming they all are. There's no racism and all the students are the same. This really made me want to have my tertiary education there. As for Kelvin, he told me the way of life there and he's experiences at the University....he explained to me the way of living and how they are being properly taken care of. The pass rates are great according to kelvin and the part time jobs are also great . This made me become solid on the decision to have my tertiary studies in India.

114 - 22 Dec 2023 11:41AM - Kunal: Indeed If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  *NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.

290 - 22 Dec 2023 11:40AM - Pallika Edoofa: Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months this year and let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
291 - 22 Dec 2023 11:40AM - Pallika Edoofa: At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self-sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program. We also ensure they develop employability skills so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate. I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your child‚Äôs career, aren't you?
292 - 22 Dec 2023 11:47AM - +263 77 268 6147: That's a fantastic approach,I think it will work that way.Earn while You Learn is a better approach because it eases our financial tension,",No,Yes

154 - 22 Dec 2023 11:34AM - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5*: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.    *August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*    This registration fee($500-$1000) isn‚Äôt an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year‚Äôs Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

403 - 22 Dec 2023 03:38PM - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.  So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
404 - 22 Dec 2023 03:38PM - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-  BANK NAME: FBC  SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA  ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA  ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828  CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854

350 - 22 Dec 2023 03:27PM - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
351 - 22 Dec 2023 03:43PM - +27 60 341 3656: Phase 1 I guess
352 - 22 Dec 2023 03:46PM - Sahil Edoofa: Well , We had also discussed the Acceptance Letter which a student  receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is the stage 4.  *In Step 1:Connect with counselor-* As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit based Scholarship.  *In Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test  *Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!  *Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.  We are left with 5 and 6. So shall I explain it to you?
353 - 22 Dec 2023 04:49PM - +27 60 341 3656: Yes please
354 - 22 Dec 2023 05:13PM - Sahil Edoofa: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.  This registration fee($500-$1000) isn‚Äôt an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year‚Äôs Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).  Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$1000) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.  I hope you are clear with the process?

358 - 22 Dec 2023 08:31PM - Sahil Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-  *1. About the EDOOFA Program and it‚Äôs vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*  *2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*  *3.

So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.  So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
410 - 22 Dec 2023 12:25PM - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-  BANK NAME: FBC  SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA  ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA  ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828  CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854

431 - 22 Dec 2023 08:52PM - Sahil Edoofa: I appreciate your thoughtful consideration regarding the timeline for the August 2025 intake. Opting for early enrollment brings forth several noteworthy advantages:  Exclusive Access to Scholarships: Edoofa scholarships are in high demand, and early enrollment ensures that your child has exclusive access to the financial support offered by our scholarship program.  Seat Assurance: Early enrollment guarantees your child a confirmed seat in the program, eliminating any potential competition for seats as the intake date approaches. This proactive approach ensures a smooth and stress-free admission process.  Ample Time for Preparation: The one and a half years leading up to the August 2025 intake provide a generous timeframe for meticulous preparation. This spans document verification, visa processing, and any academic preparations needed, contributing to a seamless transition.  Strategic Financial Planning: Enrolling early facilitates strategic financial planning. You gain the flexibility to explore various funding options, including the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) program, enabling you to establish a robust and stable financial plan for your child's education.  Fee Consistency Guarantee: Early enrollment secures the current fees, offering a consistent and predictable cost structure throughout the course. This shields against potential fee increases in the future.  Furthermore, admission for the August 2025 Intake opens up an opportune period for your child to make the most of this time:  Early Engagement in EWYL Program: A head start of over 20 months provides your child with a distinct advantage in the EWYL program. This time allows for a comprehensive understanding of projects and assignments, enabling the earning of scholarship credits even before arriving in India.(For example even if your child earns $100 a month he or she can self finance entire before even coming to India like many student often do let me share video of one such student )  Effective Communication with Admissions Team: Parents can proactively engage with the Admissions Team, focusing on financial planning and addressing any potential challenges. This proactive approach ensures a well-prepared international education journey for your child.  Community Integration: Becoming part of the Edoofa community early on allows students to connect with high achievers and toppers in their respective fields. This interaction proves invaluable for academic queries, potentially reducing the need for additional tuitions hence saving your cost for tutors.  Considering these factors, early enrollment not only secures the scholarship but also provides a substantial timeframe for thorough preparation and strategic planning.

Delays in taking action might lead to the loss of an academic year, potentially resulting in challenges reminiscent of those your parents faced due to rising inflation. Taking wise steps toward education is crucial, as failure to do so could make it difficult to put food on the table. As an educationist, I share a harsh truth of the world and provide resources for verification.

342 - 22 Dec 2023 02:32PM - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.  So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.

263 - 22 Dec 2023 02:35PM - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.  I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
264 - 22 Dec 2023 02:35PM - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-  1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.  2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program.  Or  A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
265 - 22 Dec 2023 02:35PM - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India  I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.

467 - 22 Dec 2023 12:28PM - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 2:* Once the student's complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
468 - 22 Dec 2023 12:28PM - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
469 - 22 Dec 2023 12:28PM - Shubham Madhwal: *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
470 - 22 Dec 2023 12:28PM - Shubham Madhwal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*

473 - 22 Dec 2023 01:17PM - Shubham Madhwal: Early financial planning for tertiary education is crucial for parents for several reasons:  *Cost of Education:* Tertiary education, including college or university, can be expensive. Tuition fees, books, accommodation, and other associated costs can add up significantly. Planning allows parents to save and budget for these expenses, reducing the financial burden when the time comes.
474 - 22 Dec 2023 01:17PM - Shubham Madhwal: *Time Horizon:* Tertiary education typically takes several years to complete. By starting to save early, parents have a longer time horizon to accumulate the necessary funds.
475 - 22 Dec 2023 01:17PM - Shubham Madhwal: *Financial Stability:* By planning early, parents can avoid financial stress and debt. Without proper planning, they may have to rely on loans or other high-cost financing options, which can lead to long-term financial challenges. SAVE YOURSELF FROM LOANS  *INTERNSHIPS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK:* Early planning can also involve students participating in projects that will be offered by the EWYL Department of Edoofa after Induction which can help offset the cost of education. These opportunities often have application deadlines, so planning allows parents to take advantage of them.  *Teach Financial Responsibility:* Involving children in the financial planning process can teach them valuable lessons about money management, savings, and responsibility. It helps instill good financial habits from an early age.
476 - 22 Dec 2023 01:17PM - Shubham Madhwal: *Avoiding Last-Minute Rush:* Delaying financial planning until the last minute can lead to rushed decisions and inadequate savings. Early planning provides a more thoughtful and organized approach.  *Goal Setting:* Setting specific financial goals for education allows parents to track their progress and adjust their savings strategies as needed. It provides a clear roadmap for achieving the desired educational outcomes.
477 - 22 Dec 2023 01:17PM - Shubham Madhwal: *Peace of Mind:* Knowing that you have a financial plan in place for your child's education can provide peace of mind. It reduces uncertainty and allows parents to focus on other aspects of their child's development without constant worry about funding education.

478 - 22 Dec 2023 01:17PM - Shubham Madhwal: In conclusion, early financial planning for tertiary education is essential for parents to ensure that they can provide their children with quality education without compromising their own financial stability. It allows for more effective financial management and better opportunities for both parents and students.

As your counsellor, I can only recommend you to try and complete the formalities a day or two prior to the deadline so that such issues are avoided and you as parents do not have to be stressed regarding the same!

So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $80 to $100 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr Shorwi's Account.

187 - 22 Dec 2023 04:34PM - Shubham Madhwal: *To understand it better, the cost of $2000 to $3000 per year which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester-wise (2 semesters in a year) after the student arrives at the University.*

190 - 22 Dec 2023 04:55PM - Shubham Madhwal: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this, we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program*  Before moving on ahead, Do you have any questions regarding the information shared with you so far?
191 - 22 Dec 2023 05:59PM - +260 763007542: No sir
192 - 22 Dec 2023 06:00PM - Shubham Madhwal: So shall I now brief you about the Earn While You Learn Prorgam?
193 - 22 Dec 2023 06:01PM - +260 763007542: Yes please
194 - 22 Dec 2023 06:03PM - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing ‚Äì just to name a few.

261 - 22 Dec 2023 06:17PM - Shubham Madhwal: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.  I hope you can now realize how we are different isn‚Äôt it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
262 - 22 Dec 2023 06:20PM - +260 763007542: As you do you earn as you learn program do you do something related to your course or something that you are personally interested in?

245 - 22 Dec 2023 11:47AM - Shubham Madhwal: That's really good. Now as I have mentioned about the various benefits that you get once you enrol with Edoofa earlier, did I tell you that a student also saves around $1000-$1500 in College Application fees when affiliated with Edoofa?
246 - 22 Dec 2023 11:50AM - +260 97 1819712: Yes you did mention about it.
247 - 22 Dec 2023 11:52AM - Shubham Madhwal: Let me tell you For Admission forms, a student on average may end up paying *$1000-$1500*. For a Statement of Purpose (SOP), the cost is between *$300-$500*. Edoofa also helps you with Visa Documentation, University Selection, and sessions, Seels Learning Centre (SLC) classes, etc, All these facilities would cost you more than *$2000* without Edoofa, but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad *for only $350*. This $350 is the Edoofa enrollment fee.
248 - 22 Dec 2023 11:58AM - +260 97 1819712: Well understood Sir.
249 - 22 Dec 2023 12:00PM - Shubham Madhwal: Please *The enrollment fee is charged to you for*:  1. Edoofa provides foster care to all its students. This is more like a family with health insurance, mentor assistance, and counsellor help. The enrollment fee includes the Application forms, SOPs, visa assistance, University sessions, etc  2. We offer a comprehensive training program on Employability Skills for the entire course. The Earn While You Learn Program, is a department where the child learns skills and also gets an opportunity to earn $50-$100 per month.  3. The guaranteed 50-100% Scholarship we offer to our students.
253 - 22 Dec 2023 12:20PM - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation  If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
254 - 22 Dec 2023 12:20PM - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).

95 - 22 Dec 2023 10:09AM - +263 77 578 9886: I have gone through the facts that you have sent they are so encouraging and outstanding
96 - 22 Dec 2023 10:45AM - Tushti: So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
97 - 22 Dec 2023 10:47AM - +263 77 578 9886: No we aren't  familiar of it and if you are at Liberty may you familiaries us with it
98 - 22 Dec 2023 10:55AM - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
99 - 22 Dec 2023 10:55AM - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

100 - 22 Dec 2023 10:55AM - Tushti: <Media omitted>
101 - 22 Dec 2023 10:55AM - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:  *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*
102 - 22 Dec 2023 10:56AM - Tushti: In simple words Ashley, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

107 - 22 Dec 2023 11:59AM - Tushti: Now let me brief you about the EWYL PRogram
108 - 22 Dec 2023 11:59AM - Tushti: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing ‚Äì just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional.

But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

My per term fees was also $600 at John Tallach High School in Matabeleland North. I am an innovative girl with hopes to initiate change wherever I am, it may not necessarily be limited to aviation. I enjoy  mathematical  subjects and extra curricula activities such as debate, poetry and public speaking. I like art as far as leisure is concerned. I think I'd say my weakness is keeping my peace when I have power to correct a wrong.

I had always dreamt of being an aerospace engineer because it has so much room for innovation and advancement. It had always just been a fantasy because it is not a programme offered in Zimbabwe and the costs of doing it abroad would be overburdening for my parents.

43 - 22 Dec 2023 11:47AM - +263 77 259 7838: That is the reason why we are looking for full time scholarship
44 - 22 Dec 2023 11:56AM - Tushti: @263772597838 let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.  *1. Scholarships* *2. Sponsorships*  Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.  Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
45 - 22 Dec 2023 02:07PM - +263 78 075 4748: Thanks for the elaboration. I was actually one of the students you mentioned who didn't know the difference. But now I do

41 - 22 Dec 2023 11:06AM - Tushti: *Bachelor in Psychology* is a 3-year undergraduate course.  *What is a Bachelor in Psychology course?*  In Bachelor in Psychology, students learn mainly about the processing of the human mind and human behaviour. They study how humans behave differently in different circumstances while dealing with different sets of people. On the basis of this, various conclusions are drawn.  *What is it about?*  Psychology, in simple terms, is the study of human mind and human behavior. A student of psychology has to study how a human mind works in different situations, how it develops perception, what are the various circumstances and how they affect the development of human behavior. Although psychology is introduced at school level in India, it is only at the college level when one learns the basic theories and applications related to Psychology and Psychoanalysis. Psychology courses at the undergraduate level are generally application based and prepare students for entry level jobs in related fields.  BA Psychology is ideal for students who have a leaning towards Arts and Social Sciences and are willing to take up an in-depth study of psychology.  *Career Prospects*  What can you do with a BA degree in Psychology?  The graduates of BA Psychology have a lot of opportunities ahead, both in academics and in the job sector.  *Jobs*  The graduates of this course get various opportunities to work in many different fields in both the private sector and the government sector. They get work in departments like hospitals, educational institutes, corporate organizations, etc. Some of the profiles which are open for them are Social Worker, Sales Representative, Recruiters, Teachers, etc.
42 - 22 Dec 2023 11:08AM - +263 78 175 6528: Okay thank you
43 - 22 Dec 2023 11:52AM - Tushti: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
44 - 22 Dec 2023 11:52AM - Tushti: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 80 to 100 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa‚Äôs Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?

37 - 22 Dec 2023 02:49PM - Tushti: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
