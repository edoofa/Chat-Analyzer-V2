How are you?

I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
15/09/23, 4:30 pm - Saloni Edoofa: In case you, as a student, are not available, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Tuesday and Friday* from *12:30  PM to 01:30 PM*⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.
17/09/23, 9:45 am - +263 78 088 1020: Thankyou

How are you?

Let's begin with our session🥳
22/09/23, 12:53 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Mufarowashe can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
22/09/23, 1:33 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would end the session here and we would like to have the next session on Tuesday in the coming week, till then have a great weekend!

I encourage you to explore our weekly newsletters. These newsletters serve as a direct connection between our founder, Mr. Angad Singh, and all of our fellow Edoofians. It's a powerful medium through which we can learn from his experiences and wisdom. Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to our session next week.

May we begin with our session?
06/10/23, 12:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I've noticed that both Mufarowashe and the parents haven't been available for the Fastrack sessions we had planned. I understand that life can be unpredictable, and there might be challenges you're facing that are affecting your availability. Could you please share the specific obstacles or constraints you're encountering? This way, I can provide assistance and support tailored to your needs.

How are you?
13/10/23, 12:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I want to express my concern about the Fastrack sessions we had planned. Despite my consistent efforts to schedule these sessions and reminders, I've noticed neither Mufarowashe nor the parents are available. This lack of engagement has raised concerns about the progress and opportunities for Mufarowashe career development.
13/10/23, 12:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Active and involved parents can greatly encourage their students to excel, and I believe that with your participation, Mufarowashe potential can be fully realized. I'm genuinely interested in understanding the challenges you may be facing so that I can assist you accordingly and ensure a bright future for Mufarowashe. Your involvement in this process is incredibly valuable, and I'm here to support you every step of the way. Please share your thoughts and any obstacles you might be encountering so we can work together effectively.
16/10/23, 12:20 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good day!
I trust you're doing well.

Hope you are doing well.

_Our Edoofians in India lit up Diwali, the Festival of Lights_, with unmatched enthusiasm. From radiant diyas to vibrant rangoli, their classrooms and homes sparkled with festive joy🪔. Embracing cultural diversity, students and teachers adorned themselves in traditional attire, fostering a sense of unity. The spirit of giving shone through charity initiatives, and the night sky dazzled with spectacular fireworks💥. This Diwali celebration wasn't just a festival; it was a vibrant tapestry of tradition, unity, and joy, creating unforgettable memories for our Edoofian family! Have a look at it👇🏼

I sincerely hope you're well. It's been a while since we last connected, and as I see many of my students eagerly resuming their EWYL journey after completing their exams, it brings back memories of your passion and enthusiasm when you started yours.

I can't help but wonder why we've lost touch. Your dedication to your goals was inspiring, and your journey holds a special place in my heart. As your mentor, I'm genuinely concerned about your well-being and progress. Please, if there's anything on your mind, don't hesitate to share. I'm here to support you in any way I can.

From tomorrow until Monday, our entire team will also be immersed in the festivities, celebrating this time with our families. We will resume our sessions from Tuesday onwards from 10:00-11:00 AM🕜.

I, your proud mentor, Ms. Saloni, want to wish you a Merry Christmas🎁. It would have been amazing if I were there with you in person, but I sincerely wish you all the happiness, love, joy, and cozy family time, and, yes, may all your wishes come true, just like mine did by having you as my wonderful student🥺♥️

Happy holidays! I am sure you are going to make the most of this time. 

And, wait, don't forget to share pictures of your celebration with me. 📸
