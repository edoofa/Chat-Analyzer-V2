20/12/23, 1:52 pm - +267 74 051 442: My long term goals are driven my experience in life up until now . I have seen a lot of people succumbing to cancer . I lost someone close to me to cancer . So my long term goal is l would like to start my own cancer treatment and research center where people are given awareness about cancer and Hope that people can survive with cancer . I would really not want someone to go through the pain l went through , not if l can make a change through this chance l will have after completing my studies. The EWYL program plays a very important role in achieving my goal because its a way to build my social skills and also my business skills . It can also connect me with a lot of successful people and it will expose me to the digital world
20/12/23, 1:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I truly appreciate your heartfelt and impactful long-term goal. Your desire to establish a cancer treatment and research center, coupled with the personal experience of losing someone close to cancer, reflects a genuine commitment to making a positive change. The EWYL program is an excellent choice to support your aspirations, providing a platform to develop essential social and business skills. By connecting you with successful individuals and exposing you to the digital world, the program can undoubtedly play a crucial role in paving the way for your vision🫱🏻‍🫲🏼🫶🏻

20/12/23, 2:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
20/12/23, 2:10 pm - +267 74 051 442: I am not aware of them Ma'am
May you  enlighten me
20/12/23, 2:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
20/12/23, 2:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
20/12/23, 2:16 pm - +267 74 051 442: Thank you l undertsand them now
20/12/23, 2:16 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me share with you that Persistance, one of my students has _earned around 7,000 USD_ and paid his entire tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.

20/12/23, 2:27 pm - +267 74 051 442: I'm inspired in a way that it is possible to pay for the entire school fees with scholarship credits 
I would really love to archive the same way .
