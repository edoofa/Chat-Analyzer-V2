I hope you're doing good.

I am absolutely overwhelmed with joy as I take you on a journey through the highlights of our recent orientation event for our "Proud Edoofians" at our partner universities🤩. This event was a wonderful experience, with Team Edoofa meeting the most amazing bunch of students. We embarked on a delightful journey together, engaging in discussions about our weekly lessons, engaging activities, exciting projects, the path to employability, and the importance of discipline.🚀

We didn't stop there; our hearts swelled with pride as we had the privilege of not only inspiring but also educating our Edoofians about the vibrant and diverse culture of India🇮🇳. And to top it all off, we concluded the event with an explosive burst of happiness, as our Edoofians danced, sang, and lived in the moment. We captured countless pictures of these unforgettable moments, and I'm so happy to share some of these heartwarming memories with you! 🎉📸

How are you?

Since I want you to have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and focus on your exams. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me. <This message was edited>
08/09/23, 9:58 am - Saloni Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Deepali, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till ___ (date) because I am having my exams from __ to ___ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Saloni as soon as I get over with my exams.
(Attach your date sheet along with this.)
Send it to - deepali@edoofa.com, and saloni.edoofa@gmail.com, ewyl@edoofa.com


Once done, please let me know.
14/09/23, 3:49 pm - +263 78 706 9627: Okay thank you ma'am
16/09/23, 10:25 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
16/09/23, 10:25 am - Saloni Edoofa: If you are not available as a student, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Saturday* from *08:00 AM - 09:30 AM* from next week onwards⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.
16/09/23, 10:03 pm - +263 78 706 9627: Can you please add my father's number +263712597989
21/09/23, 10:49 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day! I hope you're doing well.

I wanted to inform you that due to the _organization being closed this Saturday_, our next session will be rescheduled to the following week, specifically on *Wednesday, September 27, 2023* _12:00-01:00 PM_. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

In the meantime, I'd like to share my brief introduction video with you, which will provide some insight into who I am. Additionally, I encourage you to explore our weekly newsletters. These newsletters serve as a direct connection between our founder, Mr. Angad Singh, and all of our fellow Edoofians. It's a powerful medium through which we can learn from his experiences and wisdom. Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to our session next week.

16/10/23, 8:29 am - Saloni Edoofa: I can completely understand that but you just left with some basic formalities that need to be completed before I keep your Program on hold.
16/10/23, 8:30 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now there are some basic formalities that you need to follow.
16/10/23, 8:30 am - Saloni Edoofa: All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
16/10/23, 8:30 am - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
16/10/23, 8:30 am - Saloni Edoofa: You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
16/10/23, 8:31 am - Saloni Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
16/10/23, 8:31 am - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
16/10/23, 9:44 am - +263 71 259 7989: Noted
16/10/23, 9:46 am - +263 71 259 7989: We are all fine
17/10/23, 8:20 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day to our proud edoofian and parents!

I would appreciate it if you share your thoughts on the same once you read the above-shared newsletter.
Even parents can do it on behalf of the student.
17/10/23, 2:04 pm - +263 71 259 7989: We are good and proud edooofian and parents.
17/10/23, 2:12 pm - +263 71 259 7989: I have read the newsletter and I have motivated by the three quotes.I as a parent I agree with Henry Ford's belief of providing value before seeking value is a wise approach because inorder to reap some fruits there must be ground preparation before you saw so inlife we need to prepare very hard to enjoy tommorow.If we use this best approach in our lives we will never be disappointed because we will be prepared for everything good or bad.
17/10/23, 2:13 pm - +263 71 259 7989: However where there is good ground work before seeking value you never go wrong
17/10/23, 2:31 pm - +263 71 259 7989: The is also the issue of dealing with inferiority as is indicated by that girl  doing quiz it also shows that where the is zeal, passion and courage success is lying ahead so we have to believe in ourselves whenever doing things
18/10/23, 9:03 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day to our proud edoofian and parents!
18/10/23, 9:03 am - Saloni Edoofa: I wholeheartedly thank you for investing your valuable time in perusing our newsletter. Just as you've shown your support, we are committed to continuously delivering extraordinary newsletters from our side. Your engagement and enthusiasm are truly inspiring!
18/10/23, 9:25 am - +263 71 259 7989: Thank you
26/10/23, 5:52 pm - +263 71 259 7989: It's good to be proud of your religion and to value your customs and traditions since they are the foundations of what we are today.We have all to offer respect and honour to all these events
27/10/23, 12:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Waiting for this message
27/10/23, 2:50 pm - +263 71 259 7989: 👏

16/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 706 9627: When l read this document l understood the purpose of EWYL which is to offer high education which is Accessible , affordable and make us employable.There are  3 projects which are African schools education reform mission, community building and corporate alliances.The program is to help us achieve our career goals and work towards a bright future .
16/11/23, 1:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is amazing, you have got the main idea of the document!
16/11/23, 1:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
16/11/23, 1:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 706 9627: Okay ma'am

16/11/23, 2:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
16/11/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 706 9627: 😂 it's the third time l listen to the audio so it was just a reminder
16/11/23, 2:10 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Oh no worries Charity at all
16/11/23, 2:12 pm - +263 78 706 9627: The audio explains about the first project which is the corporate alliance . This project makes us understand and prepare about the markets we plan to end at the end of the course. Doing this project gives us a great opportunity to connect with big technically driven companies. To connect with the companies a LinkedIn account needs to be opened.
16/11/23, 2:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Amazing, thanks Charity. I’m happy with your understanding.
16/11/23, 2:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
16/11/23, 2:18 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 706 9627: Okay ma'am

There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
17/11/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 706 9627: Okay ma'am l will definitely do it tonight
17/11/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 706 9627: So when am choosing the company l just choose any with the required details
17/11/23, 2:16 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me share a brief on how these companies should be!
17/11/23, 2:16 pm - Saloni Edoofa: 1. _Avoid reaching out to large-scale companies._
2. The company can be _African or Indian_. If the company is Indian then it should have some operation or association in African nations.
3. The _target audience_ of the company should focus on youth. Domains- Ed-Tech, E-Commerce, Gaming, Skincare, Haircare, Cosmetics, Media/PR, Food and Beverages, etc.
4. The company should _not_ belong to these particular sectors:
- Manufacturing
- Finance
- Real Estate/Construction
- Energy Solutions
- Cloud services/Business solutions, etc.​
17/11/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 706 9627: Okay l understand
17/11/23, 2:18 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Do you have any questions about this, Charity? I can help you.
17/11/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 706 9627: For the moment l understood everything . If l do the project today and find some difficulty l will get back to you
17/11/23, 2:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is amazing!
17/11/23, 2:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *Charity, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Charity!
17/11/23, 2:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 706 9627: Okay ma'am

23/11/23, 1:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: What happened Charity, is everything alright?
23/11/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 706 9627: Everything is well ma'am. Thank you
It was just something that was supposed to be discussed urgently
23/11/23, 1:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is alright, I understand!
23/11/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: No there is nothing like that Charity, we will first get all the information about all three projects and then start working on it.
23/11/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So now can you share about you learned from it?
23/11/23, 1:42 pm - +263 78 706 9627: ohhh l didn't know

23/11/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 706 9627: This audio is about the community building project. The reason for the project is for us to  learn how to deliberate social media so  we offer African the opportunity to be part of Edoofa. The project encourage us to have a mind set of opportunities and sharing  them with the community so we can't gain skills and benefit in numbers. 
I get that l have to get hold students who have graduated from senior school and am supposed to used my networking and persuade the students to be part of the program.
23/11/23, 1:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That’s awesome- Charity, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.

23/11/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 706 9627: Okay ma'am
23/11/23, 2:00 pm - Saloni Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
23/11/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 706 9627: Wow that's really exciting
23/11/23, 2:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
23/11/23, 2:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Mentor-  *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Charity/Saloni/23NOV2023*
23/11/23, 2:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
23/11/23, 2:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
23/11/23, 2:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
23/11/23, 2:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
23/11/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 706 9627: This is going to be bad .
My schoolmates do not appreciate this . They have been discouraging each other to take the opportunity

23/11/23, 2:30 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The annual G20 summit, a gathering of leaders from major economies, welcomed the African Union as a full member during India's presidency, fostering hope for increased development and investment in Africa. My experience in India has broadened my understanding of the country's global impact, with Indian graduates leading major corporations worldwide. The emphasis on education and innovation here is inspiring, driving technological advancements. Culturally, India feels like home, and the diversity allows for harmonious coexistence of various religions. The ambition and drive of the Indian community serve as motivation, and the educational opportunities are vast. Edoofa played a crucial role in guiding my informed choice, and I encourage serious students to join with accurate information. As an African and Edoofian, I feel a responsibility to ensure deserving individuals benefit from educational opportunities.
23/11/23, 2:31 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You can share with the students, this one of the testimony of a student of came to India.

FIRST- Please note that your session will be on:

*TUESDAY and FRIDAY* from 12:00 - 01:30 PM
01/12/23, 2:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
01/12/23, 2:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.

01/12/23, 2:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
01/12/23, 2:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
01/12/23, 2:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
01/12/23, 2:14 pm - +263 71 543 2417: Got it
01/12/23, 2:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you do it, do let me know.
01/12/23, 2:15 pm - +263 71 543 2417: I have.
04/12/23, 8:20 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Charity!
How are you?

Please follow the daily ritual on the EWYL Line of saying 'I am a proud edoofian'.
05/12/23, 8:09 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Charity!

As the students reveled in the joy of their Secret Santa treasures, Santa Claus chuckled from afar, his heart aglow with the delight of making dreams come true. 💖❄️ Now, the question echoed through the town: "_What do YOU wish for from your Secret Santa this festive season?_" 🎄🎅
