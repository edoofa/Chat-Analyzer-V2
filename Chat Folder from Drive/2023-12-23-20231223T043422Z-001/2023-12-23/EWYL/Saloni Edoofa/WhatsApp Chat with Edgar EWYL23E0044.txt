How are you?
21/08/23, 7:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: Since the time you have come to India, things have changed enormously. New environment, new friends, new culture, new discipline, and so on. And therefore, being your proud mentor, I along with the entire EWYL Team, thought to reward you for coming such a long way with us and not just this, I want that you to continue putting more and more effort into reaching greater heights and to discuss the same, I have scheduled a call with you.

*DATE* - 21/08/2023, Today
*TIME* - 06:00-06:15 PM
*LINK TO THE CALL* -https://meet.google.com/gzy-aajv-yqe
21/08/23, 7:55 am - Saloni Edoofa: Well received this, thank you.
21/08/23, 8:32 am - +91 75269 32812: Good afternoon mam thank you
21/08/23, 2:30 pm - Saloni Edoofa: @263779601108 @917526932812 please join the call.
21/08/23, 2:31 pm - +91 75269 32812: Ok mam
21/08/23, 2:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Edgar, it was an amazing call with you and yes as discussed over the call I would appreciate you to share two things with me:

▪️Your journey back from Zimbabwe, through your counselors, EWYL Mentor, and then to LPU in the form of a *handwritten note on plain paper with clear handwriting* whose sample I will be sharing with you. The main idea of getting this from you is to inspire hundreds of other edoofians miles away who might think this is an impossible journey.

▪️Your understanding of the $300 plan as explained over the call.

Once both the things are done, your name will be approved for the $300 plan.
21/08/23, 3:00 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/08/23, 3:00 pm - Saloni Edoofa: A handwritten letter can be something like this (this is just a sample for you, don't copy-paste anything)
The letter has to be completely based on your personal experience
21/08/23, 3:03 pm - +91 75269 32812: Ok thank you mam
21/08/23, 3:25 pm - +91 75269 32812: <Media omitted>
21/08/23, 3:39 pm - +91 75269 32812: The Edoofa Scholarship Program has played a crucial role in ensuring that deserving students have access to quality education, irrespective of their financial background. The Edoofa scholarship program, dedicated to supporting talented students, aims to harness the potential of a $300 for each   student I will recruit into its fold, creating a positive effect on education and society.

 Many talented students often face financial barriers that prevent them from pursuing higher education. The $300 grant from the Edoofa scholarship program serves as a stepping stone for deserving students to enter the education landscape.

So this  $300 will be divided accordingly depending on how the recruited student will be paying the enrollment fee, registration and also when the student finally come to India. Si I will be getting $100 when the student complete the full enrollment fee of $350, then another $100 when the student pay the registration fee and finally another $100 when the student finally arrive in India.
22/08/23, 10:02 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Edgar!
How are you?
22/08/23, 10:08 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am so happy to receive this and I would want that as parent @263776755817 also acknowledges the same.
22/08/23, 10:09 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am truly touched by your heartfelt letter, and I want to commend you for sharing your incredible journey as an Edoofian. Your words are not just a reflection of your gratitude but also a testament to your dedication and enthusiasm.

Edoofa has played a significant role in transforming your dreams into reality. Your story of how Edoofa made studying abroad a reality for you is inspiring. Your commitment to demonstrating your appreciation through actions speaks volumes about your character and determination. As you mentioned, making a difference is a core principle, and I do not doubt that you will do just that.

I am deeply moved by the regard that you have given to me, thank you for that. I think a mentor is nothing without its bright students and I am blessed to have a student like you.

I am sure with the opportunity given, you will continue doing your best.
Thank you

11/10/23, 3:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So to ensure the same, we are planning that all the students whose forms you will share, will be shown your video *highlighting your journey and experience*. There we would be required to make a short video on the same.
11/10/23, 3:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: In case of the absence of video, your forms will not be counseling, due to lack of video and therefore, you will not be considered for the $300 plan.

11/10/23, 3:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That will be awesome!
11/10/23, 3:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The video has to be entirely about *your journey, starting from the counseling stage till your arrival*. You should share with the student that you paid your enrollment fee after getting eligible for the program and are informed about the cost of education in India before and after the Edoofa Scholarship which is far more affordable as compared to their home country.
11/10/23, 3:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please include:
a) *Your journey so far with the program,*
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) You highlighted the *importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with their counselor* and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Your* initial feedback on how life is different in India how your basic amenities are cheaper as compared to their homeland* (use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by yourselves and struggling with the process. 
f) *Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.*
11/10/23, 3:39 pm - +91 75269 32812: Can i also share pictures at the university

09/11/23, 1:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're amid Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali celebrates the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Celebrate Diwali by lighting Diya's🪔, and capture the moment by snapping a photo of your lit and amazing celebration.🤩 Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.❤️

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

15/11/23, 4:16 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

09/12/23, 6:47 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!

Best regards,
Ms. Saloni

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝

Best regards,
Ms. Saloni Rastogi

👉🏼 How will you maintain your performance this month to ensure that you stay in the eligible category?

Ans: _________________________________________________________________________________________________________

19/12/23, 3:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day,
Hope you are enjoying your first winter season in India! 🥶

I've received messages from you and other Edoofians at the University, expressing their focus on exam preparations. Considering your likely Christmas celebrations and festive engagements, the team and I thought it would be best to _relieve you from sessions until the end of December_. We plan to *resume our first session of the new year in the first week of January*. 😌
19/12/23, 3:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *Every week, I will connect with you for quick updates for 5-10 minutes*. Along with this, *you can share concerns with me Monday to Friday from 06:00-08:00 PM IST if needed🫶🏻*. I'll still be accepting student application forms and African school forms. If you _wish to schedule a one-on-one call for project-related doubts during this time, I'm more than happy to accommodate🫱🏻‍🫲🏼._ I hope you won't waste this time and stay focused on projects. I would appreciate it if you dedicate some time and show productivity during that period.

Best wishes, and enjoy the festive season!
19/12/23, 3:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Great job on submitting the form! I've forwarded it to our dedicated counseling team. Now, let's keep the momentum going by staying in close touch with the students and promptly addressing any questions or concerns they might have. Together, we're making a positive impact! 🌟
