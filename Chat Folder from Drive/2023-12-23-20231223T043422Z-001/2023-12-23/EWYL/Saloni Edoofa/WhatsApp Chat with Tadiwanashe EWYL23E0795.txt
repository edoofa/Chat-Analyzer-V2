21/10/23, 11:31 am - +263 77 358 5569 joined using this group's invite link
21/10/23, 11:08 am - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Tadiwanashe, I hope you are doing well. 
I am *Ms. Saloni* and I will be your *EWYL mentor* now.

How are you?
21/10/23, 11:09 am - +263 71 239 0648: I am fine thank you. How are you?
21/10/23, 11:09 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you.
21/10/23, 11:10 am - Saloni Edoofa: To fasten up our progress and to give you _my undivided attention_, I want to have our sessions at some scheduled time so that in that time slot I can pay all my notice and we can very soon move ahead.
I hope you don't have any problem with it.

You session is from *01:30 - 02:30 PM* from Monday to Friday.

Please let me know as soon as possible so that we can resume our sessions.
Am I so excited, hope you are too💯
21/10/23, 11:12 am - +263 71 239 0648: I have no problem at all.
21/10/23, 11:12 am - +263 71 239 0648: Of course I am excited 🤗
21/10/23, 11:22 am - Saloni Edoofa: We will commence our activities starting from Wednesday onward. 😊 Please note that I won't be available on Monday due to some personal commitments. On Tuesday, our services will not be operational as we will be observing Dussehra, an exciting Indian festival celebrated with grand effigies, fireworks, and vibrant processions that symbolize the victory of good over evil. 🎉 Dussehra is a dazzling spectacle of lights, dances, and traditions that bring families and communities together while also paying tribute to the epic triumph of Lord Rama over the demon king Ravana. 🏹🔥
21/10/23, 11:23 am - +263 71 239 0648: Oh noted. Enjoy your day thank you
21/10/23, 11:25 am - Saloni Edoofa: While Dussehra is a unique and culturally significant Indian festival, it can be related to the spirit of celebration and community found in many festivals around the world, including Zimbabwe. 🎉 Zimbabwe has its own rich tapestry of festivals, such as the Harare International Festival of the Arts (HIFA) and traditional celebrations like the Harare Agricultural Show. 🎪🌾 These festivals, like Dussehra, bring people together in a spirit of unity and celebration, fostering a sense of togetherness and cultural pride. 🤝
21/10/23, 11:25 am - Saloni Edoofa: Thank you so much!
21/10/23, 11:27 am - +263 71 239 0648: You're very welcome
25/10/23, 9:05 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning, Tadiwanashe!

I hope you're doing well. Just a friendly reminder that our scheduled session is today from 01:30 to 02:30 PM. I'm looking forward to connecting with you. See you then!

25/10/23, 9:56 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you.
25/10/23, 9:57 am - +263 71 239 0648: I have an exam at 1400hrs so I was wondering if it is possible that we reschedule
25/10/23, 10:06 am - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, I understand now. May I know if your parents can attend the session on your behalf, just for today?

I am sure all other days you will be able to attend the sessions.
25/10/23, 10:11 am - +263 71 239 0648: Yes they will be available😊
25/10/23, 10:13 am - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, great!

Then if we will begin the initial session with them and after your exam goes, you can go through our conversation that take an overview of the same.
25/10/23, 10:13 am - Saloni Edoofa: All the best for your exam Tadiwanashe🌟
25/10/23, 10:13 am - +263 71 239 0648: Thank you Ms Saloni. You have a great day as well
25/10/23, 10:14 am - Saloni Edoofa: You too, Tadiwanashe!

25/10/23, 10:16 am - Saloni Edoofa: Oh, it was amazing, my entire city was super crowded to see the celebration all around. Let me show you a glimpse of the same.

25/10/23, 10:21 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>

My name is Ms. Saloni and I am Tadiwanashe's EWYL Mentor. Can I have a short introduction of you @263778054603 ?
25/10/23, 11:24 am - +263 71 239 0648: Hmm I'm dying to see this in person 🥹🥹🥹
25/10/23, 12:10 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Next year for sure, you will be able to enjoy with your fellow edoofians🫶🏻
25/10/23, 12:28 pm - +263 77 805 4603: Yeah I am Mrs Hove , Tadiwanashe's mother. Glad to meet you ma'am.
25/10/23, 1:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let's begin with our session📍
25/10/23, 1:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am so happy to welcome you to the group, I am sure you will witness tremendous growth and splendid transition in Tadiwanashe as we move ahead in this journey🚀
26/10/23, 2:17 pm - +263 71 239 0648: Is there any chance we may start now🥺🥺🥺
26/10/23, 2:18 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Tadiwanashe, I hope you are aware that punctuality is a trait of a disciplined student and I am very well aware as I have heard about you from your counselor and admissions team that you are a very bright kid, but not being punctual can portray a bad impression on the other person and I don't want that to happen with you. 
I hope you got my point.
26/10/23, 2:20 pm - +263 71 239 0648: Yes I got your point I am very sorry, I was facing challenges with the network such that I had to go to the main office of my service provider to get it fixed.
26/10/23, 2:20 pm - +263 71 239 0648: Once again I am very very sorry, please forgive me
26/10/23, 2:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: No worries Tadiwanashe, please don't be sorry. I am glad that you realize it and I truly, from the bottom of my heart appreciate your sincerity.
26/10/23, 2:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please don't say sorry, for me your progress is important but I equally understand the challenges at that side.
26/10/23, 2:22 pm - +263 71 239 0648: Thank you for understanding.
26/10/23, 2:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You know Tadiwanashe, I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
26/10/23, 2:23 pm - +263 71 239 0648: I will try my best to make it rewarding.
26/10/23, 2:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, I am sure that together as a team, we will achieve everything🫶🏻
26/10/23, 2:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
26/10/23, 2:26 pm - +263 71 239 0648: The first one to join is my father, Mr Hove and the second one is my mother Mrs Hove. They are my parents as well as my sponsors in my education
26/10/23, 2:28 pm - +263 71 239 0648: Unfortunately they cannot connect with us this instant partly due to work, but I am sure that from Monday onwards they will be joining us.
26/10/23, 2:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Sure, no worries about the same.
26/10/23, 2:30 pm - +263 71 239 0648: Thank you so much for understanding
26/10/23, 2:30 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am sure they will witness an amazing transformation in your life🫶🏻
26/10/23, 2:30 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
26/10/23, 2:31 pm - +263 71 239 0648: I promise tomorrow I will be punctual. 🤞
26/10/23, 2:32 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am sure you will be without fail.
26/10/23, 2:32 pm - +263 71 239 0648: Have a good day.
27/10/23, 2:02 pm - +263 71 239 0648: Yes
27/10/23, 2:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am sure we both will achieve greater heights together in this journey👏🏼
27/10/23, 2:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
27/10/23, 2:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/10/23, 2:11 pm - +263 71 239 0648: I'm done.
27/10/23, 2:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: o may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
27/10/23, 2:14 pm - +263 71 239 0648: The motivational words under the Subtopic: 2 questions for you.
27/10/23, 2:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is amazing, I am elated to hear that📈
27/10/23, 2:18 pm - Saloni Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Tadiwanashe?
27/10/23, 2:19 pm - +263 71 239 0648: Sounds amazing and interesting 🤗
27/10/23, 2:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am so happy to hear that!
27/10/23, 2:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
27/10/23, 2:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/10/23, 2:23 pm - +263 71 239 0648: Crystal clear <This message was edited>
27/10/23, 2:25 pm - +263 71 239 0648: Since its only a few minutes before the end of the session, does it mean well discuss it tomorrow?
27/10/23, 2:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, this means we will discuss this on Monday!
27/10/23, 2:30 pm - +263 71 239 0648: Oh thank you. Please have a nice weekend.
27/10/23, 2:30 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Your sessions will be held from next week, Monday onwards from 01:30-02:30 PM.
No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.
Till then, have a great weekend🌺
27/10/23, 2:30 pm - +263 71 239 0648: Thank you
30/10/23, 2:20 pm - +263 71 239 0648: I understood that we want competent companies that are active. I also understood that we have to consider the functionality of that particular company thus the reason we have to observe how the websites and applications work. Competent companies must be competent on their online networks hence we have to follow up and learn from the company's social media platforms. The backgrounds of the companies gives us a better understanding of the company's drive.
30/10/23, 2:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Waiting for this message
30/10/23, 2:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Waiting for this message

30/10/23, 2:27 pm - +263 71 239 0648: So how will I explain to the companies about Edoofa?
30/10/23, 2:31 pm - +263 71 239 0648: One more question, can we just add another 30 minutes to today's session?
30/10/23, 2:32 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Waiting for this message
30/10/23, 2:33 pm - +263 71 239 0648: Thank you so much. Please enjoy the rest of your day
01/11/23, 1:25 pm - +263 71 239 0648: Good afternoon
01/11/23, 1:33 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon!

01/11/23, 1:38 pm - +263 71 239 0648: Okay I'm following
01/11/23, 1:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now, Tadiwananashe- we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
01/11/23, 1:52 pm - +263 71 239 0648: Okay, just give me a few minutes to go through everything
01/11/23, 1:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Sure Tadiwanashe!
01/11/23, 2:02 pm - +263 71 239 0648: I think I'm good to go. No questions we may proceed.
01/11/23, 2:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now, we are ready to move forward to an amazing journey!
01/11/23, 2:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please note a few things:
FIRST- Your session will be on *MONDAY and THURSDAY* from 12:00-01:30 PM.
01/11/23, 2:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
01/11/23, 2:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
01/11/23, 2:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
01/11/23, 2:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
01/11/23, 2:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
01/11/23, 2:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
01/11/23, 2:21 pm - +263 71 239 0648: Can you please share more about this one?
01/11/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The program structure which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on Monday and Thursday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
01/11/23, 2:29 pm - +263 71 239 0648: Very interesting.
01/11/23, 2:30 pm - +263 71 239 0648: However may I please be excused from next week's sessions?. I have exams for the greater part of the week.

07/11/23, 2:34 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello, my proud edoofian!
Hope you are doing well.

I want to extend my sincere apologies for my absence yesterday. I was entrusted with the responsibility of coordinating the grand orientation event that took place at one of our partner universities. It was an exhilarating experience, and the students displayed their enthusiasm by preparing some delightful surprises for us. This made the event truly worthwhile.
07/11/23, 2:34 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I acknowledge that we missed our sessions last week and yesterday. To make up for this, I have scheduled a special 1.5-hour session tomorrow, during which we will cover all the material we had planned to address. Our session will begin at 09:30 AM and conclude at 11:00 AM. This extended session will help us catch up on everything and ensure we continue making progress as planned.
Also, from Thursday onwards, we will be beginning our preparation for our festival Diwali, therefore our session for tomorrow will also make up for for session that would have been held on Thursday. I am sure you will attend the same on the *EWYL Line tomorrow*

How are you?
09/11/23, 11:13 am - Saloni Edoofa: Great job on submitting the form! I've forwarded it to our dedicated counseling team. Now, let's keep the momentum going by staying in close touch with the student and promptly addressing any questions or concerns they might have. Together, we're making a positive impact! 🌟
09/11/23, 12:47 pm - Saloni Edoofa: As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're amid Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

Once upon a frosty North Pole night, Santa Claus was feeling particularly mischievous. He decided to become a Secret Santa and spread the magic of surprise! With a twinkle in his eye, he selected a list of students from around the world to receive special gifts. 🎁🌍

In a cozy little town, a group of excited students discovered mysterious packages appearing on their doorsteps. The buzz of curiosity filled the air as they unwrapped their surprise gifts – each one perfectly tailored to their dreams and wishes! 🤩
As the students reveled in the joy of their Secret Santa treasures, Santa Claus chuckled from afar, his heart aglow with the delight of making dreams come true. 💖❄️ Now, the question echoed through the town: "_What do YOU wish for from your Secret Santa this festive season?_" 🎄🎅
