18/12/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: You look great!
18/12/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
Please note a few things:
FIRST- Your sessions will be on'
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
18/12/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days you will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
18/12/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
18/12/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
18/12/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Aditi, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
18/12/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
18/12/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
18/12/23, 2:32 pm - +263 71 228 1130: Ok ok, thank you, l get ot
18/12/23, 2:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Your session is on Tuesday and Friday from 09:30-11:00 AM. In your session, you are required to:
▪️Active participation in most of the sessions by being punctual and actively engaging in the discussions
▪️Follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' on the EWYL Line every day, every morning before 12 PM.
▪️Share your lesson and activity response before your session commences
▪️Sharing project updates
18/12/23, 2:34 pm - +263 71 228 1130: Ok ok noted
18/12/23, 2:36 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
18/12/23, 2:38 pm - +263 71 228 1130: I get it and l will try to do my best
