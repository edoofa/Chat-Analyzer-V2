Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect lately. Actually, we have initiated our orientation program in collaboration with our partner universities, which is why we were present at those institutions.
08/09/23, 4:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/09/23, 4:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I would recommend you consult your admissions officer for the same as they are the best people to guide you in this matter.
18/09/23, 8:29 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Students!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
18/09/23, 8:29 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on 
Saturdays at 8:30 am to 9:30 am

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
18/09/23, 2:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let us move forward by discussing the credits associate with the third project.

20/09/23, 2:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Takundanashe can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
20/09/23, 3:50 pm - +263 77 384 0518: We are on the same page Ms Ananya thank you

Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line everyday by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

As we immerse ourselves in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, Dussehra, and Durga Puja here in India this month, I can't help but be curious about the incredible *cultural festivals* you celebrate in your beautiful homeland. 🎉🕯️

I've shared stories about the festival of lights, the triumph of good over evil, and the worship of the divine feminine. However, you have never mentioned anything about your *culture and festivals*. Now, it's your turn to enlighten me about your favorite festivals from Africa!🌍🌞

 I am also excited to see some photos and videos from your festive time!  Let's embrace the spirit of *cultural exchange*, and let our screens be filled with the magic of your celebrations.🎆✨

30/10/23, 4:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, @263773840518 @263713644123 
I understand that you're currently dealing with exams, but I've shared a video with you to support your studies. As your mentor, I'm genuinely concerned about your progress and want to see you succeed in your examinations.

I must admit that I'm quite disappointed that there hasn't been a response from you. Communication is essential for us to work together effectively. If you have any concerns or questions, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Let's ensure we're on the same page and working toward your success.

31/10/23, 6:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa is an organization that fosters careers and empowers students to progress in a more positive direction, achieving the right balance of exposure and opportunities, alongside education, is essential for a student's overall growth.

With this principle in mind, I am thrilled to share how our students are balancing correctly between exposure and experience with their academics:

⭕A group of our students recently participated in a football tournament, and we are immensely proud to announce that they reached the competition's semifinals.

⭕Another group of students participated in a debate competition, and I am delighted to add that two of our students emerged as winners.

⭕Furthermore, our students regularly come together for interactive sessions with their fellow Edoofians, building stronger relationships and providing mutual support.
31/10/23, 6:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: ◾ Being your mentor, as you prepare to join us in India, I would like to know: What kind of skills or exposure would you want to be a part of during your time here?

I hope this message finds you well amidst the ongoing examinations. I'm excited to share some fantastic news with you regarding the recent orientation held at Edoofa's partner colleges.

In these orientation programs, the primary aim was to bridge the gap between students and mentors. It provided the valuable opportunity for each student to meet their respective mentor, a crucial connection that will guide them throughout their EWYL and overall Edoofa's journey.

The session delved deep into the Earn While You Learn program, a path to financial independence while pursuing your education. We discussed strategies to maximize scholarship credits, ensuring our students make the most of this opportunity.

Now, here's a question for both students and parents to ponder: What, in your opinion, are the key factors that will help you succeed in your Earn While You Learn journey? We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Keep up the good work with your exams, and remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Together, we'll make this journey an incredible success.

*_Let's kick off our session with a fascinating scientific fact:_*

 The Eiffel Tower can actually be 15 cm taller during the summer. This happens because the iron expands in the heat and contracts in the winter, causing the height variation.🤯🗼
28/11/23, 8:27 am - +263 71 364 4123: Good morning Mrs Ananya

One has to identify companies for this project through asking family, friends and also educate other people on Edoofa. One has to also create a LinkedIn account and you'll be helping me in the process and the feedback should be given to you and after proper research about the companies I have to conduct a meeting in which fits in your schedule so that your team (Edoofa) and you can talk to them about the business aspects which will be created
28/11/23, 8:38 am - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing, Takundanashe. I’m happy with your understanding.

28/11/23, 9:21 am - Ananya Edoofa: Well, before we sign off, here's a quick one for you: Why don't scientists trust atoms?

Because they make up everything! 😄 Anyway, it was great chatting with you today. 

Let's catch up again tomorrow at the same time, 8:30 AM. Take care and see you soon!
28/11/23, 9:22 am - +263 71 364 4123: Thank you for the session
29/11/23, 8:26 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Takundanashe!

As we embark on our session, here's another intriguing fact about India: The country is not only known for its diverse cultures but also for being home to the *world's highest cricket ground*. At an altitude of 2,444 meters, the Chail Cricket Ground in Himachal Pradesh provides a breathtaking setting for the sport. 🏏🏞️ <This message was edited>
29/11/23, 8:29 am - +263 71 364 4123: Good morning Ms Ananya
29/11/23, 8:34 am - +263 71 364 4123: I'm ready for the session
29/11/23, 8:50 am - Ananya Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
29/11/23, 8:53 am - +263 71 364 4123: Well noted
29/11/23, 8:57 am - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
29/11/23, 8:59 am - +263 71 364 4123: Okay
29/11/23, 9:00 am - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
29/11/23, 9:00 am - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
29/11/23, 9:00 am - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
29/11/23, 9:00 am - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
29/11/23, 9:00 am - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
29/11/23, 9:00 am - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

29/11/23, 9:04 am - +263 71 364 4123: Well noted
29/11/23, 9:09 am - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
29/11/23, 9:09 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

29/11/23, 9:09 am - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
29/11/23, 9:09 am - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
29/11/23, 9:09 am - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
29/11/23, 9:09 am - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.

30/11/23, 9:16 am - +263 71 364 4123: The last project is the African schools education reform mission. It involves informing teachers and heads of the schools about qualifying in the EDOOFA program. One has to inform schools in his/her region about EDOOFA. Make a list or one can start with his school. And ask the heads to set an online meeting with Edoofa and give the details to my EWYL mentor and also to arrange a meeting of the head and Edoofa director so as to initiate a conversation
30/11/23, 9:18 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have- so, congratulations. However, I’d still like to ask- are there any questions you have about this project?

Did you know there's a big word, 'paraskavedekatriaphobia,' which means being afraid of Friday the 13th? Some folks get spooked on this day and avoid doing important stuff. 😵‍💫

But you know what's funny? Statistically, it's not more accident-prone than any other day. So, if someone tells you they're scared of Friday the 13th, you can just say it's all in their head!
07/12/23, 12:24 pm - +263 71 364 4123: Thank you for the knowledge
08/12/23, 8:29 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Takundanashe!

Due to some personal reasons, I won't be able to connect for our session today. However, I had a plan for our session, which I am stating now.

With years of experience, I want you to accumulate some credits before you come here to India. Students who have already earned some credits are living much better lives as they can help their parents with travel costs and even semester fees. I am sure you have also signed up for EWYL, so that you can do the same. As your mentor, I want to ensure that you utilize our services and earn for yourself. Now, have some faith in me and start working.

As a starting point, I have a small target for you for the day! Connect with at least *2 students* today under your community building project and submit the application forms to me by tomorrow. By tomorrow, you will either be successful with the two students or may face some challenges, on which we will work together!

All the best!
11/12/23, 8:29 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Takundanashe!

12/12/23, 9:19 am - Ananya Edoofa: May I know if you have the Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him/her for your School Head’s Contact.
12/12/23, 9:20 am - +263 71 364 4123: I don't have the number but I'll look for it
12/12/23, 9:20 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, once you find the contact, let me know so that I can help you with the kind of conversation you have to have with your school head.
12/12/23, 9:22 am - +263 71 364 4123: Well noted Ms Ananya
12/12/23, 9:30 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great session! As you wrap up, remember the exciting opportunities EWYL projects offer for earning credit. Your dedication is key to success. Dive into these projects, showcase your skills, and watch your efforts pay off academically.

Let's connect tomorrow at 8:30 am.
12/12/23, 9:34 am - +263 71 364 4123: Well noted
12/12/23, 9:34 am - +263 71 364 4123: Thank you for the session
13/12/23, 8:51 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Takundanashe!

Kindly excuse me for the slight delay; we were having a team discussion with the admissions team to understand the admissions status of our students. How are you doing today?
13/12/23, 8:56 am - +263 77 384 0518: It's OK Ms Ananya . A blessed  day to you
13/12/23, 8:58 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Takundanashe we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
14/12/23, 8:35 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Takundanashe!

Let us begin today's session with an interesting question: _If you were allowed to spend a day in the life of a fictional character from any book or movie, who would it be and what adventures would you embark on?_
15/12/23, 8:29 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Takundanashe!

I hope you are doing well, let us begin today's session with an amazing fact!

_Bananas are berries, but strawberries aren't. In botanical terms, a berry is a fleshy fruit produced from a single ovary, and bananas fit this definition perfectly. On the other hand, strawberries, despite their name, are not true berries. So, the next time you enjoy a banana, you can think of it as a true berry!_🍓🫐
15/12/23, 8:34 am - +263 71 364 4123: Good morning
15/12/23, 8:37 am - Ananya Edoofa: How are you doing, Takundanashe!
15/12/23, 9:34 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let's conclude our session today. Since we don't have sessions on Saturdays and Sundays, let's plan to reconnect on Monday.

Meanwhile, I'd like to give you a small target as a fresher: try connecting with 4-5 students under your community-building project and submit their application forms. As it's your first time, this will help you understand the process and potential challenges. Feel free to share any difficulties you encounter so that we can address them together when we reconvene on Monday.🌟
18/12/23, 8:32 am - Ananya Edoofa: 🎶 Welcome to the festive spirit of Christmas week, Takundanashe!

Did you know that Santa's reindeer are not just fast fliers; they also have some fun names! Can you name all eight of them? There's Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, and Blitzen. And of course, the most famous reindeer of all, Rudolph, with his shiny red nose! 🦌🎅✨
18/12/23, 8:47 am - +263 71 364 4123: Good morning
18/12/23, 8:50 am - Ananya Edoofa: How are you doing, how was your weekend, Takundanashe?
18/12/23, 9:21 am - +263 71 364 4123: It was very much okay and yours
18/12/23, 9:23 am - Ananya Edoofa: I hope you are aware that our session duration is only one hour. If you join in the latter half of that time, it will be challenging for us to complete our session in a fruitful manner. I trust you understand that attending sessions on time is crucial for earning credits.
18/12/23, 10:48 am - +263 71 364 4123: Yes I understand
18/12/23, 11:02 am - Ananya Edoofa: I've got some fantastic news for you, and I am genuinely thrilled!

Guess what? We've created a special group for students from your school, and our team has handpicked four outstanding students to be the leaders of this group as Edoofian representatives. And guess what again? You are one of those chosen students!

For this exciting role, we want you to share your personal journey in the group with Edoofa. From your counseling sessions to your EWYL experiences, we want to hear it all. Tell us about the positive changes you've noticed within yourself. Feel free to jot down your thoughts and share them with me so that I can help proofread it for you!

And here's the cherry on top: for every student from that group who enrolls in our program, you'll earn $5 per student! How awesome is that?
18/12/23, 12:11 pm - +263 71 364 4123: Well noted
18/12/23, 12:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, for this, I want to you share your experience through a message, and in order to proceed today, I want you to frame a message right now, so that I can proofread that.
18/12/23, 12:20 pm - +263 71 364 4123: Now I'm a bit tied up but I'll as soon as possible
18/12/23, 12:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Takundanashe, other students have already submitted their introductions. I don't think it would take a lot of time.

So, I would suggest you work on it right now, as I would also need some time to proofread it.
18/12/23, 4:08 pm - +263 71 364 4123: Edoofa is a very nice institution. It helps people to persue their education and to gain affordable learning fees.

19/12/23, 8:30 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Takundanashe!

I've read your message, and it's nice. However, imagine you are someone wishing to apply for foreign education, and you have asked for consultancy from a person. Would you be satisfied if that person said this to you?
19/12/23, 9:20 am - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Takundanashe, I was hoping to have a fruitful session today with some new targets. However, you did not attend the session. May I ask if you are facing any challenges?

20/12/23, 8:31 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Takundanashe! 🎄

To kick off our session with a festive spirit, how about starting with a Christmas-themed icebreaker? I invite you to share something related to the holiday season that holds special meaning for you. It could be a favorite ornament, a cherished holiday recipe, or even a funny holiday-themed anecdote. ✨🧑🏽‍🎄🎄 <This message was edited>
20/12/23, 11:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I was expecting a response from your end during our session time; however, now that our session time is over, we shall connect tomorrow at the same time. I really hope that you will connect with me tomorrow at the same time.

There are loving n caring staff of Edoofa who will take you through the enrolment  process until you get admission  at one of the Indian Universities .My experience with Edoofa has been the best the mentors guide you in the enrollment process.

They helped me in choosing a program which was right for me. The mentorship is very fun and friendly. I encourage you all to join the enrolment  process you meet well trained staff  who will take you through. Be a proud  Edoofian
