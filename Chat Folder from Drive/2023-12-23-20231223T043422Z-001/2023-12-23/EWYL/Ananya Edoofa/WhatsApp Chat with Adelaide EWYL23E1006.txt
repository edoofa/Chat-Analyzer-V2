13/12/23, 12:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Wonderful, my student! So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
13/12/23, 12:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 12:55 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Sure
13/12/23, 12:58 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Here's to the beginning of a beautiful journey together 🥂. I'm sure I'll enjoy the experience
13/12/23, 12:59 pm - +263 77 218 8531: Thanks for the introduction. Looking forward to a fruitful working relationship
13/12/23, 1:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?
13/12/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 653 1903: So... I'm Adelaide Takura Sithole, and I'm an aspiring chemical engineer. I'm all about breaking stereotypes and have chosen to break the bias by joining a male dominated field. I'm an avid reader, writer and researcher. I am a passionate speaker and yeah....
13/12/23, 4:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Adelaide! 🌟 
That's awesome – breaking stereotypes and diving into a male-dominated field takes serious guts. Big respect! 🚀 Chemical engineering sounds fascinating. <This message was edited>
13/12/23, 4:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I am very excited to begin our EWYL Hourney together. So let us connect on Friday!🌟🤝🏽
13/12/23, 4:22 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Alright.  I'll be here
15/12/23, 1:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Adelaide!

I hope you are doing well, let us begin today's session with an amazing fact!
Bananas are berries, but strawberries aren't. In botanical terms, a berry is a fleshy fruit produced from a single ovary, and bananas fit this definition perfectly. On the other hand, strawberries, despite their name, are not true berries. So, the next time you enjoy a banana, you can think of it as a true berry!🍓🫐
15/12/23, 1:43 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Good afternoon miss. I am genuinely surprised by the fact
15/12/23, 1:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
15/12/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 653 1903: No I do not
15/12/23, 1:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
15/12/23, 1:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
15/12/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Ok. Noted ma'am
15/12/23, 1:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
15/12/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Noted ma'am
15/12/23, 2:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
15/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Very interesting
15/12/23, 2:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
15/12/23, 2:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Its pretty interesting
15/12/23, 2:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
15/12/23, 2:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let's conclude our session today. Since we don't have sessions on Saturdays and Sundays, let's plan to reconnect on Monday!🌟
15/12/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 653 1903: The Quotes
15/12/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Alright. Have a blessed weekend
18/12/23, 1:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: 🎶 Welcome to the festive spirit of Christmas week, Adelaide

Did you know that Santa's reindeer are not just fast fliers; they also have some fun names! Can you name all eight of them? There's Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, and Blitzen. And of course, the most famous reindeer of all, Rudolph, with his shiny red nose! 🦌🎅✨
18/12/23, 1:37 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Thank you very much
18/12/23, 1:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
18/12/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Sounds interesting
18/12/23, 1:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
18/12/23, 1:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 2:01 pm - +263 78 653 1903: I have gone through the document ma'am
18/12/23, 2:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
18/12/23, 2:04 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Sure
18/12/23, 2:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: By the way, I was having a conversation with the admissions team, and I came to know that you are about to receive an offer letter from the university! How are you feeling? Are you excited?
18/12/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Nervous

18/12/23, 2:33 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Sorry miss, I am still not answered. I do understand I'll get help with choosing the best offer, but how many offers should I expect in the first place
18/12/23, 3:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Excuse me, Adelaide, that I missed your message. The number of offer letters is based on the number of applications that have been submitted to the university and which one of them has accepted your application.

If you wish to understand how your application is being processed or evaluated by the university, I would suggest you connect with the admissions team, as they are the best people to guide you through this.
18/12/23, 3:41 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Alright ma'am thank you
18/12/23, 3:43 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Also, while I was connecting with the admissions team today, they mentioned that there was a scheduled discussion with you on Friday, but you did not attend. Can I know if there is something that is bothering you?
18/12/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 218 8531: Good afternoon Ms Ananya.

While I might not always be an active participant in all the discussions, I am closely monitoring the progress of this program and I have taken it upon myself to ensure that Adelaide is available for all the scheduled sessions. I seem to have missed where it was mentioned that there was a scheduled session with the admissions team. The appointment i had diarised for Friday was with you. My apologies if indeed we missed a scheduled session. We were just unaware of the said appointment. We currently have no issues that may hinder our participation in this journey.
18/12/23, 4:02 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Apologies. I  was unaware that I had a session with the admissions team on Friday. I assumed the only session was with you
19/12/23, 7:56 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, @263786531903 @263772188531 

That is completely alright, I was just concerned if you are facing any challenges!

19/12/23, 1:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good day, Adelaide! 🎄☀️

Did you know that the tradition of hanging stockings by the fireplace comes from the legend of St. Nicholas? According to the story, St. Nicholas dropped gold coins down the chimney of a poor man's house, and they landed in the stockings that were hanging by the fire to dry. From then on, the tradition stuck, and now many of us hang stockings as part of our Christmas celebrations. 🧦✨
Now that we've kicked off with a festive fun fact, how can I assist you in today's session? 😊🎁
19/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Good afternoon ma'am. Yesterday you said to share my understanding of the 3 projects in the document and I did. May I please get feedback on my responses and advice on a way forward

19/12/23, 1:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

19/12/23, 6:58 pm - +263 78 653 1903: I am to identify local companies and reach out to the decision makers via LinkedIn or email in them to create an alliance with Edoofa
20/12/23, 1:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Adelaide! 🎄

To kick off our session with a festive spirit, how about starting with a Christmas-themed icebreaker? I invite you to share something related to the holiday season that holds special meaning for you. It could be a favorite ornament, a cherished holiday recipe, or even a funny holiday-themed anecdote. ✨🧑🏽‍🎄🎄
20/12/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 653 1903: A common tradition here in Zimbabwe is that every child gets to wear new clothes on Christmas day. In some it's the only time they ever do. Even at this age, I've come to look forward to wearing new clothes on the 25th
20/12/23, 1:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know, we also do the same thing on Diwali, Adelaide!🤝🏽
20/12/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 653 1903: What's Diwali?
20/12/23, 2:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Diwali, the Festival of Lights, celebrates the victory of good over evil. Occurring in October or November, it involves illuminating homes with lights and oil lamps, sharing meals, exchanging gifts, and enjoying fireworks. While rooted in Hindu traditions, it is widely observed by various communities, fostering joy, reflection, and strengthened relationships.
20/12/23, 2:12 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Sounds fun

20/12/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 653 1903: This is a step by step process on how to search for appropriate companies.

I am to search about tye company, read about it, study their website, check out its social pages then read about the backgrounds of the founders and core members
20/12/23, 2:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know what Adelaide, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.

21/12/23, 1:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Adelaide!

Let us begin our session with a thought! Have you ever wondered why Santa doesn't get a parking ticket on Christmas Eve? It turns out he has 'Sleigh Parking Only' privileges and his reindeer are excellent at navigating the skies without worrying about traffic laws. It seems Santa's got connections in high places – or should I say, the North Pole!" 🎅✨
21/12/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Good afternoon ma'am

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
22/12/23, 2:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
22/12/23, 2:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
22/12/23, 2:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
22/12/23, 2:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

22/12/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Ok ma'am
22/12/23, 2:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
22/12/23, 2:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
