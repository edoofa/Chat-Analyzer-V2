01/12/23, 4:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

01/12/23, 4:54 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Okay looking forward to it
04/12/23, 1:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Dalitso!

Let's start our session with an interesting tidbit about India. Did you know that the concept of 'zero' (0) as a mathematical digit was invented by Indian mathematician Aryabhata?

It's a remarkable contribution that has had a profound impact on mathematics and science globally. 🤯
04/12/23, 2:00 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Good afternoon. 

I never knew about that. That’s true it has a major contribution not only in math but in computer programming as well
04/12/23, 2:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Dalitso, may I ask why are you late today?
04/12/23, 2:13 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: I was escorting my friend to the hospital. He hasn’t been feeling well since morning
04/12/23, 2:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: What happened, Dalitso? Is he alright?
04/12/23, 2:20 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: He got medication and the doctor said he will be fine after 4 days, he has had a high fever since he woke up and he said he felt weak and had nausea. He was found with malaria.
04/12/23, 2:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I understand, and it's good to know how caring you are for your friends.
04/12/23, 2:28 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: It’s the least I can do since they look out for me as well when I’m going through tough times
04/12/23, 2:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I understand, Before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?
04/12/23, 2:42 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Of course, the things I enjoy the most are having quality time with my friends, going for walks to admire nature, sometimes I enjoy watching the stars at night. During my spare time alone I watch some documentaries and movies or read some articles. 

My primary goal is to achieve the highest degree I can possibly reach. My secondary goals include completing my bachelor’s degree with a distinction, learning two or three skills that are valued on the market and if all goes well realize my dream to travel around the world

My passions… that’s a bit tricky but if I were to select one I am really interested in then it would be art
04/12/23, 2:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: That's awesome! Your mix of interests is so diverse. Quality time with friends and nature walks sound so refreshing. Watching the stars is just magical, isn't it? 🌌 And your goals are ambitious – highest degree, distinction in bachelor's, skills, and world travel? That's the way to go!  

Also, art is fantastic. What kind of art are you drawn to? Painting, music, or something else? 🎨🎶 <This message was edited>
04/12/23, 2:51 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Thank you very much. 

I really like music poetry and drama. It’s mesmerizing how people can express so much emotion with a small amount of words and still be able to move the hearts of many people leaving different impacts on them. That’s where I see the beauty in art, everyone sees art differently and they translate it in the way they can relate to it and that is unique to everyone.
04/12/23, 4:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now, as we close today's session, let me leave you with a thought: 'The only way to do great work is to love what you do.' - Steve Jobs. Let this inspire us for tomorrow. Until then, take care, and let us connect tomorrow.🧠🏆
04/12/23, 4:23 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Will be looking forward to tomorrow as well
05/12/23, 1:37 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Good day 
Am ready if you are .
05/12/23, 1:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Dalitso

Here's a fun and easy fact to brighten your day: Honeybees can recognize human faces! These tiny creatures have an amazing ability to remember and distinguish between different human faces. So, the next time you see a bee buzzing around, maybe it's just saying, "Hello!"🐝
05/12/23, 1:40 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: That’s something amazing
05/12/23, 1:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
05/12/23, 1:44 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Please explain them to me.
05/12/23, 1:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
05/12/23, 1:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
05/12/23, 1:57 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: That’s very much understandable
05/12/23, 1:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
05/12/23, 2:01 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: That’s very interesting
05/12/23, 2:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
05/12/23, 2:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 2:12 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: I have finished and thank u for sharing
05/12/23, 2:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
05/12/23, 2:20 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: On the EDOOFA HALL OF INSPIRATION it states that “ Time is an
important factor and it has to be managed well.” And “ As the road gets tougher you also get tougher “ 

I feel like these are life keys that one needs to live by
05/12/23, 2:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Dalitso?
05/12/23, 2:26 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: That sounds great 👍
05/12/23, 2:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
05/12/23, 2:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 2:27 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Yeah it’s clear
05/12/23, 2:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, let us conclude our session for today! Meanwhile, check out our new post on our Instagram page!

05/12/23, 2:37 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: That’s really a nice post 🔥
05/12/23, 3:15 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: I have gone through the PDF
06/12/23, 1:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Dalitso!

Let us begin today's session with a quick riddle: 'I have keys but no locks. I have space but no room. You can enter, but you can't go inside. What am I?'

Try to answer!😄
06/12/23, 1:37 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Good afternoon,, 

Am thinking of a keyboard, did I get that right?
06/12/23, 1:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, you are right!🚀✨
06/12/23, 1:42 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Am Glad 🥳
06/12/23, 1:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, Dalitso did you manage to read the document?
06/12/23, 1:51 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Yes I did, although I need a brief explanation on its details for a wider understanding
06/12/23, 1:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Don't worry  I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
06/12/23, 1:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 1:59 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Am done
06/12/23, 2:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
06/12/23, 2:11 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: The first project aims to make me understand the market am going to work in after graduation there as starting work on it at an early stage.

Due to the pandemic most companies have improved to online technology and the use of LinkedIn helps to connect with different managers of different companies
06/12/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing, Dalitso. I’m happy with your understanding. 

So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
06/12/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 2:27 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: It’s a guideline for how to search for the right companies and things to consider when doing so such as nature of the company and scale of the company as two of the examples mentioned 

And examples of platforms used in older to reach out to different companies and the steps to help one do so
06/12/23, 2:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, let us conclude our today's session here, and I can't wait to connect with you in our next session tomorrow!

Meanwhile, check out this incredible post on our page, and don't miss the comment section! 🥳

08/12/23, 8:32 am - +265 992 60 60 54: Okay thank you for the heads up
11/12/23, 1:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Daltiso!

Before diving into today's session, I want to share a few highlights with you from the recent webinar that took place for our students here in India!🌟

https://www.instagram.com/p/C0jSIPrvg_1/
11/12/23, 1:38 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Good afternoon
11/12/23, 1:40 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Thank you for sharing
11/12/23, 1:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –
1 –  You can use the following form to share the company details with me
*Company Details for Project 1*

Name of the company:
Website:
Name of the Contact Person:
Designation:
Linkedin ID/Whatsapp Phone Number:
Description of the company:
How did you get in touch with the contact person?
11/12/23, 1:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: 2, and the fun part- I’m sure you read about Scholarship Credits in the document- so, here’s the opportunity for you to earn Scholarship Credits through Project 1 –

1. If you can set up a Company Call with Edoofa Managers : *$2 per call*
2. If the Company signs an MOU with Edoofa : *$20*

11/12/23, 1:52 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: That’s very much clear .
11/12/23, 2:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Dalitso, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Dalitso!
11/12/23, 2:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 2:08 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Am done and well understood.
11/12/23, 2:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
11/12/23, 2:17 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: The next project is the community development project in which involves approaching your those around you such as friends who are interested in studying abroad and have just written their exams and finished their high school. 

After explaining the program to them and having a discussion with their parents and are serious about it they will have to fill the offline form in which it will be shared on the group and due to many applications received the limit a student can send is 10
11/12/23, 2:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: That’s awesome, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.
11/12/23, 2:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: 1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

Subject Combination in A Level:-
Current Class (L5 / L6 / U6):

I will be appearing for my Advance Level Examination in (Year):-

Preferred year of Admission:- 
August 2024 or August 2025
11/12/23, 2:20 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Thank you for sharing
11/12/23, 2:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
11/12/23, 2:25 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Okay I understand that
11/12/23, 2:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
11/12/23, 2:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
11/12/23, 2:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
11/12/23, 2:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
11/12/23, 2:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
11/12/23, 2:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
11/12/23, 2:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

Did you know octopuses have three hearts and blue blood? Two pumps to the gills, and one to the body. They're basically the rockstars of the ocean with a unique sense of style! Now, let's dive into our session with that octopus energy!🐙
12/12/23, 1:31 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Good afternoon
12/12/23, 1:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
12/12/23, 1:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
13/12/23, 2:00 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: 1. Blantyre Baptist Academy , no it is not connected with Edoofa 

2. Good Day am Dalitso Kamtimaleka and I would like to share with you the scholarship opportunity I came across known as the Edoofa scholarship program.Edoofa is an amazing scholarship program that offers opportunities for students to study in India. They provide scholarships for various fields of study and support students throughout their academic journey. 

3. Blantyre, Nancholi
13/12/23, 2:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, as per our records, your school is not connected with us.  I would like you to connect with your School Head. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all your schoolmates.
13/12/23, 2:10 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: I have to connect with them now ?
13/12/23, 4:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, kindly excuse me for not being able to move forward with our discussion. I have been facing some technical challenges today!

However, don't worry; everything will be resolved by tomorrow, and we will move ahead. See you tomorrow! 🌟
13/12/23, 4:27 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Okay no problem
14/12/23, 1:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Dalitso!

Let us begin today's session with an interesting question: If you were allowed to spend a day in the life of a fictional character from any book or movie, who would it be and what adventures would you embark on?
14/12/23, 3:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I was expecting a response from your end, may I know if you are facing any challenges?
14/12/23, 3:56 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Am sorry I was caught up in something am really sorry for the late response
14/12/23, 4:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I hope from now onwards you will be punctual with the sessions, as this is going to have a direct impact on your performance.
14/12/23, 4:38 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Okay I will do
15/12/23, 1:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Dalitso!

I hope you are doing well, let us begin today's session with an amazing fact!
Bananas are berries, but strawberries aren't. In botanical terms, a berry is a fleshy fruit produced from a single ovary, and bananas fit this definition perfectly. On the other hand, strawberries, despite their name, are not true berries. So, the next time you enjoy a banana, you can think of it as a true berry!🍓🫐
15/12/23, 1:34 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Good afternoon
15/12/23, 1:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, Dalitso may I ask if you were able to find the contact number of your school head?
15/12/23, 1:41 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Yes , I have the contact number
15/12/23, 1:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
15/12/23, 1:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
15/12/23, 1:43 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: That’s very much understood
15/12/23, 1:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_

Greetings Mr./Mrs *School Head Name*!
Hope you are doing well.

I am *Your Name* and I am a beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
I stand obliged to get an opportunity to connect with you, I hope to have a result/conclusion-driven conversation with you today.

May I know at what time you will be available to connect via Whatsapp?
15/12/23, 1:49 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: I have taken note of that
15/12/23, 1:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now,Dalitso we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
15/12/23, 1:57 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Everything as been clearly explained as to now so I do not have any concerns at the moment
15/12/23, 2:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
15/12/23, 2:06 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Will try my very best to follow these 3 steps
15/12/23, 2:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Tuesday  and Friday-  12:00 pm to 1:30 pm
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
15/12/23, 2:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
15/12/23, 2:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
15/12/23, 2:15 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Done 👍
15/12/23, 2:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let's conclude our session today. Since we don't have sessions on Saturdays and Sundays, let's plan to reconnect on tuesday

Meanwhile, I'd like to give you a small target as a fresher: try connecting with 4-5 students under your community-building project and submit their application forms. As it's your first time, this will help you understand the process and potential challenges. Feel free to share any difficulties you encounter so that we can address them together when we reconvene on Tuesday.🌟
15/12/23, 2:21 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Okay will gladly do so
19/12/23, 12:42 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: I did as instructed on the EWYL line but am not getting any feedback as we were supposed to start at 12 pm
22/12/23, 12:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Dalitso!

I hope you're well. I wanted to discuss the timing of our sessions. If you can't make it on time, I might have to skip the session, as it's challenging for me to remind you each time. Tekk me, do your teachers send reminders before classes?
22/12/23, 12:17 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: There was a network problem sorry . 
It’s okay now
22/12/23, 2:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa added Akshit EWYL
