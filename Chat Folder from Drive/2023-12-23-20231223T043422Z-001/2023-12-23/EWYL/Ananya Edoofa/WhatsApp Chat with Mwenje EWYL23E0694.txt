Our names are Dennis Milanzi and Ms Peggy Mutale Milanzi. We are the parents of Mwenje Milanzi. Our daughter's EWYL Group name is Mwenje EWYL23E0694.
We are reaching out on her behalf as she is in school to express our excitement with her EWYL journey.
We are available for 27/09/2023.
Schedule our session.
27/09/23, 8:02 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Parents! 

I am thrilled to introduce myself as Ms. Ananya, Mwenje's mentor for the EWYL program. Together, we will work hard and aim for the sky to earn maximum scholarship credits from this program.

So, are you ready to join me on this exciting journey? Let's work hard and reach for the stars!🌟

Monday to Friday, 8:30 AM to 9:30AM
                              OR

Our preferred time is Monday to Friday between 2pm to 3pm

27/09/23, 8:43 am - Ananya Edoofa: Meanwhile, , to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
27/09/23, 8:43 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/09/23, 2:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!

How are you today? Are you ready ?✨
27/09/23, 2:04 pm - +260 97 7798912: We are alright and how is it going with you
27/09/23, 2:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now,  I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
27/09/23, 2:11 pm - +260 97 7798912: *Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL* Program is an innovation of Edoofa that builds the capacity of students while at the same time exposing students to projects where they earn points. The students gain excellent work experience and also access an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that are equal to physical cash. These credits can be used to pay off a reasonable portion or part of their higher education fees there by making their university education more affordable.
27/09/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
27/09/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
27/09/23, 2:14 pm - +260 97 7798912: Noted
27/09/23, 3:17 pm - +260 97 7798912: Yes I have gone through the newsletter
28/09/23, 2:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!

How are you today? Are you ready for your session?🏆
28/09/23, 2:03 pm - +260 97 7798912: Good afternoon @918800325457
28/09/23, 2:03 pm - +260 97 7693061: Greetings too and good afternoon
28/09/23, 2:03 pm - +260 97 7798912: We are alright and how about you
28/09/23, 2:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I am good, @917428445625 @260977693061
28/09/23, 2:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for *Mwenje*’S EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure *Mwenje* is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
28/09/23, 2:13 pm - +260 97 7798912: @918800325457 
Thank you for the direction. This is helpful to us.
28/09/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that *Mwenje* will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
29/09/23, 2:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, 

How are you? Are you ready for your session?🏆
29/09/23, 2:17 pm - +260 97 7798912: @918800325457 
How are you doing?
29/09/23, 2:17 pm - +260 97 7798912: We are ready
29/09/23, 2:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/09/23, 2:19 pm - +260 97 7798912: Thank you for the document. Is it the one we were supposed to receive yesterday?
29/09/23, 2:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Yes @260977798912
29/09/23, 2:21 pm - +260 97 7798912: Thank you for this
29/09/23, 2:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how *Mwenje* can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things *Mwenje* is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make mentor trust the student fully
29/09/23, 2:33 pm - +260 97 7798912: This is helpful indeed
29/09/23, 2:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Tuesday and Friday - 12:00 pm  to 1:30 pm
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
29/09/23, 2:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
29/09/23, 2:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
29/09/23, 2:41 pm - +260 97 7798912: Does it mean we will move away from this WhatsApp group and begin to engage direct to the EWYL Program line only?
29/09/23, 2:43 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, this is the end of the initial sessions. When Mwenje comes back, we will connect through this EWYL Line. Is that alright?
29/09/23, 2:45 pm - +260 97 7798912: Yes it's understood
29/09/23, 2:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: In order to do that you need to draft a mail to Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because _ from _ to _ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Ananya as soon as I get over with my school.

Send it to - sanjana.edoofa@gmail.com, and ananyaa.edoofa@gmail.com and ewyl@edoofa.com


Once done, please let me know.

I know you're all deep into your studies, and that's fantastic! 📚 But I wanted to share an incredible video with you that I believe can help alleviate some of the exam stress. 🌟

Watch the Video Here : *https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnpQrMqDoqE&pp=ygU1aGVscGZ1bCB2aWRlbyBmb3IgZXhhbSBzdHJlc3MgZm9yIHN0dWRlbnRzIGluIGVuZ2xpc2g%3D*

Wishing you all the best of luck with your exams! Stay focused and keep shining. ✨
30/10/23, 4:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, @260977693061 @260977798912 

I understand that you're currently dealing with exams, but I've shared a video with you to support your studies. As your mentor, I'm genuinely concerned about your progress and want to see you succeed in your examinations.

I must admit that I'm quite disappointed that there hasn't been a response from you. Communication is essential for us to work together effectively. If you have any concerns or questions, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Let's ensure we're on the same page and working toward your success.
30/10/23, 5:36 pm - +260 97 7693061: Thank you so much. The video was timely
30/10/23, 5:36 pm - +260 97 7693061: And helpful at the same time
31/10/23, 4:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I really hope that these insights will be fruitful for your future endeavors.
31/10/23, 6:16 pm - +260 97 7693061: Surely, they will
31/10/23, 7:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa is an organization that fosters careers and empowers students to progress in a more positive direction, achieving the right balance of exposure and opportunities, alongside education, is essential for a student's overall growth.

With this principle in mind, I am thrilled to share how our students are balancing correctly between exposure and experience with their academics:

⭕A group of our students recently participated in a football tournament, and we are immensely proud to announce that they reached the competition's semifinals.

⭕Another group of students participated in a debate competition, and I am delighted to add that two of our students emerged as winners.

⭕Furthermore, our students regularly come together for interactive sessions with their fellow Edoofians, building stronger relationships and providing mutual support.
31/10/23, 7:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: ◾ Being your mentor, as you prepare to join us in India, I would like to know: What kind of skills or exposure would you want to be a part of during your time here?

Hope you are doing well.

Our Edoofians in India lit up Diwali, the Festival of Lights, with unmatched enthusiasm. From radiant diyas to vibrant rangoli, their classrooms and homes sparkled with festive joy🪔. Embracing cultural diversity, students and teachers adorned themselves in traditional attire, fostering a sense of unity. The spirit of giving shone through charity initiatives, and the night sky dazzled with spectacular fireworks💥. This Diwali celebration wasn't just a festival; it was a vibrant tapestry of tradition, unity, and joy, creating unforgettable memories for our Edoofian family! Have a look at it👇🏼

23/11/23, 9:02 am - +260 779747930: What I understand is that I have to meet the needs of EDOOFA and to do that I must spread the word about the program. It also talks about the skills I must have to communicate well with people,how I must reach out to companies that I'm supposed to work with. It also talks about the processes I must go through before enrollment.
23/11/23, 9:04 am - +260 779747930: I must also spread the word about Indian schools to the schools in my region. It also says what type of behavior I must portray as an EDOOFIAN student.
23/11/23, 9:06 am - +260 779747930: And also how to fill in my application.
23/11/23, 9:21 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great! I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!

24/11/23, 8:37 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Mwenje!

Let us begin our session with a *FUN FACT*: Did you know that the Basenji dog breed is known as the "barkless dog" because it doesn't bark like other dogs? Instead, it makes a unique yodel-like sound known as a "barroo," due to the shape of its larynx.
24/11/23, 8:38 am - +260 779747930: No I did not know that
24/11/23, 8:44 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Mwenje!

24/11/23, 9:27 am - Ananya Edoofa: Well, let us conclude our session here and get ready for more enthusiasm on Monday at 8:30 am. We do not have sessions over the weekend, so recharge and come back ready to rock!

Happy Weekend! 🚀
24/11/23, 9:28 am - +260 779747930: Thanks for today. Looking forward to the next session 😁
27/11/23, 8:47 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Mwenje!

Did you know that India and Africa share a rich history of diplomatic and trade relations that dates back centuries? The strong bond between these two regions has been further strengthened in recent years through collaborative efforts in various sectors, including trade, infrastructure, and technology.

Let us cherish this amazing bond, and start our session !
27/11/23, 8:50 am - +260 779747930: Good morning 🌅
27/11/23, 8:51 am - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
27/11/23, 8:52 am - +260 779747930: I'm ready
27/11/23, 8:52 am - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
27/11/23, 8:52 am - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
27/11/23, 8:52 am - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
27/11/23, 8:52 am - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
27/11/23, 8:52 am - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
27/11/23, 8:52 am - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

27/11/23, 8:52 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 8:57 am - +260 779747930: Okay
27/11/23, 8:57 am - +260 779747930: What next?
27/11/23, 9:02 am - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
27/11/23, 9:02 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
27/11/23, 9:02 am - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
27/11/23, 9:02 am - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
27/11/23, 9:02 am - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below.

27/11/23, 9:13 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have- so, congratulations. However, I’d still like to ask- are there any questions you have about this project?

28/11/23, 8:27 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Mwenje!

*_Let's kick off our session with a fascinating scientific fact:_*

 The Eiffel Tower can actually be 15 cm taller during the summer. This happens because the iron expands in the heat and contracts in the winter, causing the height variation.🤯🗼
28/11/23, 8:30 am - +260 779747930: Good morning Ananya
28/11/23, 8:33 am - Ananya Edoofa: Well, as per our records, your school is not connected with us. And Voila! You can therefore connect with your own school and earn credits at an initial stage!
28/11/23, 8:34 am - +260 779747930: What if I don't have their contact info
28/11/23, 8:34 am - +260 779747930: They are the ones that introduced me to this program
28/11/23, 8:35 am - +260 779747930: Maybe you're familiar with Mr Mwanza
28/11/23, 8:37 am - Ananya Edoofa: I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him/her for your School Head’s Contact. <This message was edited>
28/11/23, 8:38 am - +260 779747930: Okay should I do it now or later
28/11/23, 8:44 am - Ananya Edoofa: You can do it later.
28/11/23, 8:44 am - +260 779747930: Okay so what's for today
28/11/23, 9:22 am - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to continue with our discussion, something urgent came up.
28/11/23, 9:23 am - Ananya Edoofa: Mwenje, since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
28/11/23, 9:24 am - +260 779747930: Okay
28/11/23, 9:32 am - +260 779747930: I need help with the projects
28/11/23, 9:33 am - Ananya Edoofa: Sure, Mwenje! We will from now work and talk on an dedicated line.
28/11/23, 9:35 am - +260 779747930: Okay
29/11/23, 8:20 am - +260 779747930: Good morning Ananya
29/11/23, 8:27 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Mwenje!

As we embark on our session, here's another intriguing fact about India: The country is not only known for its diverse cultures but also for being home to the *world's highest cricket ground*. At an altitude of 2,444 meters, the Chail Cricket Ground in Himachal Pradesh provides a breathtaking setting for the sport. 🏏🏞️
29/11/23, 8:29 am - +260 779747930: That's intriguing

29/11/23, 8:45 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now that you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
29/11/23, 8:45 am - Ananya Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
29/11/23, 8:47 am - +260 779747930: Okay we can start
29/11/23, 8:56 am - Ananya Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_

05/12/23, 12:22 pm - +260 97 7693061: Good morning
