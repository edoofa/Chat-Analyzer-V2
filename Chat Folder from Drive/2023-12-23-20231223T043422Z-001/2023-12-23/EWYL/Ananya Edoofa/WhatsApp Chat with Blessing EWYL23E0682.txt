22/09/23, 2:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!

Are you ready for your session?✨
22/09/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Good afternoon. We can proceed.
22/09/23, 2:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
22/09/23, 2:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/09/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Thank you very much Ananya for such an inspiring introduction.
22/09/23, 2:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You are most welcome, Sir!
22/09/23, 2:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
22/09/23, 2:17 pm - +263 77 493 1133: You may help by explaining them to me.
22/09/23, 2:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Sure! So the  the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *NAME* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.
22/09/23, 2:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
22/09/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Noted, thank you
22/09/23, 2:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke, one of our students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
22/09/23, 2:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/09/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Done
22/09/23, 2:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
22/09/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Thank you.
22/09/23, 2:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates *Blessing* to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either *Monday/Thursday* or *Tuesday/Friday*. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
22/09/23, 2:41 pm - +263 77 493 1133: It really sounds interesting, but we will not be able to have Blessing connecting to the program as of now until 17 November 2023. She is currently at school as I highlighted in my introduction where she has not access to WhatsApp due to strict school regulations. So if its ok with you, we may reschedule all the sessions directed to her up to the 17th of November. Any inconveniences caused are sincerely regretted.
22/09/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I understand, we can have  Blessing with us after November 17th! These are the basic details that are important for us to share with the student or the parent.
22/09/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Thank you very much for your cooperation. Anywhere, if there are any sessions direc
22/09/23, 2:46 pm - +263 77 493 1133: If there are any sessions for the parent, we can connect and proceed as per schedule.
22/09/23, 2:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once *Blessing* forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
22/09/23, 2:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/09/23, 2:54 pm - +263 77 493 1133: I am done.
22/09/23, 2:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for *Blessing*’S EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure *Blessing* is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
22/09/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 493 1133: That's great. You will have our support in ensuring that you achieve these three goals for our daughter. Thank you.
22/09/23, 3:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You are most welcome!
22/09/23, 3:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Blessing will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
22/09/23, 3:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/09/23, 3:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let us conclude our conversation here, we shall connect on Monday at the same time as we do not have our sessions on Saturday and Sunday! <This message was edited>
22/09/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Noted, enjoy your weekend.
22/09/23, 3:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Same to you, @263774931133

25/09/23, 2:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!

How are you today? Are you ready ?✨
25/09/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Good day, how are you. Yes we can begin our session.
25/09/23, 2:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing, may I ask if you were able to read this document?
25/09/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Yes and I am still going through it.
25/09/23, 2:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how *Blessing* can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things *Blessing* is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc., and make the mentor trust the student fully
25/09/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Noted
25/09/23, 2:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Tuesday and Friday - 9:30 am  to 11:00 am
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
25/09/23, 2:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
25/09/23, 2:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
25/09/23, 2:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: This is the platform where Blessing will connect with me once she is available. So kindly share the message on the Line so that I can keep track of it and can easily connect with her during an appropriate time.
28/09/23, 10:18 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, @263774931133 

How are you doing? Can I know the estimated date by which Blessing can connect with me?
28/09/23, 12:29 pm - +263 77 493 1133: Good morning Ananya. Blessing should be back home on the 18th of November 2023.
28/09/23, 12:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Thank you for the information, @263774931133
28/09/23, 12:29 pm - +263 77 493 1133: You are welcome.
19/10/23, 8:42 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

I know you're all deep into your studies, and that's fantastic! 📚 But I wanted to share an incredible video with you that I believe can help alleviate some of the exam stress. 🌟

Watch the Video Here : *https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnpQrMqDoqE&pp=ygU1aGVscGZ1bCB2aWRlbyBmb3IgZXhhbSBzdHJlc3MgZm9yIHN0dWRlbnRzIGluIGVuZ2xpc2g%3D*

I understand that you're currently dealing with exams, but I've shared a video with you to support your studies. As your mentor, I'm genuinely concerned about your progress and want to see you succeed in your examinations.

I must admit that I'm quite disappointed that there hasn't been a response from you. Communication is essential for us to work together effectively. If you have any concerns or questions, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Let's ensure we're on the same page and working toward your success.

Sorry for the inconveniences caused.
31/10/23, 7:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa is an organization that fosters careers and empowers students to progress in a more positive direction, achieving the right balance of exposure and opportunities, alongside education, is essential for a student's overall growth.

With this principle in mind, I am thrilled to share how our students are balancing correctly between exposure and experience with their academics:

⭕A group of our students recently participated in a football tournament, and we are immensely proud to announce that they reached the competition's semifinals.

⭕Another group of students participated in a debate competition, and I am delighted to add that two of our students emerged as winners.

⭕Furthermore, our students regularly come together for interactive sessions with their fellow Edoofians, building stronger relationships and providing mutual support.
31/10/23, 7:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: ◾ Being your mentor, as your child prepares to join us in India, I would like to know: What kind of skills or exposure would you want to be a part of during your time here?

07/11/23, 6:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Greetings, Blessing and parents,*

I hope this message finds you well amidst the ongoing examinations. I'm excited to share some fantastic news with you regarding the recent orientation held at Edoofa's partner colleges.

In these orientation programs, the primary aim was to bridge the gap between students and mentors. It provided the valuable opportunity for each student to meet their respective mentor, a crucial connection that will guide them throughout their EWYL and overall Edoofa's journey.

The session delved deep into the Earn While You Learn program, a path to financial independence while pursuing your education. We discussed strategies to maximize scholarship credits, ensuring our students make the most of this opportunity.

07/11/23, 6:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/11/23, 6:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: But it wasn't all about it. We also had a fun chit-chat session, breaking the ice and building a sense of community.

Now, here's a question for both students and parents to ponder: What, in your opinion, are the key factors that will help you succeed in your Earn While You Learn journey? We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Keep up the good work with your exams, and remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Together, we'll make this journey an incredible success.
07/11/23, 7:38 pm - +263 71 679 6852: The key factors include strategic focus,a well focused student is most likely to be able to achieve their goals.Also courage can be helpful, as a student will be willing to take risks to complete their tasks.
17/11/23, 4:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, Blessing!
Hope you are doing well.

Our Edoofians in India lit up Diwali, the Festival of Lights, with unmatched enthusiasm. From radiant diyas to vibrant rangoli, their classrooms and homes sparkled with festive joy🪔.

Let us begin our session with a *FUN FACT*: 

Did you know that the Basenji dog breed is known as the *"barkless dog"* because it doesn't bark like other dogs? Instead, it makes a unique yodel-like sound known as a *"barroo,"* due to the shape of its larynx.
24/11/23, 8:44 am - +263 71 679 6852: Morning

24/11/23, 8:47 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 8:48 am - +263 71 679 6852: Yes

27/11/23, 8:47 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Blessing!

Did you know that India and Africa share a rich history of diplomatic and trade relations that dates back centuries? The strong bond between these two regions has been further strengthened in recent years through collaborative efforts in various sectors, including trade, infrastructure, and technology.

Let us cherish this amazing bond, and start our session !
27/11/23, 8:48 am - +263 71 679 6852: Good morning
27/11/23, 8:54 am - +263 71 679 6852: Well my understanding is that EWYL program provides higher education which is accessible and affordable.It also helps achieve career goals and work towards a secured future.EWYL helps in acquiring skills according to advancement in technology such that they will be able to meet the current and future needs.This program helps students to interact with higher organisations which will assist in giving the students the skills needed for a particular career.
27/11/23, 8:58 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great,  I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
27/11/23, 8:58 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 8:58 am - +263 71 679 6852: Okay
27/11/23, 9:03 am - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
27/11/23, 9:03 am - +263 71 679 6852: Done
27/11/23, 9:07 am - +263 71 679 6852: To begin with corporate alliance,the main aim is to understand the market you will be working in the future and start preparing for it at a very early stage.The EWYL helps to connect with big companies through the digital or online marketing and helps communicate in terms of the skills needed for a particular career after graduation. This can be done through LinkedIn to search for the companies and communicate with the managers and know the number of employees in the organisation which will help a student to achieve their goals.

27/11/23, 9:12 am - Ananya Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
27/11/23, 9:20 am - +263 71 679 6852: Basically this is about searching for well known business start ups.This means that after a fully detailed research it will be then appropriate for the student to start communicating with them regarding how they achieve their organisational goals. Thereafter it will be proper to get them in contact with Edoofa such that they will organise a meeting and communicate about their business. This will then proceed to looking for their social media platforms as well as their progress then communicate with the founder about their financial background and how they managed to grow.
27/11/23, 9:24 am - Ananya Edoofa: You know what , this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.

*_Let's kick off our session with a fascinating scientific fact:_*

 The Eiffel Tower can actually be 15 cm taller during the summer. This happens because the iron expands in the heat and contracts in the winter, causing the height variation.🤯🗼

28/11/23, 8:51 am - Ananya Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
28/11/23, 8:51 am - +263 71 679 6852: Okay
28/11/23, 8:52 am - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
28/11/23, 8:52 am - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
28/11/23, 8:52 am - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
28/11/23, 8:52 am - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
28/11/23, 8:52 am - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
28/11/23, 8:52 am - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

28/11/23, 8:55 am - +263 71 679 6852: Okay ...
28/11/23, 8:57 am - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
28/11/23, 8:57 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
29/11/23, 9:23 am - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

I hope you're well. I wanted to discuss the timing of our sessions. If you can't make it on time, I might have to skip the session, as it's challenging for me to remind you each time. Tekk me, do your teachers send reminders before classes?
