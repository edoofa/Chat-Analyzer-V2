Let us begin our today's session with a small joke!🎄🧑🏽‍🎄🌟

What do you call Santa when he takes a break?

Santa Pause! 🎅⏸️
22/12/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 756 4664: 😅 afternoon mam how are you?
22/12/23, 1:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
22/12/23, 1:47 pm - +263 77 756 4664: No
22/12/23, 1:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
22/12/23, 1:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
22/12/23, 1:50 pm - +263 77 756 4664: Yes l understand very well now
22/12/23, 1:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Persistance, one of my students has _earned around 7,000 USD_ and paid his entire tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
22/12/23, 1:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/12/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 756 4664: This is amazing indeed l am done
22/12/23, 1:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
22/12/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 756 4664: Okay noted thank you l'm pleased to know them
22/12/23, 1:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
22/12/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 756 4664: Yes
22/12/23, 2:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
22/12/23, 2:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/12/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 756 4664: I am done this is amazing l am inspired
22/12/23, 2:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
22/12/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 756 4664: I liked the whole newsletter but mostly the inspirational but by Valerie
22/12/23, 2:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now since our session time is over, let us conclude it here and connect on Monday as we do not have our sessions over the weekend.
22/12/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 756 4664: Okay thank you have a great weekend
22/12/23, 2:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa added Akshit EWYL
