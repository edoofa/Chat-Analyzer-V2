I hope you are doing great! I wanted to let you know that I won't be able to connect today because I have some personal work that needs my urgent attention.

Meanwhile, I would recommend you to read the following document. Once you've gone through it, kindly send a practice email to yourself and cc me at ananyaa.edoofa@gmail.com before our next session.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect lately. Actually, we have initiated our orientation program in collaboration with our partner universities, which is why we were present at those institutions.
08/09/23, 8:35 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/09/23, 10:21 am - +263 78 465 0764: Good morning ma'am...that is okay i understand
09/09/23, 10:35 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings my Proud Edoofian!

Since schools are now open, and I don't want you to be diverted from your studies, I would like to ask about your schedule. This will help me plan our proceedings accordingly and ensure that we can stay connected even if you cannot attend your sessions.🤝🏽
09/09/23, 10:57 am - +263 78 465 0764: Góod morning ma'am. We end school leasons at 1600hrs. I will be free from then
11/09/23, 12:47 pm - +263 77 851 5686: Okay ma'am I will let you know as soon as am done
12/09/23, 4:40 pm - +263 78 465 0764: Good evening ma'am. I have sent the emails
15/09/23, 9:03 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Students!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:03 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on 
*Saturdays at 8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
15/09/23, 9:14 am - +263 77 294 3780: Morning how are you
15/09/23, 9:15 am - +263 77 294 3780: It's ok with me a parent... Tanatswa will respond soon
15/09/23, 12:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Can you please select your batch?
15/09/23, 12:21 pm - +263 78 465 0764: the first batch is suitable ma'am
15/09/23, 12:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, you know if you are available tomorrow at 8:30am, we can connect at that time as well.
15/09/23, 12:23 pm - +263 78 465 0764: i will be available ma'am
15/09/23, 12:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! See you tomorrow.
16/09/23, 8:39 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Parents and Tanatswa!

How are you doing today?
16/09/23, 8:45 am - +263 78 465 0764: Good morning ma'am...am okay and how are you doing
16/09/23, 8:48 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am thrilled to introduce myself as Ms. Ananya, your mentor for the EWYL program. Together, we will work hard and aim for the sky to earn maximum scholarship credits from this program.

So, are you ready to join me on this exciting journey? Let's work hard and reach for the stars!🌟
16/09/23, 8:52 am - +263 78 465 0764: Yes i am ready for this journey to commence
16/09/23, 9:13 am - Ananya Edoofa: The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
16/09/23, 9:20 am - +263 78 465 0764: No ma'am.
16/09/23, 9:31 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that NAME is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.
16/09/23, 9:31 am - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
16/09/23, 9:34 am - +263 78 465 0764: I now understand the two key objectives of the EWYL team
16/09/23, 9:35 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke, one of our students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
16/09/23, 9:36 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/09/23, 9:38 am - +263 78 465 0764: I have read the email Mihlayonke wrote ma'am
16/09/23, 9:38 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
16/09/23, 9:39 am - +263 78 465 0764: That's wonderful....i understand
16/09/23, 9:39 am - Ananya Edoofa: This message was deleted
16/09/23, 9:40 am - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates you to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
16/09/23, 9:41 am - +263 78 465 0764: yes it indeed sounds really interesting
16/09/23, 9:42 am - Ananya Edoofa: - Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once NAME forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
16/09/23, 9:42 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/09/23, 9:44 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Let us connect on *Monday from 8:30 am to 9:30 am*, to move forward with our sessions.
16/09/23, 9:53 am - +263 78 465 0764: Thank you...i have gone through the newsletter
18/09/23, 8:34 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, 

How are you? How was your weekend? Are you ready for your session?✨
19/09/23, 8:45 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, 

How are you? Are you ready for your session?✨
19/09/23, 5:59 pm - +263 78 465 0764: I apologise for my absence im today's session. My data bundle had depleted. I will read the document as asked. i once again apologise
20/09/23, 7:57 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Tanatswa!

Kindly submit your understaning before your session.
20/09/23, 8:27 am - +263 78 465 0764: yes ma'am
20/09/23, 8:37 am - Ananya Edoofa: Are you ready for the session now?
20/09/23, 9:58 am - +263 78 465 0764: i understood that the EDOOFA program is aiming in enhancing work skills and competencies of individuals. It aims at preparing individuals of what they will learn later in the work life, encouraging social relations with businesses that will help in later work interactions of students. This is further beneficial for students because students earn scholarship credits helping in the payment of the part of the school fees lessening the financial burden on parents
20/09/23, 9:58 am - +263 78 465 0764: This is my understanding ma'am
20/09/23, 9:59 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great!  Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
20/09/23, 10:00 am - +263 78 465 0764: Yes ma'am. We are on the same page
21/09/23, 8:33 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, 

How are you? Are you ready for your session?✨
21/09/23, 9:10 am - +263 78 465 0764: yes ma'am
21/09/23, 9:10 am - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Tuesday and Thursday - 9:30 am  to 11:00 am
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
21/09/23, 9:11 am - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line everyday by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
21/09/23, 9:11 am - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
21/09/23, 9:17 am - +263 78 465 0764: yes ma'am
21/09/23, 9:20 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now, we have finally reached the end. I am extremely happy that you took out time to understand how Tanatswa’s involvement in the EWYL program can bring her closer to reaching her career goals.

I would appreciate it if you discuss the understanding of all the sessions with her and explain the importance of discipline & consistency in the EWYL Journey.
21/09/23, 9:24 am - +263 78 465 0764: yes ma'am...after her reply?
21/09/23, 9:28 am - Ananya Edoofa: This message was deleted
21/09/23, 9:28 am - Ananya Edoofa: Which reply? @263784650764
21/09/23, 9:30 am - +263 78 465 0764: I sent her this message

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am Tanatswa Masterl and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is Tanatswa EWYL23E0560
21/09/23, 9:32 am - +263 78 465 0764: Do I share my understanding of the EWYL program only after she replies to the above message or I may proceed in sharing my understanding regardless
21/09/23, 9:32 am - Ananya Edoofa: May I ask if you wish to move forward with the sessions or you want to continue once your exams are over?
21/09/23, 9:33 am - +263 78 465 0764: I would prefer to continue after my exams are over
21/09/23, 9:34 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright then! All the best for your exams.✨
21/09/23, 9:35 am - +263 78 465 0764: Thank you very much
21/09/23, 9:40 am - +263 78 465 0764: Do I still regularly send the message saying "I am a proud EDOOFIAN" to Ms Ananya
21/09/23, 9:40 am - +263 78 465 0764: or I only send after my exams end
21/09/23, 9:43 am - Ananya Edoofa: After your exams.
21/09/23, 9:44 am - +263 78 465 0764: yes ma'am...Thank you once again
19/10/23, 8:43 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

I understand that you're currently dealing with exams, but I've shared a video with you to support your studies. As your mentor, I'm genuinely concerned about your progress and want to see you succeed in your examinations.

I must admit that I'm quite disappointed that there hasn't been a response from you. Communication is essential for us to work together effectively. If you have any concerns or questions, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Let's ensure we're on the same page and working toward your success.
30/10/23, 4:42 pm - +263 77 294 3780: how are you sir...sorry for not updating...Tanatswa had some problems with her for its not working properly...but she can get intouch here and there.

30/10/23, 4:43 pm - +263 77 294 3780: with her phone***
31/10/23, 7:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

I hope you are having a great start to the week. Edoofa is an organization that fosters careers and empowers students to progress in a more positive direction, achieving the right balance of exposure and opportunities, alongside education, is essential for a student's overall growth.

With this principle in mind, I am thrilled to share how our students are balancing correctly between exposure and experience with their academics:

⭕A group of our students recently participated in a football tournament, and we are immensely proud to announce that they reached the competition's semifinals.

⭕Another group of students participated in a debate competition, and I am delighted to add that two of our students emerged as winners.

⭕Furthermore, our students regularly come together for interactive sessions with their fellow Edoofians, building stronger relationships and providing mutual support.
31/10/23, 7:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: ◾ Being your mentor, as your child prepares to join us in India, I would like to know: What kind of skills or exposure would you want to be a part of during your time here?

07/11/23, 6:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Greetings, Tanatswa and parents,*

I hope this message finds you well amidst the ongoing examinations. I'm excited to share some fantastic news with you regarding the recent orientation held at Edoofa's partner colleges.

In these orientation programs, the primary aim was to bridge the gap between students and mentors. It provided the valuable opportunity for each student to meet their respective mentor, a crucial connection that will guide them throughout their EWYL and overall Edoofa's journey.

The session delved deep into the Earn While You Learn program, a path to financial independence while pursuing your education. We discussed strategies to maximize scholarship credits, ensuring our students make the most of this opportunity.

07/11/23, 6:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: But it wasn't all about it. We also had a fun chit-chat session, breaking the ice and building a sense of community.

Now, here's a question for both students and parents to ponder: What, in your opinion, are the key factors that will help you succeed in your Earn While You Learn journey? We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Keep up the good work with your exams, and remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Together, we'll make this journey an incredible success.
07/11/23, 6:57 pm - +263 77 294 3780: we are very fine thank you..good to hear from you
07/11/23, 6:59 pm - +263 77 294 3780: There are a few key factors that can help someone succeed in an earn while you learn  journey. First, it is important to have a clear goal in mind for what you want to achieve through the program. Second, it is important to have a good work ethic and be willing to put in the necessary effort to succeed. Third, it is important to be willing to learn new skills and take on new challenges. Fourth, it is important to build a good relationship with your employer or training provider. Fifth,it is important to have good communication skills and be able to work well with others etc...
17/11/23, 4:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, Tanatswa!
Hope you are doing well.

Our Edoofians in India lit up Diwali, the Festival of Lights, with unmatched enthusiasm. From radiant diyas to vibrant rangoli, their classrooms and homes sparkled with festive joy🪔.

Let us begin our session with a *FUN FACT*: 

Did you know that the Basenji dog breed is known as the *"barkless dog"* because it doesn't bark like other dogs? Instead, it makes a unique yodel-like sound known as a *"barroo,"* due to the shape of its larynx. <This message was edited>

Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?

*_Let's kick off our session with a fascinating scientific fact:_*

 The Eiffel Tower can actually be 15 cm taller during the summer. This happens because the iron expands in the heat and contracts in the winter, causing the height variation.🤯🗼
29/11/23, 8:27 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Tanataswa!

Try to answer!😄
06/12/23, 8:34 am - +263 78 465 0764: Good Morning ma'am

07/12/23, 8:33 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Tanatswa!

Did you know there's a big word, 'paraskavedekatriaphobia,' which means being afraid of Friday the 13th? Some folks get spooked on this day and avoid doing important stuff. 😵‍💫

But you know what's funny? Statistically, it's not more accident-prone than any other day. So, if someone tells you they're scared of Friday the 13th, you can just say it's all in their head!
07/12/23, 9:24 pm - +263 78 465 0764: Good evening ma'am
08/12/23, 8:27 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Tanatswa!

Due to some personal reasons, I won't be able to connect for our session today. However, I had a plan for our session, which I am stating now.

With years of experience, I want you to accumulate some credits before you come here to India. Students who have already earned some credits are living much better lives as they can help their parents with travel costs and even semester fees. I am sure you have also signed up for EWYL, so that you can do the same. As your mentor, I want to ensure that you utilize our services and earn for yourself. Now, have some faith in me and start working.

As a starting point, I have a small target for you for the day! Connect with at least *2 students* today under your community building project and submit the application forms to me by tomorrow. By tomorrow, you will either be successful with the two students or may face some challenges, on which we will work together!

All the best!
08/12/23, 9:02 am - +263 78 465 0764: Good morning ma'am
08/12/23, 9:03 am - +263 78 465 0764: Thank you I will gladly do the assignment
11/12/23, 8:29 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Tanatswa!

Before diving into today's session, I want to share a few highlights with you from the recent webinar that took place for our students here in India!🌟

https://www.instagram.com/p/C0jSIPrvg_1/
11/12/23, 8:45 am - +263 78 465 0764: Good morning ma'am
11/12/23, 8:47 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Tanatswa!

How are you doing?
11/12/23, 8:47 am - Ananya Edoofa: How was your weekend?
11/12/23, 8:53 am - +263 78 465 0764: I am fine thank you. And how are you
11/12/23, 8:53 am - +263 78 465 0764: It was good ma'am
11/12/23, 8:54 am - Ananya Edoofa: Well, it was amazing, I was working with my students' credits! It seems like my students are back with so much excitement. I am so happy with their work—everybody is so active while working on their projects. Many of my students are earning credits, and I am sure they will return to India with a lot of credits in their accounts!
11/12/23, 8:55 am - +263 78 465 0764: That's amazing indeed ma'am
11/12/23, 8:57 am - Ananya Edoofa: So, Today, we will be discussing the credits associated with Project Two!
So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
11/12/23, 9:03 am - +263 78 465 0764: Yes ma'am
11/12/23, 9:03 am - +263 78 465 0764: Thank you
11/12/23, 9:05 am - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
11/12/23, 9:05 am - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
11/12/23, 9:05 am - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
11/12/23, 9:05 am - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
11/12/23, 9:05 am - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
11/12/23, 9:05 am - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
11/12/23, 9:05 am - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

11/12/23, 9:12 am - +263 78 465 0764: Thank you
11/12/23, 9:13 am - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
11/12/23, 9:13 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

11/12/23, 9:13 am - Ananya Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:
11/12/23, 9:13 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
11/12/23, 9:13 am - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
11/12/23, 9:13 am - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
11/12/23, 9:13 am - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
11/12/23, 9:13 am - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.

13/12/23, 9:17 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Let me help you with the kind of communication that you should do with the school heads, okay?



Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:
Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
13/12/23, 9:26 am - +263 78 465 0764: Q1. Mabelreign Girls High School. Yes it is connected with EDOOFA
Q2. I would kindly tell them the affordable fees that EDOOFA has to offer for  higher education which can be accessible to every student
Q3. Harare
13/12/23, 9:31 am - Ananya Edoofa: Well, as per our records, your school is not connected with us.  I would like you to connect with your School Head. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all your schoolmates.
13/12/23, 9:35 am - +263 78 465 0764: Yes ma'am
13/12/23, 9:39 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Let us conclude today's session with a light joke!

Why don't skeletons fight each other?

They don't have the guts! 😄
13/12/23, 9:47 am - +263 78 465 0764: Thank you for the session ma'am
14/12/23, 8:34 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Tanatswa!

Let us begin today's session with an interesting question: _If you were allowed to spend a day in the life of a fictional character from any book or movie, who would it be and what adventures would you embark on?_
14/12/23, 8:43 am - +263 78 465 0764: Good morning maam
14/12/23, 8:45 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Tanatswa! How are you doing today?
14/12/23, 8:47 am - +263 78 465 0764: I am doing fine thanks and how are you
14/12/23, 8:48 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am good, so may I ask if you have the Whatsapp contact of the School Head? <This message was edited>
14/12/23, 8:53 am - +263 78 465 0764: Yes, i do
14/12/23, 8:56 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now that you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
14/12/23, 8:56 am - Ananya Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
14/12/23, 8:56 am - Ananya Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_

Greetings Mr./Mrs *School Head Name*!
Hope you are doing well.

I am *Your Name* and I am a beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
I stand obliged to get an opportunity to connect with you, I hope to have a result/conclusion-driven conversation with you today.

May I know at what time you will be available to connect via Whatsapp?
14/12/23, 9:00 am - +263 78 465 0764: Yes ma'am i will connect
14/12/23, 9:03 am - Ananya Edoofa: Once you get a response from the school head about their available time, do let me know so that I can share some valuable resources with you.
14/12/23, 9:07 am - +263 78 465 0764: Yes ma'am
14/12/23, 9:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now, we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
14/12/23, 9:09 am - +263 78 465 0764: I do not have any questions so far ma'am
14/12/23, 9:10 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
14/12/23, 9:15 am - +263 78 465 0764: Yes ma'am
14/12/23, 9:15 am - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Tuesday  and Friday-  12:00 pm to 1:30 pm
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
14/12/23, 9:15 am - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
14/12/23, 9:15 am - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
14/12/23, 9:17 am - +263 78 465 0764: Yes ma'am.
14/12/23, 9:31 am - Ananya Edoofa: This message was deleted
18/12/23, 10:32 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Tanatswa!

How are you doing today? I have an amazing opportunity for you, can I know if you are available to discuss that?
18/12/23, 10:33 am - +263 77 851 5686: Good morning ma'am Tanatswa is currently out of town
18/12/23, 10:36 am - Ananya Edoofa: May I know when I will be able to connect with Tanatswa?
18/12/23, 10:37 am - +263 77 851 5686: Possibly tomorrow
18/12/23, 11:10 am - Ananya Edoofa: I hope this message finds you well. I am delighted to share some fantastic news about Tanatswa!

We have established a special group for students from your school, and after careful consideration, our team has selected four exceptional students to serve as leaders in this group as Edoofian representatives. I'm thrilled to inform you that Tanatswa is one of the chosen students!

As part of this exciting role, we are inviting Tanatswa to share their personal journey in the group with Edoofa. From counseling sessions to EWYL experiences, we want to hear all about the positive changes Tanatswa has noticed within themselves. They can jot down their thoughts and share them with us, and I'll be happy to assist with proofreading.

Here's the exciting part: for every student from that group who enrolls in our program, Tanatswa will earn $5 per student! It's an incredible opportunity for Tanatswa to not only showcase their leadership skills but also earn rewards for their efforts.

We're looking forward to Tanatswa's active participation in the group and witnessing the positive impact they'll make as a student leader.
19/12/23, 12:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tanatswa!

Your EWYL session is about to start. Join the EWYL line as we are going to learn some new skills today! 🏆
19/12/23, 3:55 pm - +263 78 465 0764: Good afternoon ma'am
22/12/23, 12:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tanatswa!

I hope you're well. I wanted to discuss the timing of our sessions. If you can't make it on time, I might have to skip the session, as it's challenging for me to remind you each time. Tekk me, do your teachers send reminders before classes?
22/12/23, 1:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa added Akshit EWYL
22/12/23, 1:45 pm - +263 78 465 0764: I am deeply sorry ma'am. I have been out of town in Mhondoro for the past week as it is Christmas holidays. I promise to be punctual from now on. I once again apologise
22/12/23, 4:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, however since our session time is over, we will connect in our next session which is on Tuesday. Meanwhile, start connecting with other students as well. Use social media, and try connecting with your school juniors to widen your community for the second project! Start exploring and working so that you can submit at least 2 application forms with me by tomorrow! Utilize the weekend. Now, let us conclude our session here, and we shall reconnect on Tuesday. Make sure to follow your EWYL ritual tomorrow, as I will be sharing your weekend activity.
22/12/23, 5:00 pm - +263 78 465 0764: Yes ma'am
