04/08/23, 2:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, may I ask if you were able to find the contact number of your school head?
04/08/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 071 1959: No I wasn't able since the assistant denied me the phone number
04/08/23, 2:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I understand, you can move forward and find the contacts of other school heads as well.
04/08/23, 2:22 pm - +263 78 071 1959: Very well Ms Ananya will do that
04/08/23, 2:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great!  Now, Adrian we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
04/08/23, 3:41 pm - +263 78 071 1959: My apologies for not communicating back. There was a power outage this side so they were trying to fix it and it took longer than expected to fix.
04/08/23, 3:43 pm - +263 78 071 1959: I would like to be enlightened more on the part of doing project one. Can please re-explain for which companies because I am struggling to understand nerh
04/08/23, 3:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I understand. Well, project one is currently on hold. We will have a separate session on that when we will resume it.
04/08/23, 3:56 pm - +263 78 071 1959: Ohhh okay very well noted
04/08/23, 3:57 pm - +263 78 071 1959: That was the only question I had
04/08/23, 4:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Adrian, you were quite irregular in your session and I want to say that it was not a fruitful session. I hope we shall connect on Monday now as we do not have our sessions on Saturday and Sunday!
04/08/23, 4:10 pm - +263 78 071 1959: Very well noted and my apologies on my part.
07/08/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 071 1959: Good day Ms Ananya. How are you???
07/08/23, 1:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, my Proud Edoofian!

How are you today? Are you ready for your session?🚀
07/08/23, 1:56 pm - +263 78 071 1959: Yes I am ready for our session today.
07/08/23, 1:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: It’s amazing to be your partner in this EWYL journey. Till now, we’ve spoken to each other about our goals for this year, the promise of earning and learning well through this program, we went over 3 of the projects specially curated for Edoofians to get started with earning scholarship credits and their journey of learning relevant skills like communication, networking, and leadership to name a few.
07/08/23, 1:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!
07/08/23, 1:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *So, are you excited to find out what this is?*
07/08/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 071 1959: I am very much excited.I cannot wait to hear about it.
07/08/23, 2:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!
 Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.
07/08/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 071 1959: Very well noted. Sounds interesting.
07/08/23, 2:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *SEO* - Search engine optimization is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic rather than direct traffic or paid traffic.

*Influencer marketing* - Influencer marketing is a form of social media marketing involving endorsements and product placement from influencers, people, and organizations who have a purported expert level of knowledge or social influence in their field.

*Blog writing*- Blogging refers to writing, photography, and other media that are self-published online. Blogging started as an opportunity for individuals to write diary-style entries, but it has since been incorporated into websites for many businesses.
07/08/23, 2:04 pm - +263 78 071 1959: Noted.
07/08/23, 2:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, Adrian, since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
07/08/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 071 1959: Very well noted Ms Ananya.
07/08/23, 2:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: There are a few additional things that are required for you to be selected for a project. I want you to share the following with me
1. Instagram Username
2. Facebook Username
3. A smiling photo of yours ✨ 
→ IN case you do not have an Instagram/Facebook account- I want you to create one, and then send it in the next 24-36 hours.
07/08/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 071 1959: Instagram username: Munashe Adrian Rupango
Facebook username: Adrian Munashe Rupango
07/08/23, 2:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.

Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line everydayby saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

09/11/23, 10:19 am - Ananya Edoofa: Adrian, I want you inform you that I'll be away from 10th Oct to 13th Oct, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Thursday at 9:30 a.m.* once the echoes of fireworks settle down.
09/11/23, 10:20 am - Ananya Edoofa: You know, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉
