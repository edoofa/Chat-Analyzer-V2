15/09/23, 4:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Tadiwanashe
I hope that you are doing well. It has been a while since we last connected. 
I have been reminding you to message on the EWYL Line so that we can proceed with our scheduled sessions so that you don't miss out on the opportunities to earn scholarship credits and learn from the industrial academia that has been specifically curated for our Edoofians.

May I know what exactly is the challenge?
15/09/23, 4:52 pm - +263 78 826 2620: Good day .........l am writing my exams soon so l will be busy reading
15/09/23, 4:58 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Tadiwanashe, thank you for the update.
I understand that the examinations are round the corner. I would also like to inform you that most of my other students will also be writing their exam this October. 
But these students have also been devoting at least half an hour a day for their EWYL learning. Most of them are still doing their projects. 
I wanted to keep you informed about this because of the sincerity and responsibility you have shown in the last sessions.

Quite a lot of them have already earned $500 to $6oo amount of scholarship credits.
15/09/23, 7:37 pm - +263 78 826 2620: l will try my level best
15/09/23, 8:27 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Okay, looking forward to it.
29/09/23, 5:50 am - +263 78 826 2620: Good morning l am a proud edoofian ......

29/09/23, 8:08 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning Tadiwanashe
I hope you are doing well

But, please understand for now we have put the forst project on hold and we are only working on projects 2 and projec 3 which are Community Building Project and African School Reforms consecutively.

09/11/23, 12:08 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Hey Tadiwanashe!*

Hope this message finds you in high spirits! 🌟 As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.
09/11/23, 12:16 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉
