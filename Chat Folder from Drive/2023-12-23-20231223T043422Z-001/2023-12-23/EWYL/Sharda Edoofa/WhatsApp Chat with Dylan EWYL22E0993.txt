How are you?

Can you please let me know if you are available for your EWYL sessions?

I am equally thrilled to hear that.
01/09/23, 10:48 am - +263 71 730 6310: Great
01/09/23, 12:39 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Daylan Can you please tell if your previous mentor has discussed the 3 projects (Corporate Alliance, Community Building and African School Reforms)?

This will help me get an understanding or carrying forward our discussion from the exact place.
08/09/23, 2:54 pm - +91 85956 45071 left
15/09/23, 9:19 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Dylan

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
18/09/23, 2:21 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Okay Noted!
18/09/23, 2:21 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Are you ready for the session today?
18/09/23, 3:01 pm - +263 71 250 0022: Yes
18/09/23, 3:06 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am thrilled to be Dylan’S mentor. Before connecting today, I was given the responsibility for Dylan’S application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about from Dylan's counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of  Dylan's application, particularly the desire to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of collective growth has always been my interest.
18/09/23, 3:30 pm - +263 71 250 0022: Okay ma’am good to know and we are also looking forward to work with you
18/09/23, 8:12 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Thank you for your kind words!
21/09/23, 2:20 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon 

Hope you are doing well!

It's a pleasure to have you join me for this scheduled session
Are you ready for an enriching learning experience ?
21/09/23, 2:23 pm - +263 71 250 0022: Good afternoon ma’am
21/09/23, 2:23 pm - +263 71 250 0022: Yes um ready
21/09/23, 2:29 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
21/09/23, 2:31 pm - +263 71 250 0022: Let me give a try 
1: earn while you learn
2: every child to get good quality of education
21/09/23, 2:33 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, you are almost close
21/09/23, 2:33 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Dylan is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.
21/09/23, 2:33 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
21/09/23, 2:35 pm - +263 71 250 0022: Thank you well understood
21/09/23, 2:37 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke, one of our students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
21/09/23, 2:37 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/09/23, 2:38 pm - +263 71 250 0022: Okay on it
21/09/23, 2:39 pm - +263 71 250 0022: Wow impressive job I wish Dylan to do the same
21/09/23, 2:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, ofcouse why not.
 Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*.
21/09/23, 2:41 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
21/09/23, 2:41 pm - Sharda Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
21/09/23, 2:43 pm - +263 71 250 0022: My great pleasure working with you Ms Sanjana and Ms Davi hope I find you well iam Dylans sister iam Pauline Chikanya
21/09/23, 3:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Thank you for your cooperation.
21/09/23, 3:03 pm - +263 71 250 0022: Welcome 🙏
21/09/23, 3:06 pm - Sharda Edoofa: - I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates *Dylan* to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
21/09/23, 3:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once *Dylan* forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
21/09/23, 3:08 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/09/23, 2:13 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon

28/09/23, 2:17 pm - +263 71 250 0022: Okay ma’am I will surely do so
28/09/23, 2:18 pm - Sharda Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for *Dylan*’S EWYL journey:
28/09/23, 2:18 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure *Dylan* is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
28/09/23, 2:18 pm - +263 71 250 0022: Okay ma’am
28/09/23, 2:18 pm - Sharda Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that *Dylan* will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
28/09/23, 2:19 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/09/23, 2:19 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how *Dylan* can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
28/09/23, 2:22 pm - +263 71 250 0022: On it now

I hope everything's going well with your exam preparations. I just wanted to let you know that I'm here to support you all the way until your exams are done. If you need any help or have questions, don't hesitate to reach out.

By the way, Dussehra, a significant Hindu festival, just happened recently. It's a celebration of good triumphing over evil, and it's a time for joy and reflection. I'd appreciate your insights if you were already familiar with this festival.
Wishing you all the best in your exams.

31/10/23, 5:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings dear parents and Dylan @263717306310 @263712500022 
I have noticed your unresponsiveness in the group. I would like to understand if everything is alright at your end. 

We're delighted to share that some of our students have been actively engaging in extracurricular activities, such as a recent basketball tournament, where they showcased their skills and teamwork.

Additionally, I am excited to inform you that after our students come to India, we also host regular gatherings where students come together, enjoy conversations, and even sing together. These events provide a warm sense of community, and our *Edoofa Welfare officer* joins in to make them even more special.

I am keen to know about your preferences as well. What kind of activities would you like to get involved in after coming to India? Whether it's sports, cultural events, or any other interests, please share your thoughts.

Now, here's a question for both students and parents to ponder: What, in your opinion, are the key factors that will help you succeed in your Earn While You Learn journey? We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Keep up the good work with your exams, and remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Together, we'll make this journey an incredible success.

This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?

Here is the message -
24/11/23, 2:57 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

04/12/23, 3:20 pm - +263 71 595 8754: 2. Dear principal 

Am Dylan Chikanya a proud edoofian who earned a scholarship of high quality education through hardworking. I am here with an opportunity that can also be accessed by every student at your school. 
If u can allow me can I tell you more about Edoofa?
04/12/23, 3:43 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree? 

Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
04/12/23, 3:43 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
04/12/23, 3:43 pm - Sharda Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_

I hope this message finds you well. Allow me to introduce myself as a student of your esteemed institution. I am writing to share some exciting news.

I have been honored with the privilege of being selected for the Edoofa scholarship program. Through this incredible opportunity, I have been granted the chance to pursue my higher education in India, and what makes it even more remarkable is that this scholarship covers 50-100% of my educational expenses.

I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this further with you. Could you please let me know when it would be convenient for you to connect via WhatsApp?
04/12/23, 3:44 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Dylan, it would be more advantageous if you could tailor and modify this message according to your preferences, and please refrain from sending the same message as is.*
04/12/23, 3:44 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *It is time to wrap up our session.* 
You joined the session very late due to which we didn't get to some key discussions; please participate actively as I trust you recognize how valuable the EWYL session is.
Also, from next time be available in time without any delays.
05/12/23, 1:51 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon Dylan

06/12/23, 1:54 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.*
06/12/23, 1:54 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:

1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
06/12/23, 5:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Now that the time is over, we're wrapping up our session. It was a fantastic session, and I'm looking forward to our next session*.
07/12/23, 1:44 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon Dylan

As we embark on today's session, let's kick-start our journey with a dose of inspiration from Jeff Bezos, the visionary founder of Amazon:

Your brand is what other people say about you when you're not in the room
Now, what does this mean to you?
Imagine you're creating your personal brand every day. It's not just about how you see yourself; it's about the impression you leave on others. Whether you're in the classroom, chatting with friends, or pursuing your hobbies, you're shaping your brand—the way people perceive you.

So, let's dive into today's session with the mindset of crafting a brand that reflects your strengths, values, and aspirations. Together, we'll explore ways to amplify your unique qualities and set the stage for success, not just academically, but in every aspect of your lives.

Remember, each interaction, each achievement, contributes to your brand. Let's make it a story of growth, resilience, and positive impact!
