11/10/23, 10:35 am - +263 77 492 3669: Good day sir.
We are about to start our A level examinations this side and I might not be available online for our sessions for about three weeks.

Thank you so much for notifying about your last examination date.
26/10/23, 2:57 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good day, Gerald and parents! @263774923669 
I hope everything's going well with your exam preparations.

I also wanted to let you know that I'm here to support you all the way until your exams are done. If you need any help or have questions, don't hesitate to reach out.

By the way, Dussehra, a significant Hindu festival, just happened recently. It's a celebration of good triumphing over evil, and it's a time for joy and reflection. I'd appreciate your insights if you were already familiar with this festival.
Wishing you all the best in your exams.

I am not Aware of the festival ma'am and I'd be delighted if you tell me more about it
26/10/23, 4:53 pm - +263 77 492 3669: This looks interesting ma'am
26/10/23, 4:58 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Great.
26/10/23, 4:59 pm - Sharda Edoofa: This message was deleted
26/10/23, 4:59 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Certainly! Dussehra is a big Indian festival that's all about good defeating evil. It celebrates the victory of a prince named Rama over a demon king called Ravana. Rama rescued his wife Sita with the help of his friends and a special bow. People light up fireworks and have parades to mark this happy day.

But Dussehra is not just about a story; it's also a time for family, fun, and food. People dress up in colorful clothes, visit fairs, and enjoy yummy sweets. They also exchange gifts and greetings. The festival lasts for ten days, and on the final day, giant effigies of Ravana, his brother Kumbhakarna, and son Meghnad are burned with fireworks, symbolizing the victory of good over evil in a grand way.

And the best part? Dussehra teaches us some important life lessons. It reminds us that no matter how powerful evil may seem, goodness and truth always win in the end. It encourages us to be brave and stand up against injustice. The festival also promotes unity and togetherness as people from different backgrounds come together to celebrate. It's a time to forgive and forget, mending relationships and starting anew.

So, it's like a mix of a thrilling story, delicious treats, and lots of celebrations, all while sharing meaningful messages about courage, unity, and the triumph of good values in life. 🌟🤝🕊️🎆🎁🍬

21/12/23, 7:53 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning Roy 
I hope you are doing well

 I have observed your unavailability in our session for quite a long time. You have not only been unavailable  but unresponsive to the messages  that have been sent to you. 

You are now in Africa and soon after a few months you will be here in India. Please understand that if you continue to stay active in your EWYL sessions in Africa, your transition to your college will be extremely smooth. 
If you will stay active in  the sessions you will also work on the projects. Your efforts in the project work will help you earn scholarship credits and honestly there is no limit to how much scholarship credits you can earn. 

This is the perfect time to master your skills like reading, communication, comprehension, persuasion and many more and you get to learn all these during your sessions and while working on projects. 

In no time, your efforts will make you competent and financially independent. You will not have to burden your parents for your fee and other expenses when you will have enough scholarship credits in advance. 

Kindly understand the importance of how crucial this time is for your growth and financial independence. 
I am looking forward to hearing your thoughts and I am here to help you in every step.
21/12/23, 8:01 am - +263 77 492 3669: Good day ma'am.
I am sorry for not being active these past days I was having some technical difficulties.
21/12/23, 8:11 am - Sharda Edoofa: Okay Roy, I can consider this as a concern. 
So, do you confirm your availability for our upcoming sessions?

21/12/23, 8:11 am - Sharda Edoofa: I hope you do realize that it's you who is lagging behind and your other peers are way ahead.
21/12/23, 8:13 am - Sharda Edoofa: So we will resume our session today onwards *from 8:30 AM to 9:30 AM* and your sessions will be held from *Monday to Friday.* 
No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.
As now you are an Edoofian, *being punctual should be an inherent trait and I hope that as the clock strikes 8:30,* you come for the sessions for your fruitful EWYL Journey.
21/12/23, 8:13 am - Sharda Edoofa: Kindly confirm your availability.

21/12/23, 8:26 am - Sharda Edoofa: 🎄 Ho Ho Ho, Seasons Greetings, Roy ! 🎅

Gather 'round, festive comrades! It's time to sleigh the day with a bit of yuletide fun and mental gymnastics. Let's unwrap the joy with a Christmas conundrum that's as delightful as a stocking full of goodies:

🤔 Riddle me this: Why was the snowman looking through the carrots?

While you ponder that wintry mystery, let's dive into our festive festivities. Get ready for a session filled with holiday wisdom and merrymaking. Remember, the answer to the riddle might just light up your face as brightly as Rudolph's nose! 🦌🌟
21/12/23, 8:33 am - +263 77 492 3669: I aam ready for the session ma'am
21/12/23, 8:35 am - +263 77 492 3669: The answer to your riddle is maybe we was trying to find the perfect one for his nose or maybe he wanted a particularly straight, round, or shiny carrot to complete his look.
21/12/23, 8:42 am - Sharda Edoofa: Drumroll, please! 🥁 The answer to the Christmas riddle is...

Because he was picking his nose!

Ah, the classic frosty humor. Now, let's continue our session with the same lighthearted spirit. May your day be as merry and bright as a tree adorned with twinkling lights! 🎄😄

Here is the message -
21/12/23, 10:13 am - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

22/12/23, 8:39 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning Roy
Hope your holiday prep is smoother than Santa's sleigh ride—any tips for the rest of us? Drop 'em in the chat and let's compare notes! 🎁

And here's a quick joke to sprinkle some laughter on our virtual snow globe: Why was the math book sad during the holidays? Because it had too many "problems"! 🤣

Now, let's sleigh through a session that's both holly and jolly! 🎅🌟
22/12/23, 9:15 am - +263 77 492 3669: Good day Ms. Sharda
22/12/23, 9:17 am - +263 77 492 3669: Let's get started
22/12/23, 9:20 am - Sharda Edoofa: Roy, why are you this late for the session?
22/12/23, 9:20 am - Sharda Edoofa: Kindly write answers to these questions.
22/12/23, 9:22 am - +263 77 492 3669: I am very sorry for being late ma'am. I had been sent on some errands
22/12/23, 9:25 am - +263 77 492 3669: 1.My former school is Sizane High School . Yes, it is connected with Edoofa.
2. I will share them shortly.
3. Bulawayo Province
22/12/23, 9:25 am - Sharda Edoofa: It is alright, Roy.
22/12/23, 9:27 am - Sharda Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
22/12/23, 9:27 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
22/12/23, 9:34 am - +263 77 492 3669: I agree ma'am.
The only challenge I faced last time I did this project was that most schools we visited that are around Bulawayo Bulawayo Province already have Edoofa in their schools or they had heard of it before or my other fellow colleagues had already visited them doing the same project. So of all the schools in Bulawayo I only managed to get those four schools I sent which had never heard of Edoofa before.
22/12/23, 9:36 am - Sharda Edoofa: Thank you for the update, Roy. I am glad to know you have been putting great efforts and I will also get back to you with the update regarding those four schools.
22/12/23, 9:36 am - Sharda Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_
22/12/23, 9:36 am - Sharda Edoofa: I hope this message finds you well. Allow me to introduce myself as a student of your esteemed institution. I am writing to share some exciting news.
I have been honored with the privilege of being selected for the Edoofa scholarship program. Through this incredible opportunity, I have been granted the chance to pursue my higher education in India, and what makes it even more remarkable is that this scholarship covers 50-100% of my educational expenses.
I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this further with you. Could you please let me know when it would be convenient for you to connect via WhatsApp?
22/12/23, 9:36 am - Sharda Edoofa: *Roy, it would be more advantageous if you could tailor and modify this message according to your preferences, and please refrain from sending the same message as is.*
22/12/23, 9:37 am - +263 77 492 3669: Okay ma'am.
Thank you
22/12/23, 9:38 am - +263 77 492 3669: Thank you ma'am
22/12/23, 9:39 am - +263 77 492 3669: I will keep on finding some other schools without the Edoofa program and I will use this message and modify it too.

22/12/23, 9:41 am - Sharda Edoofa: great Roy.
22/12/23, 9:41 am - Sharda Edoofa: After the headmaster replies and gives you a specific time for the conversation. You can share detailed information about the Edoofa Scholarship Program. 
Here are some of the facts that will help you out.
22/12/23, 9:41 am - Sharda Edoofa: Today, I am thrilled to introduce you to a scholarship program that has the potential to fulfill all the dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA - Education For All.

22/12/23, 10:45 am - +263 77 492 3669: Yes ma'am. I am here.
I was just going through all the messages more than once sso that I can have a better understanding.

22/12/23, 11:03 am - Sharda Edoofa: Okay Roy.
22/12/23, 11:03 am - Sharda Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:

1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
