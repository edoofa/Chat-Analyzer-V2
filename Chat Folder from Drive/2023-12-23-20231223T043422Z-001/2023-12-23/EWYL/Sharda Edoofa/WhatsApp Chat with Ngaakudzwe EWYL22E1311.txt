I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Sharda your new mentor will contact you on Tuesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Sharda's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.

I hope everything's going well with your exam preparations. 

Since I did not get any response from you, I wanted to know if everything is alright at your end. May I know what is the ongoing challenge?

I also wanted to let you know that I'm here to support you all the way until your exams are done. If you need any help or have questions, don't hesitate to reach out.

By the way, Dussehra, a significant Hindu festival, just happened recently. It's a celebration of good triumphing over evil, and it's a time for joy and reflection. I'd appreciate your insights if you were already familiar with this festival.
Wishing you all the best in your exams.

26/10/23, 6:22 pm - +263 77 513 2646: The main challenge for Mrs Mangono and Ngaakudzwe is the unreliable network. Since we moved from Masvingo Christian to Dewure we have met with network challenges. Ngaakudzwe' time table starts at 0700 hrs and ends at 2200 hrs when he finishes evening studies. He is also in the middle of his exams.
26/10/23, 6:57 pm - +1 (857) 939-7670: Thank you for your patience, Ms Sharda. 

I think the challenges laid out above, and thanks for your support and sharing some of your activities and national holidays. 

We have heard some information about the holiday and including Diwali, but it’s really not common in Zimbabwe to be aware of Indian holidays unless you know someone or watch specific information and channels. So thanks for sharing. Otherwise, it looks like a complete and successful burning of the rival god!
26/10/23, 10:43 pm - +263 77 513 2646: Thank you for sharing.
31/10/23, 5:05 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings dear parents and Ngaakudzwe

We're delighted to share that some of our students have been actively engaging in extracurricular activities, such as a recent basketball tournament, where they showcased their skills and teamwork.

Additionally, I am excited to inform you that after our students come to India, we also host regular gatherings where students come together, enjoy conversations, and even sing together. These events provide a warm sense of community, and our *Edoofa Welfare officer* joins in to make them even more special.

I am keen to know about your preferences as well. What kind of activities would you like to get involved in after coming to India? Whether it's sports, cultural events, or any other interests, please share your thoughts.
31/10/23, 5:56 pm - +263 71 449 1907: Good day Ms Sharda. I am very excited to learn of these events. I would really enjoy participating in cricket events as well as others like chess, debate and quiz.

Your interest in chess, debate, and quiz is impressive. These activities offer a great mix of strategic thinking, communication skills, and general knowledge.

01/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 71 449 1907: I love chess the most of the above mentioned because it offers a lot of knowledge when it comes to strategies and planning
01/11/23, 4:42 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Thank you so much for sharing your insights, I am glad to know you have interests other than acdemics.
01/11/23, 6:16 pm - +263 71 449 1907: Yes. These extracurricular activities often kept me busy when l wasn't reading

05/12/23, 8:29 am - Sharda Edoofa: "Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning." - Bill Gates

This quote by Bill Gates reminds us that challenges and feedback, even if tough, are invaluable for growth. Embracing constructive criticism turns setbacks into opportunities. Let's dive into today's session with a mindset of continuous learning and improvement.
05/12/23, 8:31 am - +263 71 449 1907: Thank you for the words of wisdom Ms Sharda. I will try to adopt that mindset
05/12/23, 8:36 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yes you must.
05/12/23, 8:36 am - Sharda Edoofa: Imagine you have a lemonade stand, and sometimes people say they don't like your lemonade. Bill Gates is saying that even when customers are unhappy, it's like a super useful lesson. It helps you make your lemonade better and become an expert lemonade maker! So, whenever things don't go perfectly, see it as a chance to learn and make things even more awesome next time.
05/12/23, 8:36 am - Sharda Edoofa: Let us now shift our attention to the project discussion.

05/12/23, 8:56 am - Sharda Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
05/12/23, 8:57 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 9:00 am - Sharda Edoofa: You can go through the document after our session today.

LinkedIn Profile Link:
05/12/23, 9:09 am - +263 71 449 1907: I already have accounts on all the above social media platforms

For instance, on LinkedIn, you can enter "Education" in the search bar after logging in. Similarly, on Google, you can search for terms like "Small-scale educational companies in African countries." This search will display various websites that might contain information about different companies. We can then review these companies and search for the necessary details using LinkedIn and Google.
05/12/23, 9:28 am - Sharda Edoofa: *Now, there is an update that I would like to share with you-*

Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for now. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.
In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄
05/12/23, 9:29 am - Sharda Edoofa: Sure we can get to that once we resume the project work on this prticular project.

05/12/23, 9:50 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 9:50 am - Sharda Edoofa: After you go through the audio, I would appreciate it if you could briefly share your understanding of the audio.
05/12/23, 10:12 am - +263 71 449 1907: Okay. Let me listen to it
05/12/23, 10:20 am - +263 71 449 1907: Ive listened carefully to the audio and learnt more about the community building project is all about the students communication skills and whether or not they are able to successfully deliver the information about edoofa to other people and students the way the Edoofa counselors did. It is also about building up the Edoofa community so other students may get the same opportunity.
05/12/23, 10:23 am - Sharda Edoofa: That’s awesome-, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team.
05/12/23, 10:23 am - Sharda Edoofa: Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project. Are you ready?

_Through WhatsApp community groups_
05/12/23, 10:24 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 10:24 am - Sharda Edoofa: Is everything clear until now?
05/12/23, 10:32 am - +263 71 449 1907: Yes everything is very clear
05/12/23, 10:34 am - Sharda Edoofa: Great.
05/12/23, 10:34 am - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
05/12/23, 10:34 am - Sharda Edoofa: 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
05/12/23, 10:34 am - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
05/12/23, 10:35 am - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends

I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 

I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.

Best of Luck!

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
05/12/23, 11:23 am - +263 71 449 1907: A1. Dewure High school. No it is not connected with Edoofa

A2.

A3. Masvingo Province
05/12/23, 11:24 am - +263 71 449 1907: Could you please explain to me question number 2. I seem kind of lost
05/12/23, 12:17 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Sure.
05/12/23, 12:17 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
05/12/23, 12:31 pm - +263 71 449 1907: Yes l agree with you there
05/12/23, 12:51 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Great.
05/12/23, 12:52 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
05/12/23, 12:52 pm - Sharda Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_

I hope this message finds you well. Allow me to introduce myself as a student of your esteemed institution. I am writing to share some exciting news.

I have been honored with the privilege of being selected for the Edoofa scholarship program. Through this incredible opportunity, I have been granted the chance to pursue my higher education in India, and what makes it even more remarkable is that this scholarship covers 50-100% of my educational expenses.

I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this further with you. Could you please let me know when it would be convenient for you to connect via WhatsApp?
05/12/23, 12:52 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Ngaakudzwe, it would be more advantageous if you could tailor and modify this message according to your preferences, and please refrain from sending the same message as is.*
05/12/23, 1:02 pm - +263 71 449 1907: Thank you for the template. I will alter it to suite the the recipient
05/12/23, 1:19 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Okay Great.

05/12/23, 1:21 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.*
05/12/23, 1:21 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
05/12/23, 1:21 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

*After having a keen observation, I would like to re-iterate a few important pointers that will help us in having a smooth session.*
Recently, there have been some irregularities in your attendance for our sessions on the EWYL Line from your end.
Consistent attendance from you contributes significantly to a dynamic and fruitful learning environment for all.

*Action Plan for an Outstanding Session:*

*Session Schedule:* Our sessions take place twice a week on *Tuesday and Friday, from 9:30 am to 11:00 am.*
*Wednesday Lesson:* Every Wednesday, a valuable lesson will be shared on the EWYL Line. Kindly write Wednesday  Lesson on the line before 9:30 am.
*Saturday Activity:* On Saturdays, an engaging activity will be posted on the EWYL Line. Please write Saturday Activity before 9:30 am.

*Punctuality Matters:* Aim to join the line 5 minutes early, confirming your readiness. This small gesture ensures we make the most of our scheduled sessions and unlocks undiscovered benefits.
*Discouraging Reminders:* Instead of relying on constant reminders, let's cultivate the habit of being mindful of our class timings and being available for our scheduled sessions. It speaks volumes about your commitment.
*Daily Affirmation:* Don't forget to maintain the ritual of declaring *'I am a proud Edoofian'* daily on the EWYL Line.
19/12/23, 1:57 pm - +263 71 449 1907: Good morning Ms Sharda. I have noted your pointers and schedule. I would like to put to your attention that l come on to the EWYL line each day in the morning and state the motto.

There is *no deadline for the project.*

There is *no limit on how much you have to do a project.*
There is *no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.*

It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
