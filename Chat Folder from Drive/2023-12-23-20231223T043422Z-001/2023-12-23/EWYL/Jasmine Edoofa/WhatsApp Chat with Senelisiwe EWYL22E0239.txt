In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.

Monday is a *national holiday* in India as we celebrate Mahatma Gandhi's birthday.

Dear, I want you to realize that you have missed the sessions for the past two months. It is really surprising to see that this is not bothering you. You could have used some other device to come for the sessions or you could have reached out to me to help you understand everything on a call. 

It has almost been a year and you have only earned 27$. Are you not willing to work in the EWYL Program? 
Don't you want to help your parents with the finances?
