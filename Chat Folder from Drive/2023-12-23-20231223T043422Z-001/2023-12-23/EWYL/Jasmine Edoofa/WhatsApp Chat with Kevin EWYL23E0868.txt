So that I can ensure that we both are on the same page.
09/11/23, 9:28 am - +263 78 082 7631: The EWYL program is a program set to help students financially incase they are not able to afford the annual fee. Students are given projects to work on so that they earn scholarship credits. The more they earn scholarship credits the lower the annual fee goes i.e if the fee is $2000 and a student earns $1600 worth scholarship credits the fees decreases to $400. There is no limit to earning scholarship credits
09/11/23, 9:28 am - +263 78 082 7631: That is much of what I understood.
09/11/23, 9:30 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, that’s correct!

09/11/23, 10:12 am - Jasmine Edoofa: As we conclude for the day, I'd like to inform you about the _*upcoming grand festival, Diwali, on November 12, 2023,*_ 🪔

Much like Christmas for us, it's a time when everyone eagerly anticipates reuniting with family. Diwali symbolizes the triumph of good over evil through the radiance of lights🕯️

Wishing you a joyous Diwali filled with light and prosperity. 
Have a splendid day ahead!

I hope this message finds you in great spirits after the Diwali break! Let's use this post-Diwali phase to illuminate our minds with newfound knowledge, enthusiasm, and a commitment to excellence. Just as the diyas 🪔 light up the darkest corners, let our collective efforts brighten the path to success.

Now, *I would like to remind you that we have our session scheduled for today from 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
Ensure you are on time so we can utilize each minute of the session wisely. ☺️
14/11/23, 8:53 am - +263 78 082 7631: 1) Make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
2) The Earn While You Learn Program is a program in which a student is helped to make higher education affordable. A student is given projects and works on them to earn scholarship credits and only by their hard work will they earn more scholarship credits and help them decrease their anual fee. There is no limit to which a student earns scholarship credits as it depends on their hardwork. The annual fee with a scholarship is $3000 and so if a student manages to earn maybe $900 in a year it means their fee is brought down to $2100. That is why the Earn While You Learn program is very beneficial to most students.
3)The Edoofa Scholarship program is designed to help students gain access to quality education. It provides financial support to students who demonstrate academic merit and financial need. Through the program, students can receive funding for tuition, housing, and other educational expenses. The program also offers mentorship and career development opportunities. Overall, the Edoofa Scholarship program aims to help students achieve their educational and career goals.
4)"It’s not every program that manages to make you feel like you are part of something big or very important. That manages to give you an intensive counseling session with your very own personalised counselor, who manages to give you the pros and cons on which university program to undertake. That has your success at priority. The Edoofa program manages all this. It makes you part of a family. l am proud to be part of this family for it has my success at mind." This was said by a Ghanaian student.

The whole team will now ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL program and all your progress will be evaluated regularly so your active participation is very crucial for us to help you.
14/11/23, 10:32 am - +263 78 082 7631: Okay well noted.
14/11/23, 10:35 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I want to provide you with some important information regarding our *PROGRAM STRUCTURE* moving forward. It's crucial that we have a clear understanding of our schedule to ensure effective learning and progress.
14/11/23, 10:37 am - +263 78 082 7631: Okay
14/11/23, 10:38 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Please note that the following schedule will be implemented once we have completed our current phase of learning about all the projects.

For the time being, *Our sessions will be held every day from 8:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. from Monday to Friday*
14/11/23, 10:42 am - +263 78 082 7631: Will you excuse me for Thursday and Friday this week. I might be having lessons at the mentioned times
14/11/23, 10:44 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay Kevin
14/11/23, 10:44 am - Jasmine Edoofa: So, During your EWYL Journey

1. You will be meeting me two days a week. It can be either Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday.
2. You will be getting the lesson of the week, or as we call it *Wednesday Wisdom*, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity which I will share on Saturday.

Now what you learn through the theory of Wednesday wisdom, you will be implementing the same in our Saturday Activities, these will be simple yet testing tasks that you are required to complete. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the *lesson and activity* on the respective days.
14/11/23, 10:48 am - +263 78 082 7631: Okay Noted.
14/11/23, 10:49 am - +263 78 082 7631: Thank you
14/11/23, 10:49 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, Along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you.

15/11/23, 8:32 am - +263 78 082 7631: Yes it is.
15/11/23, 8:32 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, we’re ready to begin your EWYL program, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me.

This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
15/11/23, 8:34 am - +263 78 082 7631: Yes clear
15/11/23, 8:36 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 8:37 am - Jasmine Edoofa: After you are done with the reading, I want you to answer some of my questions to the best of your ability

1. Name all three projects.
2. What do you understand from Project 1?
3. What do you understand from Project 2?
4. What do you understand from Project 3?
15/11/23, 9:17 am - +263 78 082 7631: 1. Project names are Corporate Alliances, Community Building, African Schools Education Reform Mission.
2. Project 1 states that I should reach out to the decision makers in FinTech companies, research about the company and make a list. Also that I should request to connect the decision maker with the seniors at Edoofa and after all those assignments I will get scholarship credits. I have only summarised what I understood. 
3. Project 2 states that I should look for students who have recently graduated or graduated in the last six months, tell them about the Edoofa Scholarship program and connect them with the Edoofa team. Also to mame them apply for the program and once they are in and have made payments is when I will receive the scholarship credits. This is a summary of what I understood again.
4. Project 3 states that I should look for local senior or high schools and make a list of them, connect the decision makers i.e principals with the seniors at Edoofa with a call. This is a way of giving back to the community and schools. After the Edoofa have connected successfully with the calls and enrolled some more students in their program that is when I will earn scholarship credits. Again a summary of what I understood. <This message was edited>

Whereas I am learning to interact with some companies that are technologically driven. The task is to connect witb the companies and tell them about my objectives and how Edoofa is helping me develop the necessary skills needed for employment.

20/11/23, 2:00 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, Let us discuss how we can find suitable companies.
20/11/23, 2:01 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: We can utilize platforms like Google, Instagram, Facebook, and most importantly LinkedIn to assist us in finding suitable companies. 
To proceed, I kindly advise you to create accounts on all these platforms 

Instagram Username:
Facebook Username:
LinkedIn Profile Link:
20/11/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 082 7631: Okay
20/11/23, 2:05 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you have created accounts on these platforms, we can utilize their search features to identify companies that meet our criteria. For instance, on LinkedIn, you can enter "Education" in the search bar after logging in. Similarly, on Google, you can search for terms like "Small-scale educational companies in African countries." This search will display various websites that might contain information about different companies. We can then review these companies and search for the necessary details using LinkedIn and Google.

If you have any questions or need further clarification, please feel free to ask.
20/11/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 082 7631: I have no questions now, but if I do I'll ask
21/11/23, 1:58 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon Kevin
I hope you are in great spirits. 

Are you ready for the session?
21/11/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 082 7631: Yes I am. Sorry for the late reply 
There was no network and I was at a meeting.
21/11/23, 2:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: May I know now if you will be able to participate in the session?
21/11/23, 2:58 pm - +263 78 082 7631: Yes.
23/11/23, 1:31 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Afternoon Kevin*, 
I hope you are doing well. I would like to remind you that you have your session scheduled for today from 1:30 pm onwards. 

*It is almost time for the session,* 
So are you ready?
23/11/23, 1:32 pm - +263 78 082 7631: Yes
23/11/23, 1:34 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 1:34 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Kindly go through the audio that I am sharing below, After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
23/11/23, 1:48 pm - +263 78 082 7631: In the audio you explained that I should make a WhatsApp group so that I will add the ones who have the potential to be Edoofians and study abroad, but before adding them I should get in touch with them in person or on an unofficial group and tell them about the scholarship. If they are willing to study abroad, I add them.
23/11/23, 1:50 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Well Done Kevin, I am impressed with your understanding.
23/11/23, 1:50 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  

Here is the message -
23/11/23, 1:55 pm - +263 78 082 7631: Okay
23/11/23, 1:55 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
