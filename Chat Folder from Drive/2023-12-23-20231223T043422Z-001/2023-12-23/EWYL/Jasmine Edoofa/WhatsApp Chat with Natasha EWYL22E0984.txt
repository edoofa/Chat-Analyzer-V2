29/08/23, 9:59 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning @263778093405 @263773938834 
May I know from when Natasha will be resuming the Earn While You Earn Journey?
30/08/23, 7:09 pm - +263 77 809 3405: Right now, Natasha is at school attending Vacation lessons, she will continue as soon as she is back
31/08/23, 12:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 
I hope you are doing well. Thank you for letting me know. May I know when is she going to come back?
15/09/23, 9:24 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning
I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:36 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
20/09/23, 9:17 am - +263 77 393 8834: Morning Jasmine,
I am Natasha's parent and I really want to appreciate for your concern about the progress of Natasha.We normally face the challenge of network. For now let us as parents assist as you suggested.We can have the initial sessions on the indicated days from  1:30-2:30pm.
Thank you.
22/09/23, 2:29 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 
How are you doing?
05/10/23, 1:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good Afternoon,_*
I hope you are doing well. I would like to tell you that we have been connected for so long but we haven't really finished our introduction. I would kindly suggest you to please connect with me today for 2 hours so that we can move to the next stage. 
Kindly acknowledge and let me know.
06/10/23, 1:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 
May I know that are you available for the session now?
11/10/23, 1:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon,
I hope you are doing well. 

It is time for the session. Are you ready?
12/10/23, 1:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good afternoon,
I trust you're in good health. 

Is it possible for us to commence our session now?
16/10/23, 8:41 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Morning Natasha and Parents* @263778093405 @263773938834 
I trust you're doing well. I'd like to inform you that I understand that you have a lot on your plate with school, but I'd like to extend an invitation to the parents for a session where we will delve into the vision and mission of the EWYL PROGRAM. After this discussion, I'll officially suspend sessions so that the child can concentrate on the upcoming exams. 

I'm wondering if you agree with this plan and if you're available for the sessions today?
18/10/23, 10:55 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Morning @263773938834 @263778093405*
It has been a while since we have connnected and I can see that you have not even replied to my above message. I hope everything is alright. 

I would like to tell you that I understand your child is currently immersed in exam preparations, and I fully appreciate your concerns about avoiding distractions for *Natasha*.  I hope you recall our previous discussion where we intended to conduct an initial orientation session for parents. Unfortunately, due to time contraints, you were unable to follow that.
18/10/23, 10:55 am - Jasmine Edoofa: In light of the circumstances, I am eager to go the extra mile to ensure that *Natasha* remains on par with fellow students. *I'd like to propose scheduling a session with you on Saturday, running from 5:30 pm to 7:30 pm.*
Kindly confirm your availability so that I can arrange the session accordingly.
19/10/23, 7:17 am - +263 77 809 3405: Sorry  for not responding your messages in time because of network problems, noted  thanks
21/10/23, 5:03 pm - +263 77 393 8834: Good evening, I am Rev.Dr.S.Masimbe, Natasha's parent. I am ready for the session.
21/10/23, 5:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening, 
How are you doing?
21/10/23, 5:16 pm - +263 77 393 8834: Fine and you.
21/10/23, 5:17 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am very well. Thank you for asking 😊
May I know if is Natasha in boarding school?
21/10/23, 5:23 pm - +263 77 393 8834: Yes.She is at Loreto High School as a boarder.
21/10/23, 5:25 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay Okay, First of all, Allow me to paint a picture of myself, not just in words, but in actions. Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program, I will be connected even when you are here in India. 

I am a seasoned professional with extensive experience in mentoring students, and I possess a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities that arise when studying overseas.
21/10/23, 5:26 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 5:26 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: In case you face any problems while viewing the video, please let me know.
21/10/23, 5:34 pm - +263 77 393 8834: In the video you indicated that you major in medicine.That is fine and my question is how would you help my daughter in her journey of learning since she is persuing law.
21/10/23, 5:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Certainly, thank you for your question. I'd like to clarify that the "Earn While You Learn" Program isn't directly related to Natasha's academic studies. She will be pursuing a law degree at the university. The EWYL Program is designed to equip students with skills that can enhance their professional careers. These skills include effective communication, leadership qualities, exposure through webinars, and involvement in various projects.

Moreover, the EWYL Program also offers students the opportunity to self-finance their education through specific projects.
21/10/23, 5:46 pm - +263 77 393 8834: Thank you very much for your explanation. Can you give examples of some specific projects that can be undertaken by a law student.
21/10/23, 6:03 pm - +263 77 393 8834: I can't hear from you for some minutes, is this the end of our session.
21/10/23, 6:05 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Certainly, it's important to note that the projects within the EWYL Program are consistent for all students, regardless of their chosen degree. These projects are designed to foster the overall development of your child's personality. We will certainly delve into more details about these projects as we move forward.

Is this arrangement acceptable to you, and can we proceed with our session?
21/10/23, 6:06 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Please excuse me for the delay. My laptop went into reboot
21/10/23, 6:09 pm - +263 77 393 8834: The arrangement is welcome.We can  go ahead with our session.
21/10/23, 6:09 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I hope you did get an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with you.
Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
21/10/23, 6:12 pm - +263 77 393 8834: Here I think I need to be reminded.
21/10/23, 6:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Sure, Let me add to your understanding, that the first goal is to ensure that all Edoofians have an equal opportunity to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a systematic program/curriculum in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Natasha is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach her professional goals.
21/10/23, 6:14 pm - +263 77 393 8834: This is wonderful.
21/10/23, 6:15 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, But this is not it. The second goal is to help all our edoofians self-finance their education, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
21/10/23, 6:22 pm - +263 77 393 8834: Again this is good since it instill discipline in terms of hardworking.Every employer need a hard worker and your program is there to mould students to be industrious.
21/10/23, 6:23 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Indeed
21/10/23, 6:23 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, let me introduce you to the EWYL team. 
Ms.Sanjana is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
21/10/23, 6:24 pm - +263 77 393 8834: Thank you.
21/10/23, 6:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: We also have Ms. Davi, the Head coach with us, and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 

Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
21/10/23, 6:27 pm - +263 77 393 8834: Thank you, once again.I hope we shall co-operate for Natasha to excel in her studies.
21/10/23, 6:27 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes
21/10/23, 6:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates Natasha to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.e. The student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
21/10/23, 6:37 pm - +263 77 393 8834: I hear you but some of these lessons need Natasha herself.I don't know how we can help in coming in her lessons.She is to finish her final exam on the 18th November 2023.There after she will be available and ready for lessons.However, if it is possible for us as parents to chip in and get involved in her lessons, we need your direction.
21/10/23, 6:41 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, once we finish the initial orientation, we will officially pause Natasha's sessions until the 18th of November. Is that arrangement acceptable to you?
21/10/23, 6:42 pm - +263 77 393 8834: Yes, acceptable.
21/10/23, 6:42 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly newsletters as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, Mr. Angad Singh connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once NAME forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
21/10/23, 6:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 6:46 pm - +263 77 393 8834: I am having a scheduled meeting at 7pm this evening and would you allow to end here.
21/10/23, 6:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes sure
21/10/23, 6:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: It was nice talking to you.

23/10/23, 3:51 pm - +263 77 393 8834: It's okay let's arrange for another day.
25/10/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 393 8834: Sorry I was busy now I am free for the session.

21/12/23, 1:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>

21/12/23, 2:55 pm - +263 71 605 0678: 1. Corporate alliance
Community building
African schools education reform mission
2 . Corporate alliance is about representing Edoofa as a proud Edoofian to build a network of partner companies that are going to work together on beneficial projects

2 . Community building is about reaching to those students who have finished their secondary school recently or in the last 6months and refer them to Edoofa so that they will also have opportunities for growth

These different projects help one to acquire certain skills eg 
Corporate alliance helps with networking skills, communication skills and also helps build confidence, same as the African schools education reform mission
Lastly Community building helps in persuasion skills and networking skills , so a lot of different skills are acquired through these projects

22/12/23, 1:26 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am very well. Thank you for asking 😊
22/12/23, 1:26 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: How are you doing dear?
22/12/23, 1:27 pm - +263 71 605 0678: I am also okay

22/12/23, 1:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Today, I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
22/12/23, 1:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/12/23, 1:45 pm - +263 71 605 0678: Ms Jasmine
I have listened to the audio file thrice and its understandable
22/12/23, 1:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
22/12/23, 1:50 pm - +263 71 605 0678: Okay sure
So Corporate alliance helps one to familiarize themselves with the market they are to enter in the future and  during Corporate alliance one has to search for companies which are digital and connect with the employers ,and tell them how Edoofa is helping you out . Getting in touch with these companies will help you get internship and jobs in the country.
22/12/23, 1:52 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Amazing, thanks Natasha. I’m happy with your understanding. So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me! <This message was edited>

To proceed, I kindly advise you to create accounts on all these platforms

22/12/23, 2:27 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you have created accounts on these platforms, we can utilize their search features to identify companies that meet our criteria. For instance, on LinkedIn, you can enter "Education" in the search bar after logging in. Similarly, on Google, you can search for terms like "Small-scale educational companies in African countries." This search will display various websites that might contain information about different companies. We can then review these companies and search for the necessary details using LinkedIn and Google.

If you have any questions or need further clarification, please feel free to ask.

Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for now. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.
In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄
22/12/23, 2:30 pm - +263 71 605 0678: Okay I understand but Project 1 seems to be more fun and interesting
