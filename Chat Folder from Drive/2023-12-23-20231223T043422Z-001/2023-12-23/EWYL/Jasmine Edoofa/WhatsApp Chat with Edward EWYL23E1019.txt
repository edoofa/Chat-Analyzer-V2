15/12/23, 1:53 pm - +263 71 303 5080: 2.Rights and duties are two important concepts that often go hand in hand. Let's start by understanding each of them individually:

1. Rights: Rights are inherent entitlements or privileges that individuals possess by virtue of their existence as human beings, citizens, or members of a particular society. They represent the freedoms and protections that individuals possess, primarily to ensure their well-being, dignity, and autonomy. These rights are often enshrined in laws, constitutions, or international treaties. Examples of rights include the right to life, liberty, and security, freedom of speech, religion, and association, right to a fair trial, and the right to education, among others.

2. Duties: Duties, on the other hand, refer to the responsibilities and obligations individuals have towards society, the government, or their fellow citizens. These duties are often derived from rights and are necessary to maintain social order, harmony, and the functioning of a civil society. Duties can be legally binding or morally expected. They are typically outlined in laws, regulations, or social norms and may include obligations to pay taxes, serve on a jury, adhere to laws, respect the rights of others, and fulfill contractual agreements, among others.

Now, let's discuss the difference between human rights and civil rights:

1. Human Rights: Human rights are fundamental rights that are inherent to all individuals by virtue of their humanity, regardless of their nationality, race, religion, gender, or any other characteristic. Human rights are universal, indivisible, and inalie

19/12/23, 9:01 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Please note that the following schedule will be implemented once we have completed our current phase of learning about all the projects.

For the time being, *Our sessions will be held every day from 8:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. from Monday to Friday*

2. You will be getting the lesson of the week, or as we call it *Wednesday Wisdom*, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity which I will share on Saturday.

Now what you learn through the theory of Wednesday wisdom, you will be implementing the same in our Saturday Activities, these will be simple yet testing tasks that you are required to complete. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the *lesson and activity* on the respective days.

A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now.

20/12/23, 9:08 am - Jasmine Edoofa: You know what Edward, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.

20/12/23, 9:21 am - Jasmine Edoofa: LinkedIn is a professional networking platform designed for individuals to connect with colleagues, peers, and potential employers. It serves as an online resume or professional profile where users can showcase their work experience, skills, education, and achievements
20/12/23, 9:22 am - +263 71 303 5080: Ok  noted
20/12/23, 9:25 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you have created accounts on these platforms, we can utilize their search features to identify companies that meet our criteria. For instance, on LinkedIn, you can enter "Education" in the search bar after logging in. Similarly, on Google, you can search for terms like "Small-scale educational companies in African countries." This search will display various websites that might contain information about different companies. We can then review these companies and search for the necessary details using LinkedIn and Google.

If you have any questions or need further clarification, please feel free to ask.

In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄

_Through WhatsApp community groups_
21/12/23, 9:03 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 9:07 am - +263 71 303 5080: Ok noted

21/12/23, 9:10 am - +263 71 303 5080: I have to create a WhatsApp group that l put people who have finished their Alevel and  this who have already passed their Alevel  a give them a tour into the edoofa program  but to note you my mentor should be ther in the group to monitor me
21/12/23, 9:11 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Well Done Edward, I am impressed with your understanding.
21/12/23, 9:11 am - Jasmine Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
21/12/23, 9:12 am - +263 71 303 5080: Ok

22/12/23, 8:52 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
