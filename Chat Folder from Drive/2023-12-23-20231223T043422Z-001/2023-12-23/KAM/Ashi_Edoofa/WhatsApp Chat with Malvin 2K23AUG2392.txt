If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
02/09/23, 10:03 am - +263 71 564 0809: Yes we can 🌟
02/09/23, 10:03 am - +263 71 564 0809: We can Start
02/09/23, 10:05 am - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/09/23, 11:15 am - +263 71 564 0809: I'm done
02/09/23, 12:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
02/09/23, 12:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
02/09/23, 12:22 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Okay so I have to type that one
02/09/23, 12:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263715640809, no we will be assisting you here as well Also please note that this is just a brief understanding of what your admission process holds, you will be explained each and every step in detail as we move forward, I would appreciate you being patient, please.

Now if we are clear shall we move ahead?
02/09/23, 12:29 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Yes we are clear
02/09/23, 12:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
02/09/23, 12:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
02/09/23, 1:03 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Okay
02/09/23, 1:04 pm - +263 71 564 0809: I am following
02/09/23, 1:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
02/09/23, 1:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
02/09/23, 2:52 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Okay , yes it is clear
04/09/23, 11:54 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Malvin.

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
04/09/23, 9:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
04/09/23, 9:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
04/09/23, 10:01 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Yes that's exactly what I understood
04/09/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
04/09/23, 10:53 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Yes
05/09/23, 9:47 am - +263 71 564 0809: Good morning Ms Kirti

09/09/23, 5:59 am - +263 71 564 0809: No I want this year's intake
09/09/23, 6:01 am - +263 71 564 0809: Latest will be November
09/09/23, 10:45 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Malvin.

I hope you are doing well, Thank you for letting me know that, and kindly excuse me for the delay in response, as I was having a discussion about the same with the Academic Board, for you and let me inform you that since Bachelor of Pharmacy is Niche course, and if you want to take admission in this year Intake, we only have October intake 2023, and for that you will have to be very proactive with the coming process.
09/09/23, 10:46 am - Kirti Edoofa: Let me also help you understand, that the entire admission process to complete will take 10 days if you are financially prepared. 

So I would like to have a confirmation from your side, that you are mentally and financially prepared for your admission fee and travel expenses from Zimbabwe to India, if you want an October 2023 intake?
09/09/23, 11:24 am - +263 71 564 0809: Yes I am ready
09/09/23, 11:28 am - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, in that case, please write a mail to "*academicboard@edoofa.com*" stating that you had a discussion with your admission officer about changing your year of intake from August 2024 to October 2023 and that you are choosing to do that because after having a family discussion and your family also supports you in that. So, you are requesting the academic board to change your year of intake. Please also mention the admission group name in the mail and once you are done sending the mail kindly update me here also with the screenshot. 

I hope we are clear here?
09/09/23, 11:39 am - +263 71 564 0809: Okay
09/09/23, 12:00 pm - +263 71 564 0809: How much will it be in total
09/09/23, 12:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand that better, To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelor of Pharmacy for your higher education in India as per the October 2023 intake?
09/09/23, 12:02 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Yes
09/09/23, 12:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
09/09/23, 12:05 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Can you please tell me how much the it will be in total
09/09/23, 12:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263715640809 I would please like you to be patient, as we are going to discuss that now only step by step.
09/09/23, 12:37 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Okay
09/09/23, 12:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
09/09/23, 12:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
09/09/23, 12:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
09/09/23, 12:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
09/09/23, 12:59 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Yes that's right
11/09/23, 3:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Malvin.

I hope you are doing well, and had a great weekend, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
11/09/23, 3:04 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Good afternoon Ms Kirti yes I'm available
11/09/23, 3:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know, may I know if you are clear here?
11/09/23, 3:06 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Yes its clear
11/09/23, 3:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
11/09/23, 3:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
11/09/23, 3:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
11/09/23, 4:00 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Correct
11/09/23, 4:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
11/09/23, 4:06 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Yes we are
11/09/23, 9:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
11/09/23, 9:38 pm - +263 71 564 0809: I did
11/09/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example
11/09/23, 9:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
11/09/23, 10:12 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Okay so $1025 is to be paid within the 3 days of arrival?
11/09/23, 10:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, indeed, let me help you understand. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
11/09/23, 10:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
11/09/23, 10:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
11/09/23, 10:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
12/09/23, 12:41 am - +263 71 564 0809: Currently we are going through some issues at home may kindly know by when the money will be needed because something beyond our control came up
12/09/23, 4:00 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Good afternoon I am available now
12/09/23, 4:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, now coming to your concern, could you please help me know what the issue you are facing since the cost breakdown has been explained to you in detail now along with the traveling expenses and Visa, That is all the cost that is needed please.
12/09/23, 4:07 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Currently there has been an emergency at home which stretched into the school budget so currently the tuition fee is short so if the intake could be moved a bit so that we can get time to gather the funds once again
12/09/23, 4:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, however, could you please let me know what challenges are you facing, you wanted October 2023, intake in the first place, and you clearly mentioned that you are ready, so please I would like to understand, how is that you are planning for Malvin's higher education and what happened all of a sudden as informed you earlier, Pharmacy is a Niche course so after October admission will be difficult for this year's intake.

I hope you understand?
12/09/23, 7:03 pm - +263 77 294 9098: Good day Ms kirti,i am really sorry to change last minute like malvin has js stated we have a problem at home but i really wanted him to get this year's intake but if there's any intake early next year if its possible we can gladly take that its just that the situation is beyond our control and sorry for the inconveniences caused

13/09/23, 1:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263772949098 as per our records you were originally enrolled for August 2024, intake only, however, because you wanted to arrive in this year intake I had a discussion with the Academic Board for that, and now you are saying that you want AUgust 2024 intake, I hope I am understanding right?
13/09/23, 1:49 pm - +263 77 294 9098: Yes
13/09/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In that case, you would have to write a mail again please to "*academicboard@edoofa.com*" stating that you had a discussion with your admission officer about changing your year of intake from October 2023 to August 2024 and that you are choosing to do that because after having a family discussion and due to some problems at home. So, you are requesting the academic board to change your year of intake again. Please also mention the admission group name in the mail and once you are done sending the mail kindly update me here also with the screenshot. 

I hope we are clear here?
13/09/23, 1:55 pm - +263 77 294 9098: Yes thank you
13/09/23, 1:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall wait for your response for the screenshot.

13/09/23, 8:51 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Good evening,  yes we are

13/09/23, 9:00 pm - +263 71 564 0809: <Media omitted>
13/09/23, 9:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the screenshot, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
13/09/23, 9:05 pm - +263 71 564 0809: I am ava
13/09/23, 9:05 pm - +263 71 564 0809: *available
13/09/23, 9:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great Now I believe you have had a discussion with your family regarding your admission process, so I would like to know if you have any queries or concerns to share?
13/09/23, 9:11 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Currently we have no queries
13/09/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
13/09/23, 9:13 pm - +263 71 564 0809: I haven't
13/09/23, 9:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand @263715640809 , it is alright, let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.

For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
13/09/23, 9:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
13/09/23, 9:19 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Yes it will help
13/09/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing to hear that, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
13/09/23, 9:25 pm - +263 71 564 0809: I do , but getting the money early this side is impossible the money will be available early next year
13/09/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: yes, please I understand, however The early decision benefits are different since they provide more benefits as we discuss ahead you will understand, Shall we now move forward?
13/09/23, 9:28 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Yes
13/09/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
13/09/23, 9:36 pm - +263 71 564 0809: No I wasn't
13/09/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:

1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.

3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
13/09/23, 9:38 pm - +263 71 564 0809: okay
13/09/23, 9:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
13/09/23, 9:43 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Okay
13/09/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them. Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
13/09/23, 9:45 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Yes we are
13/09/23, 9:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Each year the universities revise their fee structure and it is highly possible that the fee would be increased for the academic year 2024. Over the past few years, we have seen a hike of 20%-30% in the tuition fee and to help our students from the same, students have been given the opportunity to keep their fee structure as per the current academic year of 2023.
13/09/23, 9:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here, if you make the early decision to start with your university admission process and decide to reserve your seat with the university earlier, you will be able to get the above-mentioned early decision benefit and this would help you keep your fee structure the same for the complete course of your bachelor’s education in India.
13/09/23, 10:11 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Yes please
13/09/23, 10:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. Here, when you receive the Letter of Intent (Offer Letter) from the university, the registration fee would be mentioned, so by the grant of $150 means, if your registration fee is $750, then the actual registration fee that you have to pay will be only $600. 

Once the payment of $600 is made by you, the complete amount of $750 will be adjusted against your first-year university fee since we will be paying the $150 to the university on your behalf. Have you understood?
13/09/23, 10:15 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Yes I have understood
13/09/23, 10:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. If your finances aren't prepared, and you need some time, in such cases, *Edoofa* is giving an option to make the payment of the Registration fee in 2 parts, the first part i.e. 50% of the registration fee after the grant of $150, has to be paid within the time period mentioned by the university and the second part i.e. the remaining 50% of the registration fee has to be paid within 30 days from the first deadline date. 

For example, if your deadline is 30th August 2023, and your registration fee after the grant is $600, then you have to pay $300 on or before 30th August 2023, and the remaining $300 has to be paid by 30th September 2023. Any queries so far?
13/09/23, 10:17 pm - +263 71 564 0809: No we are clear on that
13/09/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through all 4 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 4 points clear?
13/09/23, 10:19 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Yes they are clear
13/09/23, 10:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, now may I know if your parents are available to connect with us?
13/09/23, 10:20 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Currently she is not she will be available tomorrow morning
13/09/23, 10:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, in that case, I would like you to take some time and have a discussion with your parents concerning the next steps in your university admission journey and update them about the benefits of the early decision. I am sure they would be excited and open to the same opportunity.
13/09/23, 10:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: We will reconnect tomorrow at the same time, I hope you and your parents will be available.
13/09/23, 10:23 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Okay thank you I'll discuss with her,tomorrow we'll be available have a good night
14/09/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Malvin.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
14/09/23, 10:51 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Good evening yes I am available
15/09/23, 2:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents Malvin.

I hope you are doing well, by the time you responded it was past our available hours, so we were unable to get back to you, so may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
15/09/23, 3:39 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Good afternoon,  I am available
15/09/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 294 9098: Good afternoon yes we are available
15/09/23, 8:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, kindly excuse me for the delay in response, as I was attending a meeting may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
15/09/23, 8:56 pm - +263 77 294 9098: Its ok, Good day i am available
15/09/23, 8:57 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Good day I am available
15/09/23, 9:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, I hope you were able to have a discussion as a family by now so I'm interested in knowing how the discussion went regarding the advantages of early decision benefits, as we discussed previously?
15/09/23, 9:49 pm - +263 71 564 0809: It went well , we are so excited to be part of this programme. They are giving full support on this one
15/09/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now before we move forward and have a conversation regarding the same, may I know if your parents are available with us for this session and if they have any queries that you would like to ask or any concerns that have been bothering you and you would like to share?
15/09/23, 9:54 pm - +263 71 564 0809: She is available just having trouble with network, she says she has no concerns
15/09/23, 9:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Great! It is good to know all of us are on the same page. I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.*
15/09/23, 9:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due date will be mentioned
15/09/23, 9:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?*
15/09/23, 10:00 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Okay
15/09/23, 10:00 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Okay
15/09/23, 10:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
15/09/23, 10:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
15/09/23, 10:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
15/09/23, 10:02 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Yes we are
15/09/23, 10:05 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Yes we are clear
15/09/23, 10:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Now you have two ways to proceed with your child’s university admission process -

*1. Proceed as per the standard procedures*
*2. Proceed with the Early Decision Benefits*

Be assured that I will help you understand the difference between both of them so that you can make a well-informed decision regarding your child’s university admission process. Shall we start with our discussion regarding the same?
15/09/23, 10:16 pm - +263 71 564 0809: 2 will be okay
15/09/23, 10:17 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Proceed with the Early Decision Benefits
15/09/23, 10:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that @263715640809, however, let us discuss both the process for your understanding as well.
15/09/23, 10:19 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Okay
15/09/23, 10:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: let us start with the *Standard Registration/University Admission process*-

As you are aware that one’s registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university, to be on the safer side, let us assume that the registration fee is $750 itself.

As per the standard procedures, once you get the offer letter from the university, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of $750.

For example, if you get the offer letter on the 16th of September and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, the deadline for the registration fee would be the 01st of October 2023 and you would have to make the payment of the fee before then. Are you clear about this?
15/09/23, 10:23 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Yes we are
15/09/23, 10:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: now let us discuss the *Early Registration/University Admission process -*

As the name states, a student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.

If you do that, you are eligible for all 6 benefits that we discussed earlier. Since the benefit number 3 and 4 helps you ease the registration process, I will be discussing the same in particular and help you understand how that happens -

When we talk about the Early Decision Grant of $150 (benefit number 3)
15/09/23, 10:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To understand the same, let us once again assume that the registration fee due is $750 and if you have a grant of $150, this means that out of the fee due of $750, $150 will be paid by the Edoofa Academic Board on your behalf and hence this leaves your child’s fee due as $750 - $150 = $600.

So, the amount that you will have to pay to reserve/lock your child’s scholarship seat becomes $600.
15/09/23, 10:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

1. The first part ~ $300 is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 16th of September, the deadline becomes the 01st of October, 2023)

2. The second part ~ $300 is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 16th of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 01st of October 2023, making the second deadline the 01st of November, 2023).

Please let me know if we are on the same page here as well?
15/09/23, 10:32 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Yes we are on the same page
15/09/23, 10:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
15/09/23, 10:38 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Yes they are very clear
15/09/23, 10:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, now before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
15/09/23, 10:43 pm - +263 71 564 0809: The admission process will start when my parent is financially and mentally ready, I can early registration admission process  or the standard registration admission process,  with early admission i can pay half within 15 days and the other half within 30days
15/09/23, 10:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days. 

4. With the standard admission process, as a student you are not paying any more fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until your parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with your admission process.

Please let me know if you are clear on this?
15/09/23, 10:56 pm - +263 71 564 0809: We are clear
15/09/23, 10:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
15/09/23, 10:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Monday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.

When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *01st October* and *01st November*.
15/09/23, 10:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, If you as parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines ( *01st of October and 01st of November*), you can give us the go-ahead so that we can prepare Malvin's application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
15/09/23, 11:00 pm - +263 71 564 0809: You have my full consent as the parent i give you the go ahead
15/09/23, 11:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have given us the go-ahead to move forward with Malvin's university admission process, I believe you are financially confident that you will be able to manage the registration fee in due time by ( *01st of October and 01st of November*) and are mentally prepared for the next steps?
16/09/23, 7:30 am - +263 77 294 9098: Yes i am ready
16/09/23, 8:51 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Malvin.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for letting me know that. Alright please, as you have given us the go-ahead, let us proceed towards preparing Malvin's application and forward it to the universities, applicable for the course and suggested by the academic board. Once we get an update from the universities, we will reconnect with you and share the same updates with you. In the meantime, if and when you have any queries, feel free to bring them forward so that we can address them and help you plan for Malvin's higher education well.
16/09/23, 7:06 pm - +263 77 294 9098: Ok thank you
22/09/23, 10:51 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Malvin!
I hope you all are doing well. 

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa, and today, I have some incredible news to share with you all! After you gave the admissions team the green light to proceed with your university application process, the team worked on processing your application accordingly. And, I'm thrilled to inform you that the university application process has been a success and you have received a prestigious offer from MVN University, along with a remarkable 75% scholarship! Congratulations on this incredible achievement. 🌟✨🎓
22/09/23, 10:51 am - Milan Edoofa: The University will be mailing you the letter shortly, since we received the letter early, we are sharing it with you here. Take your time to review the letter and then once you are done going through it, we will then have a discussion about the letter in detail and address any questions or concerns you may have. Congratulations on this prestigious offer and securing a 75% scholarship! Your hard work has truly paid off! ⭐🌟
22/09/23, 10:51 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/09/23, 11:37 am - +263 71 564 0809: Good Afternoon how are you okay let us look into it
22/09/23, 2:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, may I know if you are done going through the letter please?
22/09/23, 2:35 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Yes I am done
22/09/23, 2:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Glad to hear that please. I would be discussing the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have, and to commence our letter discussion,  I would like to confirm the details mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University.
22/09/23, 2:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Hence, could you please take a moment to review your letter again and provide me with the following information:

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is your annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
22/09/23, 2:48 pm - +263 71 564 0809: 1. $1000
2.$0
3.$2250
4.$125
5.$1000
22/09/23, 4:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per your offer letter, MVN University has awarded you a 75% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you will only have to pay 25% of the per annum tuition fee for your course at MVN University, i.e. $1000.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in your letter, you have also been awarded a 100% waiver on your accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided to you will be free of cost throughout your stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making your education more affordable, isn’t it? <This message was edited>
22/09/23, 4:17 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Yes it is
22/09/23, 4:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as you can see in your offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $1000
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
22/09/23, 4:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you would be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $2250.

Now, for the first year, you can see that there are two components that are one-time payable i.e. Sports Fee and Misc. Fee, so your total expenses for the first year become $2250 + $250 = $2500.

Please note that this cost is only for the first year, and from the second year onwards, your per annum cost of education will be $2250. I hope you are clear about that?
22/09/23, 4:31 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Yes it's clear
22/09/23, 4:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, Now that you are aware of your per annum fee, let me tell you what all facilities are offered by the universities and are covered as per the university's fee structure -

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Exmanitaion Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.

I hope you are clear with this?
22/09/23, 4:41 pm - +263 71 564 0809: If number 6 is covered by university fees structure then why do I have to pay the $300
24/09/23, 7:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Malvin!
I hope you are doing well today.
24/09/23, 8:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please I understand that, however, I believe you do have a misunderstanding here. The $300 that you will pay will contribute towards the International Student Development Fund Fee and that is why it is included in the per annum costs. Now, by saying that it is covered in the university's fee structure, we mean that once the fee is cleared, then these facilities will be made available to the students. I hope you are clear about that now?
25/09/23, 10:17 am - +263 71 564 0809: Yes it is clear now
26/09/23, 7:40 am - +263 71 564 0809: Good morning
26/09/23, 10:44 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Malvin!
I hope you are doing well today.
26/09/23, 10:44 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that please. Now, may I know if you are clear till here so that we can proceed with our conversation?
26/09/23, 11:32 am - +263 71 564 0809: Yes let us proceed
26/09/23, 3:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, students under the Edoofa Program have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
26/09/23, 3:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
26/09/23, 4:18 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Yes we are clear
26/09/23, 4:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum education costs of $2250 and so the balance fee becomes $2250 - $1000 = $1250 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
26/09/23, 4:27 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Yes the EWYL program was explained very well
26/09/23, 4:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, as informed, the admission and processing fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter will be adjusted against your first year’s expenses of $2250, therefore the amount of fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $2250 - $1000 = $1250.

I hope you are clear about this as well?
26/09/23, 4:28 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Yes it is clear
26/09/23, 4:29 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Are we settling for this offer? Or there are still others coming so I can compare
27/09/23, 10:19 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Malvin!
I hope you are doing well today.
27/09/23, 10:19 am - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
27/09/23, 10:19 am - Milan Edoofa: Stay assured that I will help you with this query of yours shortly during the end of our discussion here. Before that, can you please let me know if you are clear till here please?
27/09/23, 11:00 am - +263 71 564 0809: Yes we are clear
27/09/23, 11:48 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $1000 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
27/09/23, 11:48 am - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$425 before 06th October 2023.*
2. *$425 before 06th November 2023.*
27/09/23, 11:48 am - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $850 within 15 working days by *06th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
27/09/23, 12:24 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Yes we are
27/09/23, 3:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due. The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
27/09/23, 3:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
27/09/23, 4:27 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Yes
27/09/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you are planning to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
27/09/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
27/09/23, 4:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
27/09/23, 4:39 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Okay but I'm not planning to pay to this one yet I need more options so I can choose. From the pictures I saw I was not pleased with this university and its rating is low
28/09/23, 10:05 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Malvin!
I hope you are doing well today.
28/09/23, 10:05 am - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
28/09/23, 10:06 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me here dear. Now, on that note Malvin, can you please first let me know about how is it that you were able to conclude that the ranking of MVN University is low and that it is not a good university dear?
28/09/23, 1:39 pm - +263 71 564 0809: <Media omitted>
28/09/23, 1:43 pm - +263 71 564 0809: I would really appreciate it if you could get me admission at Lovely professional University
28/09/23, 1:55 pm - +263 71 564 0809: <Media omitted>
28/09/23, 2:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here Malvin. Now, on that note, can you please also help me in understanding about where did you look for there rankings please?
28/09/23, 4:24 pm - +263 71 564 0809: On the Internet and I asked my peers there India
28/09/23, 4:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for providing more information, Malvin. I understand that you have concerns about the ranking of MVN University and that you've gathered information from various sources, including the internet and peers in India.
28/09/23, 4:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: I want to clarify that while online rankings can provide some insights, they may not always reflect the complete picture. Rankings can vary depending on the criteria used by different organizations, and sometimes they may not accurately represent the quality of education and opportunities offered by a university.

In the case of MVN University, it is important to note that it is recognized by the University Grants Commission (UGC), which is the regulatory body for higher education in India. Additionally, the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) is a reputable ranking body in India, and MVN University is among the top 100 universities according to NIRF. This is a significant achievement and demonstrates the university's commitment to academic excellence. I hope you are clear with this? <This message was edited>
28/09/23, 5:13 pm - +263 71 564 0809: It is very clear thank you but we are not settling for MVN University
29/09/23, 10:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Malvin!
I hope you are doing well today.
29/09/23, 10:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, thank you for letting me know of that. However, can you please help me in understanding about the reason that you are having such a thought on MVN University>?
29/09/23, 10:25 am - +263 71 564 0809: This decision is based on the research I've done
03/10/23, 1:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Malvin!
I hope you are doing well today.
03/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since it was a long weekend and the team was not available. I appreciate your patience here.
03/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, thank you for letting me know of the same here dear. On that note, I appreciate that you have taken this decision on the basis of the research that you have done. Moving ahead, you can stay assured that we have shared your application with a few of our partner universiteis as well, and we are expecting a response from their side, however, since this offer letter was the first one that you have received, that is what we had shared here with you. 

On that note, since you already have the deadline date for the offer letter that you have received, in that case, if you wish to let go of this letter, you can surely do that, but I just wanted to inform you that once this offer letter will be revoked, you won't be able to get admission to that university again. I hope this is clear?
03/10/23, 4:23 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Okay
03/10/23, 4:23 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Yes it is clear thank you
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Malvin!
I hope you are doing well today.
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, on that note, since we are already awaiting a response for your appilcation that we had shared with the other universities, may I know if you are certain that you wish to let go of the scholarship offer that you have received from MVN University please?
06/10/23, 3:33 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Good afternoon
06/10/23, 3:33 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Yes I am certain
09/10/23, 8:28 am - Milan Edoofa: This message was deleted
09/10/23, 8:44 am - +263 71 564 0809: Good morning
09/10/23, 7:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Malvin!
I hope you are doing well today.
09/10/23, 7:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, dear, in that case, once we receive an update from the side of the university about the same, we will let you know.
09/10/23, 7:53 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Okay thank you
16/10/23, 11:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Malvin!

Congratulations on this prestigious offer and securing a scholarship!
16/10/23, 11:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/10/23, 9:27 am - +263 71 564 0809: Thank you so much
17/10/23, 9:28 am - +263 71 564 0809: Okay thank you 😊
17/10/23, 3:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Malvin!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 3:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Were you able to take your time to go through the offer letter that I had shared here in detail and are you available to discuss that in detail?
17/10/23, 3:51 pm - +263 77 294 9098: Good afternoon we are still discussing bt i think malvin loves the offer so we will update you tonight after we have finalize our discussion
17/10/23, 4:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. However, to provide you with a better clarity on the offer letter, shall we discuss that here?
17/10/23, 5:14 pm - +263 77 294 9098: Sure
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and MAlvin!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, can you please let me know if you were able to go through the offer letter from LPU by now?
18/10/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 294 9098: Good day yes we have
18/10/23, 1:42 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Good afternoon,  Yes we have
18/10/23, 4:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 4-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 8 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $1475 making your per annum tuition fee ($1475*2) = $2950. Is that clear?
18/10/23, 5:52 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Yes it is clear
18/10/23, 9:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -
18/10/23, 9:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
18/10/23, 9:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
19/10/23, 8:39 am - +263 71 564 0809: Oh okay
19/10/23, 9:03 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Malvin!
I hope you are doing well today.
19/10/23, 9:03 am - Milan Edoofa: Malvin, may I know if you are clear till here so that we can move ahead with our discussion here and proceed with the next steps in your admission journey?
19/10/23, 9:06 am - +263 71 564 0809: Good morning
19/10/23, 9:06 am - +263 71 564 0809: Yes it is clear
19/10/23, 9:07 am - Milan Edoofa: If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
19/10/23, 9:07 am - Milan Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?
19/10/23, 9:39 am - +263 71 564 0809: Yes it is clear
19/10/23, 9:40 am - Milan Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
19/10/23, 9:40 am - +263 71 564 0809: Yes it is clear
19/10/23, 9:43 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $700 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
19/10/23, 9:43 am - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$275 before 31st October 2023.*
2. *$275 before 30th November 2023.*
19/10/23, 9:43 am - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $550 within 15 working days by *31st October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page. <This message was edited>
19/10/23, 9:44 am - +263 71 564 0809: Yes I do
19/10/23, 9:44 am - +263 71 564 0809: Yes we are clear
19/10/23, 9:44 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
19/10/23, 9:44 am - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
19/10/23, 9:47 am - +263 71 564 0809: Yes I'm in Harare
19/10/23, 9:48 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this with me. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
19/10/23, 9:48 am - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
19/10/23, 9:48 am - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
19/10/23, 9:49 am - +263 71 564 0809: Okay thank you
19/10/23, 9:52 am - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
19/10/23, 9:54 am - +263 71 564 0809: I'll use Mr Rajan
19/10/23, 9:57 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please dear, you can do that. Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your edsucation more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
19/10/23, 9:57 am - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
19/10/23, 9:58 am - +263 71 564 0809: Yes we are
19/10/23, 10:00 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
19/10/23, 10:02 am - +263 71 564 0809: The 700 was said to be adjusted with the fees for the first semester I did not see you mention it ,is it still valid
19/10/23, 10:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear. On that note, I would like to mention that once paid, the registration fee of $700 will be adjusted in your first year fee, thereby reducing the same. Let me explain it to you here as well. 

First Semester Fee: $1475 
Registration Fee: $700
Balance to be paid after registration: $1475 - $700 = $775

May I know if that is clear now?
19/10/23, 10:07 am - +263 71 564 0809: Yes it is clear
19/10/23, 10:08 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, may I know if you have any other queries that you wish to ask please?
19/10/23, 10:12 am - +263 71 564 0809: For now no
19/10/23, 10:13 am - +263 71 564 0809: Oh sorry so about the accommodation I'll choose whether to stay on campus or off campus when I get to India or I choose when I'm here
19/10/23, 10:14 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, you will choose that when you will arrive here in India.
19/10/23, 10:21 am - +263 71 564 0809: Okay there are no further questions thank you
19/10/23, 10:22 am - Milan Edoofa: Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -
19/10/23, 10:22 am - Milan Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable. 

It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.

The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/

19/10/23, 10:52 am - +263 71 564 0809: Oh wow its nice
19/10/23, 10:55 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, I would also encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter from LPU with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by one of the top Indian universities and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on them by tomorrow and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.
19/10/23, 3:09 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Okay
20/10/23, 2:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Malvin!
I hope you are doing well.

Following our earlier conversation, I believe you and your family must be very excited about the opportunity you have received from MVN University. Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion, and I can only imagine the enthusiasm that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.

Moving ahead, have you had the chance to discuss the offer letter from MVN University as a family yet?
20/10/23, 3:44 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Yes
20/10/23, 3:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I'm confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I'm curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
20/10/23, 5:19 pm - +263 71 564 0809: They are really excited about this opportunity and with the aid of the research they are in full support
20/10/23, 5:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm glad to see that your family is so pleased with the offer letter, and it's wonderful to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I'd like to ask if you would like me to address any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
20/10/23, 5:20 pm - +263 71 564 0809: We are ready to pay the admission fee
20/10/23, 5:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: That's great to hear. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of the admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. I'm here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
20/10/23, 5:21 pm - +263 71 564 0809: For now there are no questions
20/10/23, 5:21 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Yes I did i really liked the virtual tour it was a fulfilling experience
20/10/23, 5:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: That's fantastic to hear! As you explore this opportunity further, I’m sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat.

Now, since the university has given you a date of 29th October to complete the registration process, you have two options to do that, one is a $425 payment, and the other is a single payment of $850. Have you had a chance to consider which payment plan you'd like to proceed with?
20/10/23, 5:49 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Am not supposed to pay $550 for admission
20/10/23, 8:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Oh, excuse me for the confusion dear. Yes, please you are right. Now, since the university has given you a date of 31st October to complete the registration process, you have two options to do that, one is a $275 payment, and the other is a single payment of $550. Have you had a chance to consider which payment plan you'd like to proceed with?
20/10/23, 10:12 pm - +263 71 564 0809: We have opted for the single payment
20/10/23, 10:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of this. In addition, it would be great if you could kindly provide me with the specific date you have in mind for the payment and the mode of payment that you are planning to use so that I can share the same information with the university officials as well.
20/10/23, 10:29 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Tomorrow or Sunday
20/10/23, 10:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me. As you navigate through your admission journey, please remember that if you encounter any challenges or have any concerns that could potentially hinder your progress, do not hesitate to reach out to me here. I trust that you will keep this in mind and feel comfortable reaching out when needed, right?
20/10/23, 10:31 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Okay my counsellor thank you
20/10/23, 10:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: I appreciate you for keeping me informed. I will also ensure that the university officials are updated on our progress.

With your sessions now completed, and the offer letter in your possession, your next important step is to ensure the payment of your university registration fee within the shared deadline to secure your scholarship seat.
20/10/23, 10:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Once you've made the payment, please share the receipt with me here. This will enable me to promptly confirm the transaction with our accounts team and notify the university officials. Remember, I’m here to assist you, so please don't hesitate to reach out if you require any support or guidance during this process. 

Wishing you a wonderful day ahead!
20/10/23, 10:33 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Okay
20/10/23, 10:34 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Thank you Milan ,very much appreciated 🙏

I trust this message finds you in good health. I am Ms. Ashi, the Admission Officer at Edoofa. I am pleased to inform you that the payment of your registration fee has been confirmed by the accounts team and we have updated the university officials on the same.

As per the updates we have from the admissions team, they are hopeful to get updates from Lovely Professional University as well for your application, we are waiting for the same so that you have another scholarship offer and you can make a well-informed decision for your higher education and then the university will process your provisional admission acceptance letter.

I trust that you and your family are doing well today. I am pleased to connect with you today to share some positive updates with you.
22/12/23, 9:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In light of your admission process, As we have shared that one of our partnered universities, Lovely Professional University (LPU), which is among the top 100 universities in India, has been considering your application for the scholarship opportunity. They have mentioned that they would be able to give us an update by the month of January, considering the high volume of applications they have received in the past two months (more than 2000 applications).
22/12/23, 9:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In addition to this, the academic board also mentioned that there are a few more universities willing to put your application in consideration for scholarship opportunities in the month of January. Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter. This approach allows you to have multiple scholarship options, giving you the flexibility to decide on the university for your education in India and then carry out your visa application process the right way.
22/12/23, 9:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this update, I also want to inform you that since we are waiting for updates from the universities, we will be holding our conversation until 20th January and will reconnect around the same time. Until then, we wanted to share these updates with you so that you are well-informed about the process and know what lies ahead. We are thrilled to be a part of this new chapter in your academic journey.
22/12/23, 9:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, now that you are done with your admission process, you are encouraged to channel your energy and focus on your Earn While You Learn (EWYL) journey so that you can maximize the benefits from it. May this period be filled with meaningful learning, personal growth, and amazing opportunities. 

If you are not connected with your EWYL Mentor or if you have any queries/concerns related to your admission journey, please feel free to reach out to us and we will do our best to assist you!
22/12/23, 9:14 pm - +263 71 564 0809: If I get another offer and decide to settle for it does it mean I have to pay enrolment fee agaim
22/12/23, 9:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you here -

Once you gave the team a go-ahead to proceed with your university admission process, your application was shared with multiple universities which were applicable to your course and were recommended by the Academic Board. Lovely Professional University is one of those universities and they are currently evaluating your application, and if they decide to offer a scholarship to you, they will send you an offer letter.
22/12/23, 9:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: After getting another offer letter, if you decide to change your university to LPU from the current university, you will be able to do the same without paying any additional amount of money. Are you clear on this?
22/12/23, 9:17 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Okay that is clear so if I choose to change they will also take time to evaluate?
22/12/23, 9:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please excuse me I am not able to understand your query, could you please elaborate?
22/12/23, 9:20 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Getting an offer letter and getting an acceptance letter are 2 different things right
22/12/23, 9:20 pm - +263 71 564 0809: Right now I'm waiting for an acceptance letter from LPU right?
22/12/23, 9:21 pm - +263 71 564 0809: So if I get another offer letter and I choose to change from LPU to that university I'm not paying the registration fee but I'll have to wait for the acceptance letter?
22/12/23, 9:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, you are right that the offer letter and acceptance letter are two different letter. We are waiting for the offer letter from LPU, however if you get the better opportunity you can change your university without paying any additional money.
22/12/23, 11:02 pm - +263 71 564 0809: To be clear this is not the offer letter?
22/12/23, 11:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This the offer letter from Lovely Professional University and you have completed the registration process with the university. Your scholarship seat is reserved with the university <This message was edited>
