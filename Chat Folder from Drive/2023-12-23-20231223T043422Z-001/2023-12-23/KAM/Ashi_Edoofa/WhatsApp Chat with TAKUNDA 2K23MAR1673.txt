I hope this message finds you well. I am *Mr. Shivjeet, Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As per our commitment, following the successful closure of the 2023 intake, I am delighted to inform you that we are now fully prepared to commence the university application process for your higher studies, targeting the intake of 2024. 

Before we embark on your admission journey, I'd like to inquire about your well-being and that of your family. How have the past few months been for you and your family?
06/09/23, 3:50 pm - +263 78 411 9566: Afternoon how are you. Well I have been doing well for the past days and the same goes to my family. These past months were hectic since we were reading and studying to improve my grades but never the less it was okay and good
06/09/23, 4:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm delighted to hear that you and your family are doing well. It's wonderful to know that you've been keeping in good health and high spirits. 

As we come to the conclusion of the 2023 intake, I'm excited to provide you with a glimpse of our Proud Edoofians.

04/10/23, 2:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
04/10/23, 2:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon. I hope you are doing well and blessed.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you earlier as it was the weekend, followed by a national holiday on Monday, which was Gandhi Jayanti. Allow me to provide you with a little knowledge about it as well. Gandhi Jayanti is an annual national holiday in India celebrated on October 2nd to commemorate the birthday of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi. He was a prominent leader in the Indian independence movement against British rule and a proponent of nonviolent civil disobedience as a means of achieving political and social change.

Now that being said, I am happy to inform you that I am now available for the session. May I inquire if you are currently available to proceed further with the session?

05/10/23, 8:49 am - +263 78 411 9566: Yes I am

05/10/23, 4:03 pm - +263 71 578 8111: Yes we are ready
05/10/23, 4:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's wonderful to hear, and I'm thrilled to know you're ready to kickstart your admission process. Your commitment to this journey is greatly appreciated. 

Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Agriculture) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
05/10/23, 4:36 pm - +263 71 578 8111: Yes true
05/10/23, 5:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Along with that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

Wishing you a great week ahead, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
09/10/23, 2:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and My dear student. 

I trust you had a restful weekend with your family. May I kindly inquire if you are presently available to continue with our session?
09/10/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 411 9566: Good afternoon to you, yes I am ready
09/10/23, 3:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/10/23, 3:56 pm - +263 78 411 9566: I sorry for the late response I had to attend a lesson
09/10/23, 3:57 pm - +263 78 411 9566: Yes I very much remember
09/10/23, 4:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
10/10/23, 2:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed. May I know if you are facing any challenges?
10/10/23, 6:30 pm - +263 71 578 8111: Good day madam I think he is facing network challenges because I am also failing to connect with him
10/10/23, 7:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I will be closing our session for now, and I shall be connecting with you tomorrow at 3:00 PM for further progress in our session for the admission process. Have a great day ahead, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well!
11/10/23, 10:48 am - +263 71 578 8111: Thanks so much stay blessed
11/10/23, 4:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
11/10/23, 4:20 pm - +263 78 411 9566: Yes understood
11/10/23, 4:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
11/10/23, 4:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
11/10/23, 4:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
11/10/23, 4:46 pm - +263 78 411 9566: No I'm following
11/10/23, 4:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
11/10/23, 5:00 pm - +263 78 411 9566: I might need some more information
11/10/23, 5:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
11/10/23, 5:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
11/10/23, 5:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
11/10/23, 5:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
11/10/23, 5:21 pm - +263 78 411 9566: Okay now I understand
11/10/23, 5:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
11/10/23, 5:34 pm - +263 78 411 9566: Yes I  agree
11/10/23, 5:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
11/10/23, 5:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
11/10/23, 5:51 pm - +263 78 411 9566: Yes understood
11/10/23, 5:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
11/10/23, 5:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
11/10/23, 10:00 pm - +263 78 411 9566: Yes we are clear
11/10/23, 10:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
11/10/23, 10:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it is late, I will be closing our session for now, and I will be connecting with you tomorrow at 3:00 PM. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
11/10/23, 10:17 pm - +263 78 411 9566: Okay I understand
12/10/23, 2:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon,

*When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it. -Henry Ford*

With that positive note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

If you are ready for the session of your admission process. Shall we begin?
12/10/23, 2:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
12/10/23, 4:22 pm - +263 78 411 9566: Yes we may
12/10/23, 4:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
12/10/23, 4:28 pm - +263 78 411 9566: No I dont
12/10/23, 4:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
12/10/23, 4:31 pm - +263 78 411 9566: Understood
12/10/23, 4:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: So, Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
12/10/23, 4:44 pm - +263 78 411 9566: Yes I am
12/10/23, 4:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for your application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
13/10/23, 1:37 pm - +263 71 578 8111: Good day to you.Thank you for the update.Lookiing forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.
14/10/23, 10:02 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Takunda.

In the meantime, I encourage you to note any questions or concerns. Being prepared with your queries will make our discussion more productive.

15/10/23, 11:48 am - +263 77 801 6455: Congratulations thank you
15/10/23, 11:53 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Takunda!

How are you doing today? May I know if you have been able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
15/10/23, 11:55 am - +263 77 801 6455: Yes
15/10/23, 11:57 am - Milan Edoofa: Wonderful, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
15/10/23, 12:03 pm - +263 77 801 6455: 1.  900 USD                   2.  4yrs.                       3.  300 USD.               4. 750 USD
15/10/23, 12:49 pm - +263 77 801 6455: Number 4 point of correction registration fee to pay $600 USD
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm sorry for going offline during our conversation earlier. I wasn't feeling well with a fever and had to take medicine. I'm back now and ready to continue with our conversation.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across four years. This academic journey is divided into 8 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
15/10/23, 9:45 pm - +263 71 578 8111: Yes it is clear
15/10/23, 9:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
15/10/23, 9:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different.

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/10/23, 9:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
16/10/23, 9:27 am - +263 71 578 8111: Thanks and noted.What is the difference between admission fee and registration fee .
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Takunda!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please I will help you in understanding that. For now, may I know if you are clear till here please?
16/10/23, 11:30 am - +263 77 801 6455: Yes
16/10/23, 11:45 am - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
16/10/23, 11:46 am - +263 71 578 8111: All is well so far
16/10/23, 12:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
16/10/23, 12:47 pm - +263 71 578 8111: It's understood
16/10/23, 12:49 pm - +263 71 578 8111: Is the university in a town or countryside like in our Zim case we have cities, towns,farms,mines and communal areas
16/10/23, 3:33 pm - +263 71 578 8111: Yes
16/10/23, 3:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
16/10/23, 3:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
16/10/23, 3:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
16/10/23, 3:35 pm - +263 71 578 8111: Yes we are together
16/10/23, 3:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
16/10/23, 3:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
16/10/23, 3:39 pm - +263 71 578 8111: I stay in Rusape.I have a forex account with NMB bank
16/10/23, 3:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
16/10/23, 3:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
16/10/23, 3:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: This message was deleted
16/10/23, 3:44 pm - +263 71 578 8111: Ok thanks that will be ok
16/10/23, 3:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
16/10/23, 3:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
16/10/23, 3:47 pm - +263 71 578 8111: I prefer the Harare man it's a bit cheaper
16/10/23, 3:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, you can do that as well. However, for your reference, let me share the details here again. 

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
16/10/23, 3:49 pm - +263 71 578 8111: I have close relatives in Harare whom I can give the cash to handover to him.
16/10/23, 3:49 pm - +263 71 578 8111: Thanks anyway for the details
16/10/23, 3:58 pm - +263 71 578 8111: May you please shade light on the safety and security of outside campus residences.While my wish was for my son to stay on campus with unfolding developments in my country chances are that the USD currency might be scratched so I want to make unformed decisions.
17/10/23, 2:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Takunda!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 2:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes.

Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students. I hope this gives you the assurance that you needed, right?
17/10/23, 3:51 pm - +263 71 578 8111: Yes true
17/10/23, 3:53 pm - +263 71 578 8111: I shall strive to secure accommodation on campus for the first years of his studies.
17/10/23, 4:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know. Now, For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
19/10/23, 9:30 am - +263 71 578 8111: Ok noted with thanks
19/10/23, 9:44 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Takunda!
I hope you are doing well today.
19/10/23, 9:44 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know dear. Now, shall we move ahead with our discussion here please?
19/10/23, 9:50 am - +263 77 801 6455: Yes
19/10/23, 9:52 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know. Now, before we move ahead, may I know if you are clear till here as well please?
19/10/23, 11:26 am - +263 71 578 8111: It's clear
19/10/23, 11:27 am - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
19/10/23, 11:27 am - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
19/10/23, 11:40 am - +263 77 801 6455: Yes it's clear
19/10/23, 11:41 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.	
	
With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
19/10/23, 11:42 am - +263 77 801 6455: Sure
19/10/23, 11:43 am - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
19/10/23, 11:45 am - +263 77 801 6455: No queries
19/10/23, 11:47 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
19/10/23, 11:47 am - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

19/10/23, 12:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I would encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.
