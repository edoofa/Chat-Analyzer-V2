24/08/23, 2:17 pm - +263 77 851 5686: Yes they are clear
24/08/23, 2:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
24/08/23, 2:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
24/08/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 851 5686: Yes we are following
24/08/23, 2:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
24/08/23, 2:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
24/08/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 851 5686: Yes they are
24/08/23, 2:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
24/08/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 851 5686: Yes
24/08/23, 2:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
24/08/23, 2:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
24/08/23, 2:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall share the videos with you now.
24/08/23, 2:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
24/08/23, 2:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
24/08/23, 2:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
24/08/23, 2:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
24/08/23, 2:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
24/08/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 851 5686: I think in the evening I would have went through all of them
24/08/23, 2:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so let us reconnect today at 09.00 pm. I hope you will be available.
24/08/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 851 5686: Yes Ms Kirti
24/08/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, With regard to our conversation, may I know if you were able to go through the videos by now?
24/08/23, 8:33 pm - +263 77 294 3780: Greetings to you ....yes I went through them all
24/08/23, 8:35 pm - +263 77 851 5686: Yes I went throught them just now
24/08/23, 8:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know, so could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
24/08/23, 8:57 pm - +263 77 851 5686: Video1
The founders share that students should be open minded. The EDOOFA  program is a life transforming program as it was to the named student. They also mentioned that the EWYL program. helps children as they have a feeling independence because they earn scholarship credits. Students should follow instructions to reach their full peak. 

VIDEO 2
EDOOFA does not only give admissions but gives you vision instead of staying in dormitories.  It achieves this by offering scholarships to open minded individuals. EDOOFA then acts as parents as it exposes students to the harsh reality of the world who are used to getting everything on a silver platter. It challenges students thus being a world of opportunities.

VIDEO 3
The festival of Holi helps in expressing gratitude. The universities chosen by EDOOFA are 250 and they were chosen by specific considerations placing the parents' expectations at hand. Attitude, skills and knowledge is the combination which EDOOFA helps instill in students as they are greatly required in companies. The combination brings better opportunities than a person who does nit have. Students build an attitude of serving the community.

VIDEO 4
SOP creates a first impression. It is about a proper and clear document. It should include abilities, unique traits, skills, strength, achievements, vision, and why you have chosen the desired program. One should be smart and never delay the forms.
24/08/23, 8:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
24/08/23, 8:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
24/08/23, 8:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
24/08/23, 9:04 pm - +263 77 851 5686: Thanking you for adding on.....I have understood  it very well
24/08/23, 9:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
24/08/23, 9:08 pm - +263 77 851 5686: Thank you. I am following
24/08/23, 9:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Tomorrow at 01.00 pm.
24/08/23, 9:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

*2. O-Level Results*

24/08/23, 9:16 pm - +263 77 851 5686: On the first question is it a brief introduction about myself?

I hope we are clear?
24/08/23, 9:19 pm - +263 77 851 5686: Yes we are clear. Thank you very much
24/08/23, 9:21 pm - +263 77 851 5686: Thank you. We will submit by 1 tomorrow
24/08/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, alright, let us reconnect tomorrow at 01.00 pm. Have a great night and convey my regards to your parents as well.
24/08/23, 9:26 pm - +263 77 851 5686: Same to you....I will definitely forward your regards to them
24/08/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you.
25/08/23, 12:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tanatswa.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation may I know if you were able to fill out the SOP form and complete the tasks by now?
25/08/23, 12:47 pm - +263 77 851 5686: Good afternoon...I am almost done
25/08/23, 12:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know, I shall wait for your response.
25/08/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 851 5686: The second question that says attorney....does it want me to define a defense a atorney
25/08/23, 2:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You need to differentiate between a prosecutor and an attorney here it depends upon you how would you differentiate between them. You can add points according to you.
25/08/23, 5:44 pm - +263 77 851 5686: 2. Please elaborate on the difference between rights and duties and give a further explanation of the difference in human rights and civil rights.

By definition, duties are something that one is expected to do by moral or legal obligation. It can be further explained as the obligation force of something that is morally or legally right. Whereas rights are powers or privileges held by the general public as a result of a constitution, statute. Thereby, the difference noted between the above-mentioned is that duties are seen as moral debts of individuals recognised by society, whereas rights are claims of individuals also recognised by society.

Human rights are defined as the moral principles for various standards of human behaviour and are occasionally protected in municipal and international law. Civil rights are an essential component of democracy. Thus implies that they are guarantees of equal social, political, and economic opportunities and protection under the law despite one's race and religion. Therefore, the difference between the above two is that civil rights are often granted by a government, whereas human rights are considered universal. Human rights are applicable to all human beings regardless of identity, but civil rights are restricted to certain groups. 

3. What is the difference between a prosecutor and an attorney?

A prosecutor, in simpler terms, is a government official who conducts criminal prosecutions on behalf of the state. He brings criminal charges and must prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt whilst the attorney represents the accused person of a crime and attempts to maintain their client's innocence. A prosecutor is powerful as he determines which laws are enforced and against whom and the depth of the punishment to instil on the offender. However, an attorney's power rests on how strong they raise their argument, how well they know the prosecutor, and their court strategy. Being a defence attorney tarnishes the reputation of the lawyer as the media scrutinises one's decision to defend whereas the prosecutor and is praised for bringing justice to the supposedly wronged.

4. Which branch of law are you most interested in pursuing, civil, criminal, or corporate, and why?

I am most interested in criminal law as I believe in securing a safe environment for all citizens. My utmost desire is to defend the wrongly accused victims who will be severely sentenced all in the name of justice. My desire is to evoke change in the law industry. Our world is gradually going corrupt each day, thus the need to stand to the continuously broken laws and to bring justice to the voiceless.

As criminal law is the body of law that relates to crime, it prescribes conduct perceived as threatening l, harmful or otherwise endangering to the property, health, safety and welfare of people inclusive on one's self. Punishment and rehabilitation of people who violate the law is what they would like. The inhuman degrading treatment of murdering, thievery, e.t.c, is constantly threatening the world. There is therefore the dire need to eradicate these increasing criminal activities and send a message to the rest of the world.

5. What skills do you believe you have that will make you a successful lawyer. Please elaborate on your answer

Being a lawyer requires one who pays particular attention to every little detail, and I possess these abilities. I am a wide reader-one who loves indulging in the art of writing. Such indulgence will enhance understanding. Thus, success as a lawyer is inevitable. Furthermore, my experience with debate will conjure up my success in the law industry as debate is a mini-court where students acquire confidence, rebuting skills, and analytical and research skills.

26/08/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 851 5686: We have submitted the SOP form ma'am
28/08/23, 2:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tanatswa.

I hope you are doing well, since it was the weekend, hence we could not connect with you earlier, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
28/08/23, 4:12 pm - +263 77 851 5686: Good afternoon ma'am
28/08/23, 4:12 pm - +263 77 851 5686: Yes
28/08/23, 4:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
28/08/23, 4:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
28/08/23, 4:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelor of Arts in Legislative Law for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
28/08/23, 4:25 pm - +263 77 851 5686: Yes that's correct
28/08/23, 4:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
28/08/23, 4:33 pm - +263 77 851 5686: Yes we are
28/08/23, 4:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
28/08/23, 4:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
28/08/23, 4:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
28/08/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 851 5686: Yes that's right
28/08/23, 4:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
28/08/23, 4:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
28/08/23, 4:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
28/08/23, 4:42 pm - +263 77 851 5686: They did discuss with us
28/08/23, 4:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
28/08/23, 4:44 pm - +263 77 851 5686: Yes... that is understood
28/08/23, 4:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
28/08/23, 7:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if we are still connected with each other?
29/08/23, 2:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tanatswa.

I hope you are doing well, I was hoping to connect with you, however, you did not respond, may I know if you are available to connect now?
29/08/23, 4:42 pm - +263 77 851 5686: Yes. Good afternoon ma'am
29/08/23, 5:57 pm - +263 77 294 3780: How are you ma'am.very sorry I was offline.Tanatswa resumed her school lessons so she will be at school until 4:30pm.but we are available now.. sorry once again
29/08/23, 7:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, thank you for letting me know, that is alright, may I know if you are available to connect now?
29/08/23, 7:55 pm - +263 77 851 5686: Yes please
29/08/23, 7:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, may I know if you are clear here?
29/08/23, 7:56 pm - +263 77 851 5686: Yes it is clear
29/08/23, 7:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
29/08/23, 7:58 pm - +263 77 851 5686: Yes I am following
29/08/23, 7:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
29/08/23, 8:14 pm - +263 77 294 3780: So on registration fee we have to wait for the offer letter...am I right here?
29/08/23, 8:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, indeed you are absolutely correct.
29/08/23, 8:17 pm - +263 77 294 3780: Ok ..clear
29/08/23, 8:17 pm - +263 77 294 3780: So far so good
29/08/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, Now moving forward, I would like to share an insight with you.

30/08/23, 4:55 pm - +263 77 851 5686: <Media omitted>
30/08/23, 5:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the EWYL pledge form, it is duly noted with us I have gone through your form and noted your preference to commence your EWYL journey by 1st September 2023 and we are all prepared to initiate your EWYL program by 4th September as agreed upon.
30/08/23, 5:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the meantime, we will focus on your admission journey. Now that you have a clear understanding of the admission process, I encourage you to have a discussion with your family regarding the financial requirements. This will allow them to plan effectively and move in the right direction.
30/08/23, 5:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Given that your university admission is scheduled for the August 2024 intake, our next step is to reconnect with you and discuss when to commence the same journey. 

We have scheduled our session for today at 09.00 P.M. to begin the admission process. Please ensure that both you and your parents are available for this session. We understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise, and if, for any reason, you or your parents cannot connect as planned, kindly inform us in advance.
30/08/23, 5:07 pm - +263 77 851 5686: We will be able to connect at 9.00pm today
30/08/23, 5:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, let us reconnect today at 09.00 pm. I hope you will be available.
30/08/23, 9:11 pm - +263 77 851 5686: Yes we will be available
30/08/23, 9:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings. Now I believe you have had a discussion with your family regarding your admission process, so I would like to know if you have any queries or concerns to share?
30/08/23, 9:16 pm - +263 77 294 3780: No queries yet
30/08/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
30/08/23, 9:21 pm - +263 77 851 5686: No we have not been made aware
30/08/23, 9:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand Tanatswa, it is alright, let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.

For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
30/08/23, 9:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
30/08/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 294 3780: Ooooh great news to hear..thank you so much ma'am...I'm very happy to hear this... surely it relieve us...I'm happy to hear this...thank you Edoofa👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
30/08/23, 9:34 pm - +263 77 851 5686: Yes, I understand, and it would definitely relieve my parents
30/08/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing to hear that, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
30/08/23, 9:38 pm - +263 77 851 5686: Yes please
30/08/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
30/08/23, 9:39 pm - +263 77 851 5686: No we were not aware of that
30/08/23, 9:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:

1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.
2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.
3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.
4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.
30/08/23, 9:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, choosing the early decision benefits brings two additional advantages:

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able admission for the 2025 intake.
6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.
7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.

*The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program*
30/08/23, 9:44 pm - +263 77 851 5686: We are following
30/08/23, 9:44 pm - +263 77 294 3780: Ok.good options there
30/08/23, 9:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
30/08/23, 9:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. As you await your A-Level results, initiating the university admission process now positions you as an early applicant. This status comes with the advantage of receiving a provisional letter of intent from the university. This letter will outline your scholarship percentage and associated fees. Once you complete your registration formalities and your results are available, you'll be provided with your Official Admission Letter. This letter will enable you to proceed with your student visa application. I trust this point is now clear to you.
30/08/23, 9:47 pm - +263 77 851 5686: Yes it is clear now
30/08/23, 9:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
30/08/23, 9:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Students now have the reamrkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This can be achieved by making an early decision to initiate the university admission process and securing your seat in advance. By taking this step, you can avail the early decision benefits previously mentioned. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
30/08/23, 9:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
30/08/23, 9:51 pm - +263 77 851 5686: Yes it does
30/08/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
30/08/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be skillfully adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
30/08/23, 9:55 pm - +263 77 294 3780: Good to hear... following
30/08/23, 9:57 pm - +263 77 851 5686: The explanation resonates well with
30/08/23, 9:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, we're offering the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
30/08/23, 9:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
30/08/23, 9:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 1, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 1, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 1, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
30/08/23, 9:59 pm - +263 77 851 5686: Yes, we are following... no inquires so far
30/08/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
30/08/23, 10:04 pm - +263 77 851 5686: May you please provide more information on that
30/08/23, 10:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student decides to initiate their admission process before receiving their A-Level results, they gain the advantage of early registration benefits. At this stage, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from entities like Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship percentage as promised.
30/08/23, 10:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there might be a scenario where the student might not achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels. 

In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship. However, if a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university with early decision benefits, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged.
30/08/23, 10:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: On the other hand, if a student manages to achieve a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application once the results are available. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how this gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process as per the standard procedures?
30/08/23, 10:11 pm - +263 77 851 5686: Yes I understand completely
30/08/23, 10:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a student fails to get at least two A-Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, This means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
30/08/23, 10:17 pm - +263 77 851 5686: Yes that's correct
30/08/23, 10:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career ((Benefit Number 7)*
30/08/23, 10:18 pm - +263 77 851 5686: Yes I believe so
30/08/23, 10:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, that is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2023 and once her results come in 2024, she will be able to join the August 2024 batch and pursue her bachelor's degree then.
30/08/23, 10:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the early decision benefits, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for 
another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
30/08/23, 10:22 pm - +263 77 851 5686: Yes I am clear with this solution
30/08/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and instead of reappearing for her exams and starting with her Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
30/08/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
30/08/23, 10:27 pm - +263 77 851 5686: Yes, I am clear with this part
30/08/23, 10:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that @263778515686. Now, let us move forward to the last point, 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account
30/08/23, 10:29 pm - +263 77 851 5686: Yes we are following
30/08/23, 10:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Now, I would like you to go through all 7 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 7 points clear?
30/08/23, 10:32 pm - +263 77 851 5686: Yes they are all clear ma'am
30/08/23, 10:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I’m glad to know that you have understood all of this well! Now, I would like you to take some time and have a discussion with your parents concerning the next steps in your university admission journey and update them about the benefits of the early decision. I am sure they would be excited and open to the same opportunity. We shall reconnect on Friday at 01.00 p.m. To carry forward your admission process.
30/08/23, 10:37 pm - +263 77 851 5686: Yes ma'am. Thank you
30/08/23, 10:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Have a great day and convey my regards to your family as well.
30/08/23, 10:40 pm - +263 77 851 5686: I shall convey your regards to them....have a great night
30/08/23, 10:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you.
02/09/23, 9:50 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Tanatswa.

I hope you are doing well, I was expecting a response from you, however, you did not respond, so may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
02/09/23, 9:58 am - +263 77 851 5686: No, we have no queries and the mentor said we start Monday and we don't know her name yet
02/09/23, 9:58 am - +263 77 851 5686: Good morning ma'am.
02/09/23, 10:04 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, in that case, when you connect with your EWYL mentor on Monday, then you can update the same here as well by sending the below message -

Hello Admission officer, I have started my EWYL journey and my mentor is Mr./Ms. __"
02/09/23, 10:05 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you have no queries may I know if your parents are also active for the discussion today?
06/09/23, 6:01 pm - +263 78 465 0764 joined using this group's invite link
06/09/23, 1:49 pm - +263 77 294 3780: We as parents agreed on the early decision it's at our advantage financially
06/09/23, 2:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Great! now I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.*
06/09/23, 2:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due date will be mentioned.
06/09/23, 2:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?*
06/09/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 294 3780: Yes we are together.....I'm following
06/09/23, 2:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is amazing to hear. Alright, please. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
06/09/23, 2:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
06/09/23, 2:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
06/09/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 294 3780: Yes it's very clear.we are mentally and financially prepared for we are serving for this program every month
06/09/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 294 3780: Saving***
06/09/23, 2:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Now you have two ways to proceed with your child’s university admission process -

*1. Proceed as per the standard procedures*
*2. Proceed with the Early Decision Benefits*

Be assured that I will help you understand the difference between both of them so that you can make a well-informed decision regarding your child’s university admission process. Shall we start with our discussion regarding the same?
06/09/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 294 3780: Yes we can
06/09/23, 2:43 pm - +263 77 294 3780: Help us understand the difference
06/09/23, 3:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Brilliant, let us start with the *Standard Registration/University Admission process*-

As you are aware that one’s registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university, to be on the safer side, let us assume that the registration fee is $750 itself.

As per the standard procedures, once you get the offer letter from the university, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of $750.

For example, if you get the offer letter on the 06th of September and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, the deadline for the registration fee would be the 21st of September 2023 and you would have to make the payment of the fee before then. Are you clear about this?
06/09/23, 3:35 pm - +263 77 294 3780: Yes it's clear
06/09/23, 3:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, now let us discuss the *Early Registration/University Admission process -*

As the name states, a student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.

If you do that, you are eligible for all 6 benefits that we discussed earlier. Since the benefit number 3 and 4 helps you ease the registration process, I will be discussing the same in particular and help you understand how that happens -

When we talk about the Early Decision Grant of $150 (benefit number 3)
06/09/23, 3:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To understand the same, let us once again assume that the registration fee due is $750 and if you have a grant of $150, this means that out of the fee due of $750, $150 will be paid by the Edoofa Academic Board on your behalf and hence this leaves your child’s fee due as $750 - $150 = $600.

So, the amount that you will have to pay to reserve/lock your child’s scholarship seat becomes $600.
06/09/23, 3:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

1. The first part ~ $300 is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 06th of January, the deadline becomes the 21st of September, 2023)

2. The second part ~ $300 is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 06th of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 21st of September 2023, making the second deadline the 21st of October, 2023).

Please let me know if we are on the same page here as well?
06/09/23, 3:42 pm - +263 77 294 3780: Yes we are together
06/09/23, 3:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
06/09/23, 4:07 pm - +263 77 294 3780: Very clear .no queries for now
06/09/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, Alright please, before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, Considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
06/09/23, 4:20 pm - +263 77 294 3780: The admission process starts as soon as parents give their go a ahead.the two way to proceed are
 1.standard procedure
2.early decision benefits

On the standard procedure you are given 15 days to pay the  registration fees needed which is $500-$750 in full

On early decision benefits if your registration fee is $750,$150 will be paid by Edoofa Academic board on our behalf.and the remaining $600 is paid in 2 parts.the due date for the first part is 15 days from the date you get the offer letter and the second part is paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee
06/09/23, 4:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days. 

4. With the standard admission process, as a student you are not paying any more fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until your parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with your admission process.

Please let me know if you are clear on this?
06/09/23, 4:36 pm - +263 77 294 3780: Yes I'm very clear on it
06/09/23, 4:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
06/09/23, 4:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Monday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.

When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *21st September* and *21st October*.
06/09/23, 4:42 pm - +263 77 294 3780: We are ready to proceed with the early decision benefits way.
06/09/23, 4:42 pm - +263 77 294 3780: You can go ahead
06/09/23, 4:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have given us the go-ahead to move forward with Tanatswa's university admission process, I believe you are financially confident that you will be able to manage the registration fee in due time by (*21st September* and *21st October*) and are mentally prepared for the next steps?
06/09/23, 4:53 pm - +263 77 294 3780: Yes we are confident
06/09/23, 4:54 pm - +263 77 294 3780: Do we wait to receive the offer letter first as explained before
06/09/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, Indeed, the offer letter will be generated by the university within a week's time.
06/09/23, 7:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, as you have given us the go-ahead, let us proceed towards preparing Tanatswa's application and forward it to the universities, applicable for the course and suggested by the academic board. Once we get an update from the universities, we will reconnect with you and share the same updates with you. In the meantime, if and when you have any queries, feel free to bring them forward so that we can address them and help you plan for Tanatswa's higher education well.
06/09/23, 7:54 pm - +263 78 465 0764: yes ma'am
06/09/23, 7:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send Tanatswa a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
06/09/23, 7:57 pm - +263 78 465 0764: Same to you ma'am. Thank you
06/09/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, and thank you.
08/09/23, 12:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tanatswa!
I hope you all are doing well. 

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa, and today, I have some incredible news to share with you all! After you gave the admissions team the green light to proceed with your university application process, the team worked on processing your application accordingly. And, I'm thrilled to inform you that the university application process has been a success and you have received a prestigious offer from MVN University, along with a remarkable 90% scholarship! Congratulations on this incredible achievement. 🌟✨🎓
08/09/23, 12:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: The University will be mailing you the letter shortly, since we received the letter early, we are sharing it with you here. Take your time to review the letter and then once you are done going through it, we will then have a discussion about the letter in detail and address any questions or concerns you may have. Congratulations on this prestigious offer and securing a 90% scholarship! Your hard work has truly paid off! ⭐🌟
08/09/23, 12:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/09/23, 1:11 pm - +263 77 294 3780: Thank you so much ma'am we are very very excited and very great full about this...thank you once again👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
08/09/23, 1:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome please! I am glad to see that you are so excited about the offer letter. Now, once you are done going through the letter, please let me know of the same so that we can move ahead to discuss that and plan the next steps in your admission journey.
08/09/23, 1:20 pm - +263 77 294 3780: Thank you once again we very excited Mr Milan would you kindly clarify on the $1000 deposit payment. In our previous sessions it was indicated that we are supposed to pay $750, would you perphaps kindly clarify.
08/09/23, 2:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Sure, let me help you with that, please. Now, earlier the cost of education that was informed to you was $2000-3000, please. Out of which $500-750 was the registration fee. 

However, the offer letter that you have received is one of the exceptions here, since you have secured a 90% scholarship and the total per annum cost of education is around $1600, therefore the admission fee is towards a higher end please. I hope this is clear?
08/09/23, 2:12 pm - +263 78 465 0764: Thank you so much...we are very grateful for the offer letter
08/09/23, 2:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, may I know if you have gone through the offer letter by now?
08/09/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 465 0764: yes that's correct
08/09/23, 2:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Glad to hear that please. I would be discussing the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have, and to commence our letter discussion,  I would like to confirm the details mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University.
08/09/23, 2:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Hence, could you please take a moment to review your letter again and provide me with the following information:

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship? 
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is your annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
08/09/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 294 3780: Is registration fee and admission fee the same
08/09/23, 2:27 pm - +263 78 465 0764: 1.$350
2.$0....i am getting a 100% sponsorship on accommodation
3.$1600
4.$125
5.$1000
08/09/23, 2:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, the registration fee as well as the admission fee are the same. Now, Thank you for providing the details. As per your offer letter, MVN University has awarded you a 90% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you will only have to pay 10% of the per annum tuition fee for your course at MVN University, i.e. $350.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in your letter, you have also been awarded a 100% waiver on your accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided to you will be free of cost throughout your stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making your education more affordable, isn’t it?
08/09/23, 2:35 pm - +263 78 465 0764: Yes, it is an excellent opportunity
08/09/23, 2:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as you can see in your offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
08/09/23, 2:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you would be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

Now, for the first year, you can see that there are two components that are one-time payable i.e. Sports Fee and Misc. Fee, so your total expenses for the first year become $1600 + $250 = $1850.

Please note that this cost is only for the first year, and from the second year onwards, your per annum cost of education will be $1600. I hope you are clear about that?
08/09/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 465 0764: yes we are clear on that
08/09/23, 2:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, Now that you are aware of your per annum fee, let me tell you what all facilities are offered by the universities and are covered as per the university's fee structure -

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Exmanitaion Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.

I hope you are clear with this?
08/09/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 465 0764: will the admission fee be subtracted from my first year school fees
08/09/23, 2:42 pm - +263 78 465 0764: yes it is clear
08/09/23, 2:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, that is right. Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, students under the Edoofa Program have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
08/09/23, 2:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
08/09/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 294 3780: Since the admission fee is now payed without part payment..when are we expected to pay the difference???
08/09/23, 2:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: I did not get you here well, can you please come again?
08/09/23, 2:59 pm - +263 77 294 3780: We are supposed to pay $1000 within 15 days as the letter explained...am I right?
08/09/23, 3:15 pm - +263 78 465 0764: Mr Milan, there has been a mistake regarding my admission year, it should be August 2024 and not 2023, August
08/09/23, 3:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. Now, let me help you in understanding the same here. Firstly, when it comes to the admission year, yes please your admission year is of 2024, however, since the university still hasn't closed the 2023 intake, the leters are by default being generated for the current intake. But, since your admission is for the 2024 intake, hence, once your admission will be completed, your intake will then be shifted to 2024. I hope this is clear?
08/09/23, 3:22 pm - +263 78 465 0764: yes this is clear
08/09/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 465 0764: i remember Ms Kirti saying that the Edoofa program will help by paying $150 of the admission fee. I think she must have also mentioned that the admission fee is paid a certain amount at first then the remaining amount is paid in installments. Did we somehow misunderstand
08/09/23, 3:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: @263784650764 Yes, please that is right! Now, moving ahead, we are coming to discuss that please. Before that, may I know if you are clear till here please?
08/09/23, 3:36 pm - +263 77 294 3780: Understood
08/09/23, 3:36 pm - +263 78 465 0764: Yes we are clear
08/09/23, 3:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum education costs of $1600  and so the balance fee becomes $1600 - $1000 = $600 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
08/09/23, 3:43 pm - +263 78 465 0764: yes, this will definitely make my education affordable and reduce my family's financial pressure
08/09/23, 3:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, as informed, the admission and processing fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter will be adjusted against your first year’s expenses of $1850, therefore the amount of fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $1850  - $1000 = $850.

I hope you are clear about this as well?
08/09/23, 3:52 pm - +263 78 465 0764: Yes we are clear
08/09/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 294 3780: Clear
08/09/23, 4:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the admission fee of $1000 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.

But, with regards to our previous conversations and the benefits you have as an Edoofian, I am sure you recall that you have the $150 Grant as well as you have the privilege to make the payment of the same fee of $850 in two parts as $425 before 22nd September 2023 and $425 before 22nd October 2023. I hope you are clear with that?
08/09/23, 7:20 pm - +263 77 294 3780: Thank you sir ...it's a very easy way for us..thank you once again
09/09/23, 8:14 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tanatswa!
I hope you are doing well today.
09/09/23, 8:15 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due. The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
09/09/23, 8:15 am - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
09/09/23, 10:16 am - +263 77 294 3780: Morning sir sorry was a bit tied up
09/09/23, 10:16 am - +263 77 294 3780: Yes you can give us the alternative
09/09/23, 10:17 am - +263 77 294 3780: We stay in Mabelreign area in Harare
09/09/23, 10:18 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you are planning to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
09/09/23, 10:18 am - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
09/09/23, 10:18 am - Milan Edoofa: This message was deleted
09/09/23, 10:18 am - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
09/09/23, 10:20 am - +263 77 294 3780: Ok thanks for the contact
09/09/23, 10:21 am - +263 77 294 3780: So will he give us the proof of payment??
09/09/23, 10:27 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, once you will make the payment to him, he will be sharing a receipt with you for the same. Moving ahead, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
09/09/23, 10:55 am - +263 77 294 3780: Ooh ok sure..we can use Mr jerera account.. please share.
11/09/23, 12:51 pm - +263 77 294 3780: Afternoon sir

11/09/23, 12:52 pm - +263 77 294 3780: We have made the payment for the first part of our money on offer letter ...that's the proof of payment
11/09/23, 12:52 pm - +263 77 294 3780: We have added the 11%
11/09/23, 1:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tanatswa!
I hope you are doing well today.
11/09/23, 1:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the payment receipt with us here, however, on that note, I would like to mention that since you have made the payment to Mr. Charles's account there is a slight change in the same, i.e. Mr. Charles has changed his FBC Account and therefore, the payment was to be made on the new account details. 

However, since you have already made the payment, you need to revisit the bank and ask them to retrace the payment back to you and then get it done on the new details. Let me share the same with you here.

12/09/23, 1:46 pm - +263 77 294 3780: Afternoon..no I didn't get time will do it tomorrow and update
12/09/23, 1:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Once you are done with that, please let me know.

22/12/23, 7:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Tanatswa,

I trust that you and your family are doing well today. I am pleased to connect with you today to share some positive updates with you.
22/12/23, 7:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In light of your admission process, As we have shared that one of our partnered universities, Lovely Professional University (LPU), which is among the top 100 universities in India, has been considering your application for the scholarship opportunity. They have mentioned that they would be able to give us an update by the month of January, considering the high volume of applications they have received in the past two months (more than 2000 applications).
22/12/23, 7:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In addition to this, the academic board also mentioned that there are a few more universities willing to put your application in consideration for scholarship opportunities in the month of January. Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter. This approach allows you to have multiple scholarship options, giving you the flexibility to decide on the university for your education in India and then carry out your visa application process the right way.
22/12/23, 7:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this update, I also want to inform you that since we are waiting for updates from the universities, we will be holding our conversation until 20th January and will reconnect around the same time. Until then, we wanted to share these updates with you so that you are well-informed about the process and know what lies ahead. We are thrilled to be a part of this new chapter in your academic journey.
22/12/23, 7:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, now that you are done with your admission process, you are encouraged to channel your energy and focus on your Earn While You Learn (EWYL) journey so that you can maximize the benefits from it. May this period be filled with meaningful learning, personal growth, and amazing opportunities.
