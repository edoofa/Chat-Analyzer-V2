18/08/23, 2:59 pm - +263 71 275 5936: On this first vedio l have understand that a student must be open minded and should follow Edoofa's instruction so that it will be easier for a student.
18/08/23, 3:02 pm - +263 71 275 5936: On this vedio l have understood that Edoofa does not give only quality and affordable education but also help a student to earn success and making a student more responsible and independent.
18/08/23, 3:12 pm - +263 71 275 5936: Edoofa also provides 250+ good school, colleges and universities and they have identified good schools. They have done that so that the Edoofian student will be able to learn at a good school, colleges or universities since they will be acting as good parents so they would make sure that we have quality education.
18/08/23, 3:21 pm - +263 71 275 5936: I have understood that on the Statement of purpose students should be prompt in taking action and be diligent in filling out the form and also they have said that "be smart, do smart work, do prompt work" and no delays.
18/08/23, 3:23 pm - +263 71 275 5936: Am done Sir.
18/08/23, 3:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
18/08/23, 3:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
18/08/23, 3:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.
18/08/23, 3:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
18/08/23, 3:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now, dear?
18/08/23, 3:30 pm - +263 71 275 5936: This message was deleted
18/08/23, 3:33 pm - +263 71 275 5936: Yes sir am on the same page with you.
18/08/23, 3:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, dear. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
18/08/23, 3:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by this evening at 9:00 PM.
18/08/23, 3:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded, please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

18/08/23, 9:05 pm - +263 71 275 5936: 2.The difference between rights and duties and give further explanation of the difference in human rights and civil rights.

Rights are things a person have which people think should not be taken away. It is also a rule about what a person is allowed to do or have Also rights is a permission to do something or an entitlement to a specific service or treatment from others. In other words, a right is any action of a person which law permits.

While duties are actions or tasks required by a person's position or occupation function. Also a duty is a moral or legal abligation, a responsibility. It is also a task or action that one is required to perform as part of ones job.

Human rights are moral principles or norms for certain standards of human behavior and are regularly protected in municipal ans internal law. They are commonly understood as inalienable, fundamental rights "to which are inherent in all human beings" , regardless of their age, ethics, origin, location, language, religion or any other status. They applicable everywhere and every time in the sense of being universal and they are egalitarian in the sense of being the same of everyone.

While civil rights are the rights of individuals to receive equal treatment (and to be free from unfair treatment or discrimination in a number of settings). Civil rights are personal rights guaranteed and protected. Civil rights are rights that protect individuals freedom from infringement by governments social organizations and private individuals. They ensure one's entitlement .
18/08/23, 9:06 pm - +263 71 275 5936: 3.What is the difference between prosecutor and an attorney?

A prosecutor is a legal representive of the prosecution in states with either the common law adversarial system or the civil law inquisitorial system. Prosecutor seek to protect the innocent and convict the guilty, consider the interest of victims and witness, and respect the constitutional  and legal right of all persons, including suspects  and defendants. A prosecutor has the responsibility of directing the enforcement of criminal decision made by court for the enforcement of state penalty efficiency and justice of law.

While an attorney is a person, typically a lawyer, appointed to act for another in business or legal matters. Attorney advise and represent clients in criminal or civil proceedings and in other legal matters. An attorney communicate with clients, colleagues, judges and others involved in case. Interpret law rulings and regulations for individuals and businesses. An attorney are certified professionals who in legal matters. They consel clients, perform legal research, prepare, legal documents and represent clients in criminal and civil court proceedings.
18/08/23, 9:07 pm - +263 71 275 5936: 4.Which branch of law are you most interested in pursuing, Civil, Corporate or Criminal and why?

I am interested in corporate law because corporate law is the body of law governing the rights, relations and conduct of persons, companies, organizations and businesses. Corporate law is also related to corporations, or other companies, organizations and many more. Also corporate law often describes the law relating to matters which derive directly from life-cycle of a corporate law because corporate law is the establishment of laws that govern how corporations are formed and operated.

Futhermore am interested in working with corporations so a corporate lawyer make sure all of their transactions are legal by providing advice on their rights and obligations. Essentially they work to make sure corporations are making decisions that provide the most benefit while remaining legal. Also corporations usually prefer to get all the they need one firm, which is another reason l want to do corporate law because they need the necessary help from the corporate lawyer and also l am willing.
18/08/23, 9:07 pm - +263 71 275 5936: 5.What skills do you believe you have that will make you successful lawyer?

Skills that l believe l have that communicating skills, time management, writing, critical thinking, strategic thinking, reading and comprehension, active listening and hearing, complex problem solving and teamwork.

For someone to become a Lawyer that person must have the ability to work in teamwork is essential. I have been involved in so many clubs that requires teamwork for them to function. These clubs include intercat club. Environmental Management Agency (EMA). These clubs needs teamwork for them to function and l was active in those clubs.

Also for someone to become a lawyer that person must be a critical thicker and a strategic thicker. I was once a prefect and l was involved in solving many students issues. These issues needs someone who can solve these problems and these includes, sometimes a student is involved in drugs l as a prefect we could make sure that the problem is solved strategically.

Futhermore l have good communication skills because we could stand at the front of the school sometimes the community talking to people and also l was involved in the debate club and public speaking clubs. These clubs helped me to have communication skills and to have confidence.

I also think that l have got time management because at the debate club and public speaking club we were thought to have time management and also we could talk while having a timer and l could win those competitions.

In conclusion through the clubs l was involved and the position l had at O level studies helped me to have writing, reading and comprehension, active listening and hearing skills.

*“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world” – Nelson Mandela*

With that positive note I am here to continue with your session. 

Shall we begin?
19/08/23, 12:22 pm - +263 71 275 5936: Good Afternoon Sir.
19/08/23, 12:22 pm - +263 71 275 5936: Thank you for the moltivational speech
19/08/23, 12:23 pm - +263 71 275 5936: Yes we can begin.
19/08/23, 12:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that, dear. Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.

*For that, I believe you want to pursue Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws (BA LLB) course for your higher education in India as per the August 2025 intake, right?*
19/08/23, 12:39 pm - +263 71 275 5936: Yes Sir its correct.
19/08/23, 12:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
19/08/23, 12:43 pm - +263 71 275 5936: Yes am ready Sir.
19/08/23, 12:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
19/08/23, 12:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
19/08/23, 12:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
19/08/23, 12:54 pm - +263 71 275 5936: Yes it is not possible to study at multiple universities
19/08/23, 12:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is indeed correct, dear. So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
19/08/23, 12:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.
19/08/23, 12:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
19/08/23, 12:58 pm - +263 71 275 5936: Yes my counselor discussed with me about it.
19/08/23, 12:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
19/08/23, 1:00 pm - +263 71 275 5936: Yes it is understood.
19/08/23, 1:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
19/08/23, 1:03 pm - +263 71 275 5936: Yes it is clear.
19/08/23, 1:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months.
19/08/23, 1:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

19/08/23, 1:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You will be required to pay the registration fee of $750 all at once within a span of 2 weeks. I understand that this might be challenging.

19/08/23, 1:15 pm - +263 71 275 5936: Oky oky its now clear.
19/08/23, 1:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright, now Natalie, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2025 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2024 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Monday so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
19/08/23, 1:30 pm - +263 71 275 5936: Oky thank you Sir we will connect with you on Monday.

Please let me know when you are available anytime now to proceed with the session.
15/09/23, 7:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
15/09/23, 7:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents Natalie. I hope you are well and blessed. May I know if you are ready to further proceed with the session?
15/09/23, 7:35 pm - +263 71 275 5936: Good Evening Sir. Yes we can further proceed with the session.
15/09/23, 7:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
15/09/23, 7:46 pm - +263 71 275 5936: No we are not aware of the this opportunity.
15/09/23, 7:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand Natalie, it is alright, let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.

For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
 
As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
15/09/23, 8:01 pm - +263 71 275 5936: Yes it will help my parents a lot.
15/09/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing to hear that, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
15/09/23, 8:23 pm - +263 71 275 5936: Yes l would like to know more about the Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant.
15/09/23, 8:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
15/09/23, 8:27 pm - +263 71 275 5936: No but am now aware of that.
15/09/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:

1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.

3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
15/09/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, choosing the early decision benefits brings two additional advantages:

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.

*The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program*
15/09/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Pleasee lt me know once you have gone through these benefits so that we can discuss all of them one by one.
15/09/23, 8:31 pm - +263 71 275 5936: I have gone through the benefits.
15/09/23, 9:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
15/09/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them. Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
16/09/23, 3:02 am - +263 71 275 5936: Yes it is a clear point now.
16/09/23, 12:03 pm - +263 71 275 5936: Good Afternoon Sir, hope you are doing well.
18/09/23, 3:56 pm - +263 77 247 0987: It was fine
18/09/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that. Could you let me know if you're available to continue the session at any time now?
18/09/23, 4:07 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Yes  I am ready
18/09/23, 4:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I am happy to hear that. In continuation with our session. Each year the universities revise their fee structure and it is highly possible that the fee would be increased for the academic year 2024. Over the past few years, we have seen a hike of 20%-30% in the tuition fee and to help our students from the same, students have been given the opportunity to keep their fee structure as per the current academic year of 2023.
18/09/23, 4:12 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Ok following
18/09/23, 4:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here, if you make the early decision to start with your university admission process and decide to reserve your seat with the university earlier, you will be able to get the above-mentioned early decision benefit and this would help you keep your fee structure the same for the complete course of your bachelor’s education in India.
18/09/23, 4:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even if the fee increases for your admission intake which is 2024, you would be protected against that and your fee will be in accordance with 2023. Are we on the same page here?
18/09/23, 4:14 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Yes we are sir
18/09/23, 4:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. Here, when you receive the Letter of Intent (Offer Letter) from the university, the registration fee would be mentioned, so by the grant of $150 means, if your registration fee is $750, then the actual registration fee that you have to pay will be only $600. 

Once the payment of $600 is made by you, the complete amount of $750 will be adjusted against your first-year university fee since we will be paying the $150 to the university on your behalf. Have you understood?
18/09/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Yes l have understood
18/09/23, 4:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. If your finances aren't prepared, and you need some time, in such cases, *Edoofa* is giving an option to make the payment of the Registration fee in 2 parts, the first part i.e. 50% of the registration fee after the grant of $150, has to be paid within the time period mentioned by the university and the second part i.e. the remaining 50% of the registration fee has to be paid within 30 days from the first deadline date. 

For example, if your deadline is 30th September 2023, and your registration fee after the grant is $600, then you have to pay $300 on or before 30th September 2023, and the remaining $300 has to be paid by 30th October 2023. Any queries so far? <This message was edited>
18/09/23, 4:32 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Oky this opportunity is great..,..l would like to ask when the grant would be offered
18/09/23, 4:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The EDB grant will be applicable to any offer letter that you might be receiving in the near future. May I know if we are on the same page here?
18/09/23, 4:42 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Ok yes we are on the same page
18/09/23, 4:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through all 4 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 4 points clear?
18/09/23, 4:59 pm - +263 77 247 0987: We can proceed l have understood
18/09/23, 5:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright, I’m glad to know that you have understood all of this well! Now, I would like you to take some time and have a discussion with your family concerning the next steps in your university admission journey and update them about the benefits of the early decision. I am sure they would be excited and open to the same opportunity. So, let us schedule our session for 7:30 Pm this evening. May I know if that works for you?
18/09/23, 5:29 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Yes sir we will be available
18/09/23, 5:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that.
18/09/23, 7:42 pm - +263 71 275 5936: Good evening Sir.
18/09/23, 7:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, Natalie. I'm interested in knowing whether you've had the opportunity to engage in a conversation regarding the advantages of early decision, as we touched upon the previous day..
18/09/23, 7:46 pm - +263 71 275 5936: Yes l had an opportunity to engage in the conversation regarding the early decision.
18/09/23, 7:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I would be pleased if you let me know how was the discussion on the Early Decision Benefits and what was your thoughts by your parents?
18/09/23, 7:48 pm - +263 71 275 5936: I think the early decision is beneficial according to my thoughts and my family,we found it as an advantage to us.
18/09/23, 8:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear, dear. Now before we move forward and have a conversation regarding the same, may I know if your parents are available with us for this session and if they have any queries that you would like to ask or any concerns that have been bothering you and you would like to share?
18/09/23, 8:18 pm - +263 71 275 5936: They are not available for the session, if they have any questions they will ask, as for me everything is clear.
18/09/23, 9:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Great! It is good to know all of us are on the same page. I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.*
18/09/23, 9:30 pm - +263 71 275 5936: Oky my parents will respond then.
18/09/23, 9:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, may I know if they are available?
18/09/23, 10:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Since it is late and it has been a long day for me, and the available hours are coming to an end, we shall proceed with our session tomorrow afternoon at 3:00 PM. I hope this works for you, and have a great night.
19/09/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Good afternoon
19/09/23, 4:35 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Good day sir

You can proceed with the admission process
19/09/23, 5:05 pm - +263 71 275 5936: Good Afternoon Sir.
19/09/23, 6:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Natalie,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. I was not able to connect with you at our scheduled time as I was occupied with retrieving our proud Edooﬁans from the airport. I would like to share a glimpse of this experience with my students. Along with that, I would like to reschedule our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM. I hope this timing works for you. Have a great day!
19/09/23, 6:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 7:10 pm - +263 71 275 5936: Thank you Sir, have a great day too
19/09/23, 7:12 pm - +263 71 275 5936: That's great Sir.
20/09/23, 2:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon! I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. How are you enjoying this lovely afternoon?
20/09/23, 3:04 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Good afternoon we are fine
20/09/23, 3:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Are you prepared and ready for our session?
20/09/23, 3:08 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Yes sir I'm ready
20/09/23, 3:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Let us continue with the session.
20/09/23, 3:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due date will be mentioned.
20/09/23, 3:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?*
20/09/23, 3:12 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Oky noted
20/09/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Yes we are sir
20/09/23, 3:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is amazing to hear. Alright, please. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
20/09/23, 3:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
20/09/23, 3:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
20/09/23, 3:23 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Yes we are clear on this
20/09/23, 3:24 pm - +263 77 247 0987: I want to ask if we can be able to pay the money in two parts as you mentioned above the other day
20/09/23, 3:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, you can do that. We are coming to that now.
20/09/23, 3:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now you have two ways to proceed with your child’s university admission process -

*1. Proceed as per the standard procedures*
*2. Proceed with the Early Decision Benefits*

Be assured that I will help you understand the difference between both of them so that you can make a well-informed decision regarding your child’s university admission process. Shall we start with our discussion regarding the same?
20/09/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Oky
20/09/23, 3:42 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Yes we can start
20/09/23, 3:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, let us start with the *Standard Registration/University Admission process*-

As you are aware that one’s registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university, to be on the safer side, let us assume that the registration fee is $750 itself.

As per the standard procedures, once you get the offer letter from the university, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of $750.

For example, if you get the offer letter on the 23th of September and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, the deadline for the registration fee would be the 9th of October 2023 and you would have to make the payment of the fee before then. Are you clear about this?
20/09/23, 3:45 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Yes it is clear
20/09/23, 4:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great, now let us discuss the *Early Registration/University Admission process -*

As the name states, a student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.

If you do that, you are eligible for all 6 benefits that we discussed earlier. Since the benefit number 3 and 4 helps you ease the registration process, I will be discussing the same in particular and help you understand how that happens -

When we talk about the Early Decision Grant of $150 (benefit number 3)
20/09/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Oky following
20/09/23, 4:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To understand the same, let us once again assume that the registration fee due is $750 and if you have a grant of $150, this means that out of the fee due of $750, $150 will be paid by the Edoofa Academic Board on your behalf and hence this leaves your child’s fee due as $750 - $150 = $600.

So, the amount that you will have to pay to reserve/lock your child’s scholarship seat becomes $600.
20/09/23, 4:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

*1. The first part ~ $300* is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 23rd of September, the deadline becomes the 9th of October, 2023)

*2. The second part ~ $300* is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 23rd of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 9th of October 2023, making the second deadline the 9th of November, 2023).
20/09/23, 4:19 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Noted
20/09/23, 4:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
20/09/23, 4:30 pm - +263 77 247 0987: I have understood.......so the standard registration does not pay in installments right?
20/09/23, 4:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is indeed correct.
20/09/23, 4:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, now before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
20/09/23, 4:35 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Oky so the early registration is better
20/09/23, 4:35 pm - +263 77 247 0987: We are on the same page now
20/09/23, 4:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. So, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
20/09/23, 4:43 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Sorry l don't understand is the registration fee not supposed to be given by the university
20/09/23, 4:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is indeed correct, I am referring to the above assumptions that we just had. So, may I know if you might be able to answer that?
20/09/23, 4:46 pm - +263 77 247 0987: We will go with the early registration
20/09/23, 4:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you would be able to give me a brief understanding on the what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates for each approach based on the above assumptions ?
20/09/23, 4:52 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Oky so on the early registration

Once the university give the student admission......they give us a certain amount for registration and it wi be paid in two parts for example the first part will be paid within 15 days and the rest after after a month 

There will also be a grant of $150 which means on the given registration fee offered by the university we will less it with $150 grant fee
20/09/23, 4:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days.
20/09/23, 4:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. With the standard admission process, as a student you are not paying any more amount of fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until your parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with your admission process.

Please let me know if you are clear on this?
20/09/23, 4:58 pm - +263 77 247 0987: It's all clear


You may proceed with the admission
20/09/23, 5:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
20/09/23, 5:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Monday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.

When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *9th October* and *9th November*.
20/09/23, 5:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, If you as parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines ( *9th October* and *9th November* .), you can give us the go-ahead so that we can prepare Natalie’s application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
20/09/23, 5:08 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Yes we are comfortable with it sir
20/09/23, 5:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have given us the go-ahead to move forward with Natalie’s university admission process, I believe you are financially confident that you will be able to manage the registration fee in due time by ( *9th October* and *9th November**) and are mentally prepared for the next steps?
20/09/23, 5:13 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Yes sir
20/09/23, 5:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, as you have given us the go-ahead, let us proceed towards preparing Natalie’s application and forward it to the universities, applicable for the course and suggested by the academic board. Once we get an update from the universities, we will reconnect with you and share the same updates with you. In the meantime, if and when you have any queries, feel free to bring them forward so that we can address them and help you plan for Natalie’s higher education well.
20/09/23, 5:18 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Thank you sir
20/09/23, 5:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome parents and Natalie. 

With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned. <This message was edited>
20/09/23, 5:28 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Ok thank you
26/09/23, 1:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Natalie!

27/09/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Good afternoon sir 

Sorry for the delay in responding due to network errors

We went through the offer letter yes
27/09/23, 4:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Galgotias University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
27/09/23, 5:29 pm - +263 71 275 5936: 1.$900
2.3 years
3.$300
4.$750
28/09/23, 10:14 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Natalie!
I hope you are doing well today.
28/09/23, 10:14 am - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
28/09/23, 10:14 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a three-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will 6 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
28/09/23, 10:21 am - +263 77 247 0987: This message was deleted
28/09/23, 10:24 am - +263 77 247 0987: Yes it is clear
28/09/23, 10:24 am - +263 77 247 0987: Good morning
28/09/23, 1:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
28/09/23, 1:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
28/09/23, 1:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
28/09/23, 2:41 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Oky l think this will do
28/09/23, 2:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
28/09/23, 2:43 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Yes we are together
28/09/23, 2:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
28/09/23, 2:54 pm - +263 77 247 0987: It is clear
28/09/23, 3:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
28/09/23, 3:06 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Yes it is clear sir
28/09/23, 3:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
28/09/23, 3:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 10th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 10th November 2023.*
28/09/23, 3:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *10th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
28/09/23, 3:09 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Yes
28/09/23, 3:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
28/09/23, 3:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
28/09/23, 3:09 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Yes it's clear sir
28/09/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 247 0987: No in bindura
28/09/23, 3:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
28/09/23, 3:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
28/09/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Can you help with the banks which l can deposit the money
28/09/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Yes l can do that
28/09/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Oky you can give us the number for communication
28/09/23, 3:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
28/09/23, 3:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
28/09/23, 3:16 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Thank you
28/09/23, 3:16 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Oky go ahead
28/09/23, 3:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, if making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333038009240398
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
28/09/23, 3:18 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Thank you sir
28/09/23, 3:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
28/09/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Oky thank you sir
28/09/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 247 0987: I have a question
28/09/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
28/09/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
28/09/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Is this money payable once or we can pay on installments?
28/09/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Noted
28/09/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Yes it's clear
28/09/23, 3:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
28/09/23, 3:24 pm - +263 77 247 0987: I can see
28/09/23, 3:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
28/09/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Is this money payable once or we can pay on installments?
28/09/23, 3:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Regarding the balance fee, you can pay that in part payments as well, i.e. first part when Natalie will arrive here in India and the second part in the second semester please. I hope this is clear?
28/09/23, 3:28 pm - +263 77 247 0987: Oky yes l understand
