If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?

04/12/23, 6:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>

04/12/23, 6:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
04/12/23, 6:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
04/12/23, 7:31 pm - +263 78 838 3513: Okay sir, I understand
04/12/23, 7:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
04/12/23, 7:56 pm - +263 78 838 3513: Yes sir,it's clear
04/12/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
04/12/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
04/12/23, 8:38 pm - +263 78 838 3513: Yes sir I'm following
04/12/23, 8:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
04/12/23, 8:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
04/12/23, 8:48 pm - +263 78 838 3513: Okay sir thank you very much
04/12/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?

14/12/23, 5:47 pm - +263 78 838 3513: Students should be teachable and open-minded.

 This means that students should be willing to learn new things and be open to new ideas. They should be willing to try new things and take risks, and they should be willing to accept feedback and constructive criticism. In order to truly learn and grow, it's important for students to be open-minded and receptive to new information and ideas.
14/12/23, 5:49 pm - +263 78 838 3513: Students should follow Edoofa's instructions.

 This means that students should respect the rules and regulations of Edoofa, and they should be willing to follow their guidelines and procedures. This includes things like attending classes on time, completing assignments, and following the instructions of teachers and staff.
14/12/23, 5:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
14/12/23, 5:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
14/12/23, 5:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identifying reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
14/12/23, 5:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
14/12/23, 5:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
14/12/23, 8:20 pm - +263 78 838 3513: Edoofa makes education affordable for students.

This means that Edoofa offers a variety of financial assistance options to help make education more accessible and affordable for students. This includes things like scholarships, grants, and payment plans. Edoofa understands that cost can be a barrier to education, and they are working to make sure that everyone has access to the education they need and deserve.
14/12/23, 8:39 pm - +263 78 838 3513: Edoofa makes students employable through the SEELS program.

SEELS stands for "Skills for Effective Employment and Life Success," and it's a program that Edoofa offers to help students develop the skills they need to be successful in their careers. This includes things like communication, teamwork, and problem-solving skills.
14/12/23, 8:40 pm - +263 78 838 3513: Yes sir, I really agree with all of this

21/12/23, 3:05 pm - +263 78 838 3513: 2.Please elaborate on the difference between Rights and Duties and give a further
explanation of the difference in Human Rights and Civil Rights.


The difference between rights and duties is that rights are freedoms or entitlements that a person has, while duties are obligations or responsibilities that a person has. Rights are often legally protected, while duties may not be. Human rights are the basic rights and freedoms that all humans are entitled to, regardless of their nationality, race, gender, or other factors. Civil rights are the specific rights and freedoms that are guaranteed by the laws of a country, such as the right to vote, the right to due process, and the right to equal protection under the law. 

Furthermore,Rights are the freedoms that a person has, while duties are the obligations that a person has. Rights are about what a person can do, while duties are about what a person must do. Rights are often seen as "positive" entitlements, while duties are seen as "negative" obligations.
Rights are often seen as legally enforceable, while duties may be seen as more moral or ethical obligations. For example, the right to free speech is a legal right that is protected by law.


To elaborate further, human rights are based on the idea that all people are entitled to certain basic freedoms, such as the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. These rights are often enshrined in national constitutions and international treaties, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Civil rights, on the other hand, are those that are specific to a particular country or region, and may not be as widely recognized. For example, the right to vote is a civil right in many countries, but it is not a human right that is recognized by all nations.

However, Rights are freedoms that a person has, while duties are obligations that a person has. The two are often intertwined, with rights giving people the freedom to do what they want, and duties giving people the responsibility to use that freedom in a way that benefits everyone. The concept of rights and duties can vary depending on the context, but they are always about balancing the needs and interests of individuals and the wider society. 

To put it simply, rights and duties are two sides of the same coin. Without rights, people would not have the freedom to pursue their own interests. Without duties, there would be no social order or protection for the weak and vulnerable. They go hand in hand, and both are necessary for a just and functioning society. It's important to remember that the exact nature of rights and duties may vary depending on the society and context, but the underlying principle remains the same. 

To conclude,There are many difference between rights and duties. One cannot turn a blind eye on some similarities of rights and duties.
21/12/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 838 3513: 4.Which branch of law are you most interested in pursuing, Civil, Corporate or Criminal,
and why?


Reasons to prefer criminal law is that it can be seen as a more "pure" form of law, since it's focused on protecting the public interest. Criminal law also has a clear and well-defined structure, with clear rules and procedures. Criminal law also offers the chance to see justice served and wrongs made right. Finally, it's a challenging and engaging area of law, with plenty of opportunities for growth and development.

Criminal law has a clear and well-defined structure. There are established rules and procedures that must be followed in every case. For example, there are strict rules about what evidence can be used, and how it must be presented. There are also clear guidelines for how the prosecution and defense must behave, and what they are allowed to do. This structure ensures that everyone is treated fairly and has the same rights and protections. It also makes the process more transparent and understandable for everyone involved. 

Seeing justice served is one of the most satisfying parts of working in criminal law. When someone has broken the law and caused harm, it can be very gratifying to see them held accountable and punished for their actions. This is especially true when the victim is able to see justice served, and they can feel some sense of closure 
and healing. Even if the criminal justice system isn't perfect, it can still be very meaningful to see it working to make things right.

Moreso,When we talk about "wrong made right" in criminal law, we're referring to the idea of "restorative justice". This is a concept that focuses on repairing the harm that has been done, rather than just punishing the offender. For example, a victim of a crime may be able to receive compensation for their losses, or the offender may be required to do community service or other forms of restitution. In this way, the wrong can be made right in a way that goes beyond simply locking someone .

Criminal law is designed to treat everyone fairly and equally, regardless of their background or status. This is known as the principle of "equality before the law". Under this principle, everyone is entitled to the same rights and protections, and they should be treated in the same way by the criminal justice system. This means that rich and poor, famous and unknown, powerful and powerless, should all be treated equally. For example, everyone has the right to a fair trial, the right to an attorney, and the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.

In conclusion, criminal law is an important part of the legal system, and it has many benefits. It provides a way to hold people accountable for breaking the law, it can make victims feel better by seeing justice served, and it treats everyone fairly and equally. Criminal law is an ever-evolving field, and it will continue to play a crucial role in society.
21/12/23, 4:04 pm - +263 78 838 3513: 3.What is the difference between a prosecutor and an attorney
There are several differences between a prosecutor and an attorney. A prosecutor is a lawyer who works for the government, and their job is to bring criminal charges against people accused of crimes. An attorney, on the other hand, is a lawyer who can represent people in any legal matter, including both criminal and civil cases. In addition, prosecutors only represent the state, while attorneys can represent individuals, businesses, or organizations. Prosecutors also have the power to decide whether to bring charges against someone, while attorneys do not have that power. 

In addition, There are several other differences between prosecutors and attorneys. Prosecutors are often salaried government employees, while attorneys can be private practitioners or work for firms. Prosecutors typically have a lot of experience with the criminal justice system, while attorneys may specialize in other areas of the law. Finally, prosecutors are usually bound by ethical rules and laws that prevent them from disclosing certain information about their cases, while attorneys are not always subject to the same restrictions.

Furthermore, some of different roles of prosecutors and attorneys, we can explore that as well. As mentioned before, prosecutors work for the government and bring criminal charges against people. They also work with law enforcement to investigate crimes, and they make decisions about whether to offer a plea deal or go to trial. Attorneys, on the other hand, can represent either the prosecution or the defense in a case. They interview witnesses, prepare evidence, and make arguments on behalf of their clients. In this way, prosecutors and attorneys have complementary but different roles in the criminal justice system. 

Moreso, There are different types of attorneys. First, there are civil attorneys, who handle disputes between individuals or businesses. Then, there are criminal defense attorneys, who represent people who have been accused of a crime. There are also family law attorneys, who specialize in matters like divorce, child custody, and adoption. And there are also personal injury attorneys, who handle cases involving injuries that people have suffered. There are many more types of attorneys, but these are some of the most common.

Appart from the above , there are also some similarities between prosecutors and attorneys. For example, both types of lawyers are required to have a law degree, and both must pass a bar exam. Both types of lawyers must also adhere to ethical standards of conduct, such as confidentiality and honesty. Additionally, both prosecutors and attorneys must have strong research, writing, and communication skills. And finally, both types of lawyers must be prepared to argue their cases in court if necessary. 

In conclusion, both prosecutors and attorneys play crucial roles in our legal system. Prosecutors enforce the law and hold people accountable for breaking it, while attorneys represent and advocate for their clients. While there are some similarities between the two professions, there are also many important differences. These differences reflect the different roles that prosecutors and attorneys play in our society. It's important to understand these differences in order to appreciate the complexity of our legal system.

This means that rich and poor, famous and unknown, powerful and powerless, should all be treated equally. For example, everyone has the right to a fair trial, the right to an attorney, and the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.

In conclusion, criminal law is an important part of the legal system, and it has many benefits. It provides a way to hold people accountable for breaking the law, it can make victims feel better by seeing justice served, and it treats everyone fairly and equally. Criminal law is an ever-evolving field, and it will continue to play a crucial role in society.
