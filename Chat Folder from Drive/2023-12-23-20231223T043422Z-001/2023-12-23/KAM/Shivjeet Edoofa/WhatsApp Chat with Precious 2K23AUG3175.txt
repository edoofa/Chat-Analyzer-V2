For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
07/09/23, 3:11 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Yes we can Start
07/09/23, 3:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/09/23, 3:13 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: I have gone through the admission cycle so now you can start explaining everything in details please
07/09/23, 3:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
07/09/23, 3:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
07/09/23, 3:37 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Very clear
07/09/23, 4:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
07/09/23, 4:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
07/09/23, 4:25 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Yes I am following and we are on the same chapter sir
07/09/23, 4:25 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: When will the counselling session occur
07/09/23, 4:25 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: ??
07/09/23, 7:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening, Kindly excuse me for the delay in responding; our availability for the first slot has just concluded.
07/09/23, 7:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the concern with me. With pure consistency in our session, it will take place within 3 days, dear. May I know if we are on the same page?
07/09/23, 7:45 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Yes we are
07/09/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
07/09/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
07/09/23, 9:21 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Yes we are clear but then didn't we already pay for the admission or this payment of the registration fee is another one???
07/09/23, 9:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The University Registration Fee, ranging from $500 to $750, constitutes a component of your total university tuition fees. This fee is necessary to secure your seat at the university and is required to be paid before the start of your session while you are at your home, by the student/parent/guardian. It's important to understand that this amount is not an additional charge, it will be subtracted from your first year's tuition fees. I hope we are on the same page here?
07/09/23, 9:52 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Yes we are
07/09/23, 10:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
07/09/23, 10:03 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Yes sir let's start this admission journey.
07/09/23, 10:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
07/09/23, 10:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
07/09/23, 10:13 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Yes can and please do share the videos
07/09/23, 10:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it has been a long day for me, and our available hours are coming to an end, I would like to reconnect tomorrow and continue with our session. I hope you have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
07/09/23, 10:26 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Goodnight sir and your regards to my family are warmly received with appreciation.
07/09/23, 10:50 pm - +265 999 91 71 64: Thank you for walking with Preciois through the steps. Be assured of our support and commitment.

08/09/23, 3:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding.

11/09/23, 10:11 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Important message to the enrolled students 
This video is talking about that the students that have been found eligible should be teachable and well open minded for the best experience of the Edoofa Program for them to visualise what they want to pursue. they also have to follow instructions  because the instructions act as a guiding point for them  to  be on the same route with the Program. 

The Edoofa's vision for you it is giving a learning about the edoofa is not just to get students affordable quality education and making students employable through  Students of Edoofa's Earning and learning to success,but it also focuses on increasing students capacity for success thus making students more responsible and independent and they put students in a community to share their experience about the Edoofa program hence gives them  guide ,mentor and show path of success. 

The third video is about schools,colleges and universities under the Edoofa Program. This makes sure that students understand that edoofa has invested alot of time to Identify good schools,  colleges and universities for passionate edoofians. Founders encourage students to follow instructions so as to prepare and be qualified for these prestigious institutions. The last video  which Is the preparation of the interactive session with schools statement of purpose. 

The statement of purpose  is the important document that's students should be prompt in taking action and be diligent in filling out the form. It actually requires several aspects like the reason why you chose the  course you want to purse, the vision you have on the course and after the course, explaining about your admission officer and how you interacted this aspects can make you get full scholarship under the Edoofian program. <This message was edited>
11/09/23, 10:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
11/09/23, 10:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
11/09/23, 10:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
11/09/23, 10:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
11/09/23, 10:19 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Yes we are on the same page
12/09/23, 2:42 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Good afternoon. 
Yes am available to proceed further with our session
12/09/23, 3:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, . Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
12/09/23, 3:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 1:30 PM.
12/09/23, 3:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

Primary Memory (RAM -Random Access Memory)
Primary memory, often referred to as RAM, is a volatile and temporary form of storage used by a computer to hold data that is actively being used . it's examples include DDR4 RAM in a laptop, smartphone RAM.

Secondary Memory (Hard Drive, SSD, External Drives, etc.)Secondary memory is non-volatile, Memory's storage used to store data and programs even when the computer is turned off. It's examples hard disk drive, USB flash drive
13/09/23, 9:23 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: 3.The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or networking system into seven distinct layers. 

1. Physical Layer: This is the lowest layer and deals with the physical medium and transmission of raw bits over a physical connection. It includes specifications for cables, connectors, and network devices like switches and hubs. 

2. Data Link Layer: This layer is responsible for creating a reliable link between two directly connected nodes over a shared medium. It also handles error detection and correction. Ethernet and MAC addresses are part of this layer. 

3. Network Layer: The network layer manages the routing of data packets between different networks. It deals with logical addressing (like IP addresses), packet forwarding, and routing. Routers operate at this layer. 

4. Transport Layer: The transport layer ensures end-to-end communication, error recovery, and data integrity between devices. It establishes connections, manages flow control, and can provide error correction. Protocols like TCP and UDP operate at this layer. 

5. Session Layer: This layer manages the establishment, maintenance, and termination of sessions or connections between applications on different devices. It also deals with synchronization and dialog control. 

6. Presentation Layer:Responsible for data translation, compression, and encryption. It ensures that data sent from the application layer on one device can be properly interpreted by the application layer on another device. 

7. Application Layer :This is the top layer and is closest to the end-users. It provides various network services directly to applications, including email, file transfer, and remote access. Protocols like HTTP, FTP, and SMTP operate at this layer. 

The OSI model serves as a reference point for understanding network protocols and interactions. In practice, the TCP/IP model is more commonly used, which is a simplified version of the OSI model with fewer layers, but it's important to have a conceptual understanding of both models in networking

04/10/23, 4:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon,

*When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it. -Henry Ford*

With that cheerful note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

May I know if you are currently available at the moment to proceed with the session?
04/10/23, 5:55 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Yes am available and ready for the admission process
04/10/23, 6:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As we wait for the documents shall we move on with the session for the admission process?
04/10/23, 6:27 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Yes we can move on with the admission office
04/10/23, 6:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Computer Science Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
04/10/23, 6:39 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Yes very accurate
04/10/23, 8:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
04/10/23, 8:25 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Yes am ready since am eager to know the university am going to
04/10/23, 8:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
04/10/23, 8:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter
04/10/23, 8:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
04/10/23, 8:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
04/10/23, 8:35 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Yes it's impossible
04/10/23, 9:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
04/10/23, 9:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
04/10/23, 9:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
04/10/23, 9:17 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Yes
04/10/23, 9:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sorry to say that I will not be further available to proceed with our session for now, as unforeseen work has come up that requires my assistance. Let us connect tomorrow evening at 5:00 PM. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
04/10/23, 9:48 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Goodnight
05/10/23, 5:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and My dear student. 

How are you doing this lovely afternoon?
05/10/23, 5:10 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Good Afternoon, am doing  just fine how about you
05/10/23, 5:23 pm - +265 999 91 71 64: Good afternoon
05/10/23, 5:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am doing well too, thank you for asking. If you are ready, shall we proceed with the session?
05/10/23, 5:33 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Yes we can
05/10/23, 5:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
05/10/23, 5:50 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Yes we are
05/10/23, 6:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
05/10/23, 6:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
05/10/23, 6:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
05/10/23, 6:10 pm - +265 999 91 71 64: Following
05/10/23, 6:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
05/10/23, 6:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
05/10/23, 6:24 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: alright
05/10/23, 6:25 pm - +265 999 91 71 64: Sounds better
05/10/23, 7:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
05/10/23, 7:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
05/10/23, 7:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
05/10/23, 7:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
05/10/23, 7:28 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Am quite ok with it
05/10/23, 7:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have completely understood the admission process. In the meantime, we will focus on your admission journey. Now that you have a clear understanding of the admission process, I encourage you to have a discussion with your family regarding the financial requirements. This will allow them to plan effectively and move in the right direction.
05/10/23, 7:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Given that your university admission is scheduled for the August 2024 intake, our next step is to reconnect with you and discuss when to commence the same journey. 

We have scheduled our session for Tomorrow at 3:00 p.m. to begin the admission process. Please ensure that both you and your parents are available for this session. We understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise, and if, for any reason, you or your parents cannot connect as planned, kindly inform us in advance.
05/10/23, 7:31 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Alright will inform you
07/10/23, 11:41 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and my dear Edoofian.

I trust this message finds you in good health. Unfortunately, I experienced a lack of response from your end during our recent attempts at communication. Nevertheless, I remain committed to our discussion and sincerely wish to proceed.

To accommodate our conversation, I propose we meet at 3:00 PM on Monday. I hope this timing works well for you.

Wishing you a wonderful week ahead, and please convey my warm regards to your lovely family.
07/10/23, 11:43 am - +265 991 56 81 24: Thank you
07/10/23, 3:37 pm - +265 999 91 71 64: Oh apologises, 
Let's communicate on Monday then.
Good evening
09/10/23, 3:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and My dear student. 

I trust you had a restful weekend with your family. May I kindly inquire if you are presently available to continue with our session?
09/10/23, 3:36 pm - +265 999 91 71 64: Good afternoon to you
09/10/23, 3:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I kindly inquire if you are presently available to continue with our session?
09/10/23, 3:42 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Yes I am available we can continue with the session
09/10/23, 3:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
09/10/23, 3:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
09/10/23, 3:46 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Am really looking forward to the offer letter
09/10/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
09/10/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/10/23, 3:59 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Yes I will secure the scholarship seat
09/10/23, 4:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
09/10/23, 4:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
09/10/23, 4:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
09/10/23, 4:03 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Yes I am
09/10/23, 4:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
09/10/23, 4:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
09/10/23, 4:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
09/10/23, 4:15 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: I have reviewed
09/10/23, 4:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
09/10/23, 4:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of Blessing's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete her registration formalities, you will be presented with her Official Admission Letter with the help of which she will be able to apply for the student visa.
09/10/23, 4:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Blessing, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing her seat before the competition even begins. She will be the trailblazer among her peers, firmly positioning her as a frontiersperson in this endeavor.
09/10/23, 4:26 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Alright
09/10/23, 4:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
09/10/23, 4:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
09/10/23, 4:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/10/23, 4:43 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Yes it does
09/10/23, 4:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
09/10/23, 4:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/10/23, 4:54 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Yes it does. But why does edoofa cover the $150 instead of $600
09/10/23, 4:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great question. The reason Edoofa covers the $150 instead of the full $600 is strategic and aligned with our goal to support our students effectively.

The $150 represents an upfront financial benefit to the student, helping to alleviate the initial financial burden associated with the registration fee. By covering this portion, Edoofa aims to facilitate a smoother transition for students into the university enrollment process.
09/10/23, 5:09 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Alright
09/10/23, 5:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: if you are clear shall we proceed with the session?
09/10/23, 5:14 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Yes let's proceed
09/10/23, 5:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
09/10/23, 5:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
09/10/23, 5:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
09/10/23, 5:20 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Yes I'm following

09/10/23, 5:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
09/10/23, 5:24 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: I need a little information on it
09/10/23, 5:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
09/10/23, 5:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
09/10/23, 5:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
09/10/23, 5:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
09/10/23, 5:28 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Alright
09/10/23, 5:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
09/10/23, 5:31 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Yes I agree
09/10/23, 5:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
09/10/23, 5:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
09/10/23, 5:35 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Yes I am clear
09/10/23, 5:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
09/10/23, 5:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
09/10/23, 5:41 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: So when you want to pursue a degree in another country does that mean you are enrolled out of the Edoofa Program
09/10/23, 5:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that's correct. When you choose to pursue a degree in another country outside of India, you will essentially be stepping out of the Edoofa Program. The Edoofa Scholarship Program specifically applies to universities and colleges in India. If you opt for a degree course in a different country, you would no longer be eligible for the benefits and scholarship under the Edoofa Program.
09/10/23, 5:49 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Oh alright I get it
09/10/23, 5:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
09/10/23, 5:57 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Alright understood
09/10/23, 5:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
09/10/23, 6:07 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: No question
09/10/23, 6:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
09/10/23, 6:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
09/10/23, 6:24 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Yes am really looking forward
09/10/23, 6:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for your application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
09/10/23, 6:34 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Alright
09/10/23, 10:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As I was  going through our chats I have noticed that there was a lack of the documents that we have discussed. So May I know by when you might be able to share the documents with me ?
09/10/23, 10:37 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: The documents are still process sir because on the national ID  it takes much time while the recommendation letter maybe collected soon enough
11/10/23, 5:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if there is any recent update regarding the documents?
11/10/23, 5:37 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: I have the MSCE Notification but still waiting on the school recommendation letter
11/10/23, 5:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, Please do share all the documents when you have them.
11/10/23, 5:51 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Alright will do so
23/10/23, 8:20 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Precious!

I hope you are doing well as we approach a fresh new weekend. I was hoping for a response from your end regarding the documents. It seems that my previous message was unattended. If there is any update on the documents please do give us a reply for the same so that we can share your documents with the university officials for your scholarship application.
23/10/23, 8:24 am - +265 999 91 71 64: Good morning, 
Apologies for the non responseveness to the earlier message.
The documentation is being worked on as it involves government offices and they also need to verify some of the details before they proceed with issuance.
