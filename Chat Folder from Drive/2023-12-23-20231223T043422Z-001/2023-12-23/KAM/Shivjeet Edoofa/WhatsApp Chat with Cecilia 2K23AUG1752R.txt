Also,Edoofa does not only offer an opportunity to further my studies only ,but I also have the necessary skill to be an effective employee if any,hence the Edoofa Scholarship program ensures employability in the world and in practice.The Earn While You Learn programs and tasks under Edoofa give room to offer my contribution towards my tuition ,all through hard work and dedication. 
However ,not only does the Scholarship equip me with technical skills ,but also I feel the whole atmosphere mentally prepares me to conquer what ever the world throws at me and learn to be independent .The exposure to many opportunities through the EWYL program and appreciation of my talent really urge me to positively work twice as hard for the best.

For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
04/09/23, 9:13 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Noted sir.We may proceed.
04/09/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/09/23, 9:43 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Okay sir
04/09/23, 9:44 pm - +263 77 911 5643: We may proceed sir,please explain.
04/09/23, 10:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
04/09/23, 10:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
04/09/23, 10:19 pm - +263 77 911 5643: The steps are clear sir.
04/09/23, 10:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
04/09/23, 10:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
04/09/23, 10:38 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Im following sir
05/09/23, 12:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Cecilia.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further yesterday, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
05/09/23, 12:20 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Afternoon. We may safely proceed with the session sir.
05/09/23, 2:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
05/09/23, 2:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
05/09/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 911 5643: The details are clear sir.
05/09/23, 4:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
05/09/23, 4:34 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Noted,thank you sir.
05/09/23, 5:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
05/09/23, 7:38 pm - +263 77 911 5643: May I be pardoned for the delayed response sir.May we  commence with the first step.
05/09/23, 8:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
05/09/23, 8:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.

*When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it. -Henry Ford*

With the positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you all ready?
06/09/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Good afternoon sir.Thank you for the empowering qoute.We may start the session.
06/09/23, 3:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. May I know if you were able to watch the videos that were shared with you the previous day?
06/09/23, 5:21 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Evening sir.
06/09/23, 5:24 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Unfortunately, network has not permitted me to view the videos as they partially download.I've been trying and have not given up on downloading the videos
06/09/23, 8:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the late reply our first slot of the day had just ended. I understand your challenges, please let me know when you have watched the videos so that we could proceed further with your session.
06/09/23, 8:28 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Thank you for understanding sir.
07/09/23, 10:04 am - +263 77 911 5643: Good day sir.
07/09/23, 10:07 am - +263 77 911 5643: In the video,I understood that Edoofa's vision for its students is the creation on affordable education in shaping skill and equipped personnel who are employable and are able to do the practical part of what they learn .The video did help shed light and was clear and up to my understanding. Thank you for sharing.
07/09/23, 10:29 am - +263 77 911 5643: In this video, I felt intrigued to take on university under Edoofa.I understood that immense effort is invested in concluding a university as suitable to accommodate a student while getting the best of education. All universities that work with Edoofa have the Earn While You Learn program that is meant to refine the attitude of the student and mentally prepare and enable the student to function properly in the business world ,hence the Edoofa triangle .Also ,although culture may be diverse ,Edoofa ensures that there is non discrimination of any culture or prohibition in celebrating along with the world in any way hence students are able to incorporate learning or education with friendship.I believe a community where there is peace of mind and togetherness is simply the best atmosphere for a focused mind to begin with. The video helped me a lot in having a sketch of what the universities would be like and how settling in any of the universities is not a hard task.
07/09/23, 10:34 am - +263 77 911 5643: In this video, I understood of the beauty in learning from an expert and the beauty of asking for help as a guideline.Better and greater outcomes are possible. I appreciate the existence of the Edoofa family as I feel my academic route will not be a lonely or hard one, but I have people to guide me through every chapter.Thank you.
07/09/23, 11:09 am - +263 77 911 5643: In this video,I understood the importance of the Statement of Purpose.Not only does it help the universities decide why they have to consider one as their student ,but also the SOP's give the student a guideline and understanding as yo why they would venture in that particular journey of their academic route. A goal driven individual knows just the right step to take to enable the birth of their goal to reality.
07/09/23, 11:10 am - +263 77 911 5643: I have no queries so far as I have understood the purpose of every step covered in the videos I had been tasked to watch.Thank you for the insight sir.
07/09/23, 4:01 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Good afternoon sir
07/09/23, 4:01 pm - +263 77 911 5643: May we please proceed with our session.
07/09/23, 7:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening, Kindly excuse me for the delay in responding; our availability for the first slot has just concluded.
07/09/23, 7:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
07/09/23, 7:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
07/09/23, 7:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
07/09/23, 7:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
07/09/23, 7:43 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Good evening sir
07/09/23, 7:43 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Thank you for engaging on my response and understanding of the videos.We are on the same page hence we may safely proceed to the next step sir.
07/09/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, . Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
07/09/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 1:30 PM.
07/09/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

07/09/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/09/23, 9:27 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Okay,well noted.Thank you sir
08/09/23, 2:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Cecilia. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. May I know if you were able to complete the above tasks
08/09/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Good afternoon Sir.
08/09/23, 2:17 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Yes I was able to,the feed back is coming ryt up
08/09/23, 2:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that, I shall wait for the same.
08/09/23, 4:46 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Question 2.

Firstly,medical  laboratory technology is the science of  analysing varying specimen such as blood samples,body fluids  and tissues .Through such analysis, a medical lab scientist is able to detect,analyse and find remedy of diseases. Test results may also be relayed to physicians and may be used in the detection of  diseases such as cancer while incorporating with the theoretical aspect of study. Medical lab technologists play a major role in the effective diagnosis and treatment of patients and have to work hand in glove with doctors  to make it possible to produce results to the patients ,enabling their treatment.

The importance of Medical Lab Technology is undoubtedly in its major role of existence. Collection of specimen to be analysed is done when there is need.For example,specimen to be analysed may be collected from a crime scene such as rape or murder .The results from the analysis of the specimen help investigators in identifying perpetrators to victims,hence investigations are solved in this manner. Also ,analysis of blood samples for example is used in determining the paternity  of an individual .The diversity of diet and allergic reactions towards different food substances may result in food poisoning .Analysis of body fluids in medical labs help in shedding light on cases of food poisoning.
08/09/23, 4:56 pm - +263 77 911 5643: 3.Good Laboratory Practices are principles that follow a certain criteria concerned with environmental safety and accuracy of the  processes of analysis of samples in labs with  the necessity of accurate planning ,performance,monitoring of the processes done in order to obtain accurate results. Good Laboratory Practices enable the accurate collection and verification of laboratory data in ensuring quality control of the final product. In simpler terms GLP enables one to attain quality results of high accuracy.
GLP has specific requirements that help in attaining quality results .The requirements include resources ,rules characterisation, etcetera .GLP demand that all testing should be carried out in a lab that is specifically designated for the purpose. The atmosphere should be at correct temperatures and the surfaces should be non  contaminated before and after testing is carried out.
08/09/23, 4:56 pm - +263 77 911 5643: GLP is carried out in the lab to prevent distortion of results after analysis and also improve the quality and accuracy of results .
08/09/23, 4:58 pm - +263 77 911 5643: 4.Sterilization methods in the lab include heating,irradiation, use of chemicals,high pressure and filtration. Sterilization methods are applied in labs so as to eliminate all forms of life present that may result in biasness of results. Other methods that can be applied include ultraviolet radiation ,use of chlorine dioxide gas and gas vapour sterilants.Chemical sterilants that can be used can be encompassed under formaldehyde solutions and glutaraldehydes. These different methods may also be incorporated together for more effective results. Sterilization ensures that there is no possibility of transmission of infectious pathogens from medical and surgical instruments to patients. Steam Sterilization is most widely used as it is less expensive,non toxic and easily applicable.

Use of high pressure steam involves the use of  an  autoclave,a machine that kills harmful bacteria, viruses and spores on items placed on high pressure vessels.According to the materials being sterilized, the autoclave will have temperature and pressure that best suit the material being sterilized. Steam sterilization using an autoclave includes stages such as air removal,Sterilization and Cooling or drying.In air removal,air is removed from the chamber and load in the auto clave.This is done as air acts as an insulator to heat hence Sterilization would not be effective practise with rough air removal being done.Air removal may be done through steam purging or vacuum air removal.
08/09/23, 5:40 pm - +263 77 911 5643: 5.Techniques for placing samples under a microscope include the use of wet mount,dry mount,smear ,staining and squashing. The technique applied largely depends on the nature of the specimen. Dry mount is the simplest and most basic technique.A thinly sliced section is positioned at the center of the slide and a cover slip is placed over the sample.Dry mounts are mostly suitable for specimens of pollen ,feathers, hair or dry material.

In placing a slide through wet mount,a sterile dropper is used .The specimen is gently mixed in a test tube and approximately one drop is removed and placed on a clean microscope slide .A patients name or identification detail is attached on the slide. A cover slip is the placed over the sample for examination.

08/09/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It has been received. May I know if you have the statement of entry with you?
08/09/23, 9:28 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Yes I have sent the document sir
08/09/23, 9:28 pm - +263 77 911 5643: <Media omitted>
08/09/23, 9:28 pm - +263 77 911 5643: <Media omitted>
08/09/23, 9:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Medical Lab Technology) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
08/09/23, 9:40 pm - +263 77 911 5643: We can confirm the information you have as accurate Sir.
08/09/23, 9:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
08/09/23, 9:58 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Yes we may proceed with the counselling sir.
08/09/23, 9:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
08/09/23, 9:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
08/09/23, 9:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
08/09/23, 9:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
08/09/23, 10:08 pm - +263 77 911 5643: That on its own would defy logic sir.It is not possible .
08/09/23, 10:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
08/09/23, 10:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
08/09/23, 10:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
08/09/23, 10:16 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Yes he did discuss the registration fee with us during the counselling session.
08/09/23, 10:16 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Understood sir
09/09/23, 12:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you're having a wonderful afternoon. I apologize for not being able to engage further as I'm feeling a bit under the weather. 

As the weekend is approaching, let's plan to reconvene on Monday to continue our session. I wish you a fantastic weekend, and please convey my warm regards to your lovely family.
09/09/23, 12:45 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Good day sir.Thank you for the update.I wish you a great weekend as well.We shall continue on Monday.
11/09/23, 1:22 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Good afternoon honourables ,I hope you all are doing well and had a wonderful weekend. May you have a fantastic week as well.
11/09/23, 8:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Cecilia.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you on time.

Please let me know if you are available so we can proceed further with our session?
11/09/23, 8:22 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Evening Sir. We may proceed with today's session.
11/09/23, 10:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
11/09/23, 10:28 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Understood sir,we are on the same page.
12/09/23, 12:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: "Good Afternoon Parents and Cecilia

Now that you have taken a step forward for your dream of education abroad and are working hard to prepare for your higher educational finances, we would be helping you initiate your EWYL Program so that you can utilize the next few months wisely and prepare for your journey to India.

To commence your EWYL Program, your dedicated mentor has created a group with the name *Cecilia EWYL23E0615*. You along with your parents/guardian/sponsor will have to join your group using the below link.

Group Link: https://chat.whatsapp.com/HSOjGnTLUjSEsXEYBisTt6"
12/09/23, 12:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you and your parents have joined the group. please send the following message to the group - *Dear Mentor, my name is Cecilia Princess Dube and my EWYL group name is Cecilia EWYL23E0615.* I have completed my counseling session with the admissions team and now I am ready to start with my EWYL journey as well.
12/09/23, 12:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: "Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

Hello Admission officer, I have started my EWYL journey and my mentor is Mr./Ms. __"
12/09/23, 2:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
12/09/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Yes ,we may safely proceed Sir.
12/09/23, 3:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
12/09/23, 3:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
12/09/23, 3:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken a note of this example for the fee breakup?
12/09/23, 6:58 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Yes I have sir.
12/09/23, 7:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, Kindly excuse me for the late reply, our available hours for the first slot have just ended.
12/09/23, 7:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
12/09/23, 7:53 pm - +263 77 911 5643: I understand the details entailed by the example sir.
12/09/23, 8:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, Kindly excuse me for the late reply, our available hours for the first slot have just ended.
12/09/23, 8:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
12/09/23, 8:24 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Noted sir
12/09/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
12/09/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
12/09/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
12/09/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
12/09/23, 8:35 pm - +263 77 911 5643: I have no queries Sir, we may proceed.
12/09/23, 8:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have completely understood the admission process. In the meantime, we will focus on your admission journey. Now that you have a clear understanding of the admission process, I encourage you to have a discussion with your family regarding the financial requirements. This will allow them to plan effectively and move in the right direction.
12/09/23, 8:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Given that your university admission is scheduled for the August 2024 intake, our next step is to reconnect with you and discuss when to commence the same journey. 

We have scheduled our session Tomorrow at 01:00 pm to begin the admission process. Please ensure that both you and your parents are available for this session. We understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise, and if, for any reason, you or your parents cannot connect as planned, kindly inform us in advance.
12/09/23, 9:23 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Thank you and noted sir.We will be available for the session tommorow ,thank you once again.
13/09/23, 11:46 am - +263 77 911 5643: Hello Admission officer,I have started my EWYL journey and my mentor is Ms. Aditi
13/09/23, 3:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Cecilia. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. Thank you for sharing the name of your mentor. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
13/09/23, 3:31 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Good afternoon to you too.We may proceed with the session.
13/09/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Cecilia. How are you doing this lovely evening?
13/09/23, 8:42 pm - +263 77 911 5643: We are doing well sir.How are you?
13/09/23, 8:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, I am great, thank you for asking. Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
13/09/23, 8:57 pm - +263 77 911 5643: No Sir,I do believe I need guidance on that note.Please clarify Sir.
13/09/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand, it is alright, let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.

For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
13/09/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
13/09/23, 9:08 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Thank you Sir. I am now aware of such an amazing opportunity. This would definitely relieve financial constraints for my family.
13/09/23, 9:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing to hear that, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
13/09/23, 9:09 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Yes please .I am keen to know more.
13/09/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
13/09/23, 9:30 pm - +263 77 911 5643: I was not aware of that sir.
13/09/23, 9:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:
13/09/23, 9:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.

3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
13/09/23, 9:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, choosing the early decision benefits brings two additional advantages:

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.

*The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program*
13/09/23, 9:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through these benefits so that we can discuss all of them one by one.
13/09/23, 9:44 pm - +263 77 911 5643: I am in that process Sir.
13/09/23, 9:54 pm - +263 77 911 5643: We may proceed with the discussion sir.
13/09/23, 9:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
13/09/23, 9:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. As you await your A-Level results, initiating the university admission process now positions you as an early applicant. This status comes with the advantage of receiving a provisional letter of intent from the university. This letter will outline your scholarship percentage and associated fees. Once you complete your registration formalities and your results are available, you'll be provided with your Official Admission Letter. This letter will enable you to proceed with your student visa application. I trust this point is now clear to you.
13/09/23, 10:04 pm - +263 77 911 5643: It is clear sir.I fully understand the first benefit
14/09/23, 1:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Cecilia.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further yesterday, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out.

Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
14/09/23, 3:39 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Good afternoon sir.May I be pardoned to the late response.Network has not been at its best Sir.We may proceed with the session.
14/09/23, 8:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, Kindly excuse me for the late reply, our available hours for the first slot have just ended and I was occupied with a meeting. Shall we proceed with the session?
14/09/23, 8:52 pm - +263 77 911 5643: We may proceed Sir.
14/09/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
14/09/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Students now have the reamrkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This can be achieved by making an early decision to initiate the university admission process and securing your seat in advance. By taking this step, you can avail the early decision benefits previously mentioned. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
14/09/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/09/23, 9:10 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Yes it does ,I am most grateful for being able to access such benefits Sir.
14/09/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
14/09/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be skillfully adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/09/23, 9:42 pm - +263 77 911 5643: I understand what is implied by the explanation Sir.
14/09/23, 9:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, we're offering the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
14/09/23, 9:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
14/09/23, 9:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 18, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 18, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 18, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
14/09/23, 10:04 pm - +263 77 911 5643: I have non to enquire about at the moment Sir. The examples give clear detail.
14/09/23, 10:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
14/09/23, 10:08 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Please,kindly guide me through the process Sir.
14/09/23, 10:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student decides to initiate their admission process before receiving their A-Level results, they gain the advantage of early registration benefits. At this stage, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from entities like Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship percentage as promised.
14/09/23, 10:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there might be a scenario where the student might not achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels. 

In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship. However, if a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university with early decision benefits, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged.
14/09/23, 10:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On the other hand, if a student manages to achieve a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application once the results are available. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how this gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process as per the standard procedures?
14/09/23, 10:41 pm - +263 77 911 5643: I understand the benefits of performing very well in my Advanced level amongst others. Thank you sir.
14/09/23, 10:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
14/09/23, 10:45 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Most definitely Sir,that would be a dead end.
14/09/23, 10:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
14/09/23, 10:52 pm - +263 77 911 5643: I agree
14/09/23, 10:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
14/09/23, 10:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the early decision benefits, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for  another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
14/09/23, 10:54 pm - +263 77 911 5643: I am clear about the solution.Well understood.
14/09/23, 10:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
14/09/23, 10:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
14/09/23, 11:01 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Sir ,pursuing the diploma will be possible being part of the Edoofa Scholarship program ?May I get clarity please.
14/09/23, 11:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, it is possible, in fact, we will help you find and secure the diploma course as well.
14/09/23, 11:04 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Okay.When pursuing ones bachelor education under Edoofa Scholarship program, is a reapplication required ?
15/09/23, 6:29 pm - +263 77 993 4323: However, there's a June Exams option
15/09/23, 6:30 pm - +263 77 993 4323: June exams results get published before or during early August
15/09/23, 7:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents Cecilia. I hope you are well and blessed. May I know if you are ready to further proceed with the session?
15/09/23, 7:36 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Good evening Sir.We may proceed with today's session.
15/09/23, 7:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Regarding your previous question. If the applicant is new a reapplication would be required but if you wanted to change the course (if eligible) you will not be charged for a reapplication. May I know if you are clear here?
15/09/23, 7:59 pm - +263 77 911 5643: I understand sir.
15/09/23, 8:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
15/09/23, 8:30 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Okay Sir,if I may know,The EWYL program would be done while one is still in their home country.
15/09/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, indeed.
15/09/23, 9:51 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Okay thank you sir
15/09/23, 9:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through all 7 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 7 points clear?
15/09/23, 9:59 pm - +263 77 911 5643: We may proceed .I'm satisfied and have no queries Sir.
15/09/23, 10:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
15/09/23, 10:26 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Yes,that's correct.
15/09/23, 10:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
15/09/23, 10:30 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Yes ,that would be all left Sir.
15/09/23, 10:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Indeed. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then. <This message was edited>

18/09/23, 10:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Since it is late and it has been a long day for me, and the available hours are coming to an end, we shall proceed with our session tomorrow afternoon at 3:00 PM. I hope this works for you, and have a great night.

19/09/23, 6:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Cecilia,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. I was not able to connect with you at our scheduled time as I was occupied with retrieving our proud Edooﬁans from the airport. I would like to share a glimpse of this experience with my students. Along with that, I would like to reschedule our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM. I hope this timing works for you. Have a great day!
19/09/23, 6:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 7:23 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Evening Sir.Congratulations to our fellow Edoofian members for making it this far.I am most glad and inspired to work hard enough to be able to make it that far.Once again ,congratulations and I wish you all the best in this academic journey.
20/09/23, 2:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon! I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. How are you enjoying this lovely afternoon?
20/09/23, 5:01 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Afternoon.If not for the hot, weather my afternoon would have been fantastic.How are you doing Sir?
20/09/23, 5:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm doing wonderfully, thank you for inquiring. Are you prepared and ready for our session?
20/09/23, 5:05 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Yes I am Sir.May we begin the session.
20/09/23, 5:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm pleased to learn that. I'm interested in knowing whether you've had the opportunity to engage in a conversation regarding the advantages of early decision, as we touched upon the previous day.. <This message was edited>
20/09/23, 5:15 pm - +263 77 911 5643: We have had the conversation Sir and we totally understand the advantages of early decision making.
20/09/23, 5:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I would be pleased if you let me know how was the discussion on the Early Decision Benefits and what was your thoughts by your parents?
20/09/23, 5:46 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Honestly,the discussion was fruitful Sir .We came to an understanding of what is happening all around us in the scenario of West African countries being at an advantage , thanks to you,our side of Africa is also catered for .The Edoofian family is highly considerate and non discriminatory.My parents understood what the options in my academic journey and motivated me to work hard to avoid options that put en end to my academic journey .my parents also think that it is better to make decisions early for the better and are motivated to work twice as hard in securing all funds necessary . It is a once in a lifetime opportunity.
20/09/23, 5:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's wonderful to hear! I'm pleased that the discussion was fruitful and that your family has a clear understanding of the advantages of early decision making. It's indeed essential to make informed decisions early on to secure the best possible opportunities for your academic journey. The dedication and motivation from both you and your parents are commendable.
20/09/23, 5:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now before we move forward and have a conversation regarding the same, may I know if your parents are available with us for this session and if they have any queries that you would like to ask or any concerns that have been bothering you and you would like to share?
20/09/23, 5:55 pm - +263 77 911 5643: My parents are available Sir .There are no queries or concerns concerning the subject .
20/09/23, 5:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Great! It is good to know all of us are on the same page. I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.*
20/09/23, 5:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due date will be mentioned.
20/09/23, 5:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?*
20/09/23, 6:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was not able to connect with you today and  I'll be wrapping up our discussion for now as I need to connect with another batch of my students. To continue our conversation, I propose scheduling our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM.

Wishing you a fantastic day, and please extend my warm regards to your wonderful family too.
20/09/23, 7:01 pm - +263 77 911 5643: We understand the details in reserving a seat with the university.Thank you sir
20/09/23, 7:01 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Thank you sir.We shall connect tomorrow at the schedules time
21/09/23, 2:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, parents and my dear student.

How is your afternoon going?
21/09/23, 3:08 pm - +263 77 911 5643: God afternoon Sir.Hope you are well.If not for the hot weather,this afternoon is okay.
21/09/23, 3:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am doing well. Thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with our session for your admission process?
21/09/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Yes,we may proceed with the session Sir.
21/09/23, 3:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is amazing to hear. Alright, please. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
21/09/23, 3:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
21/09/23, 3:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
21/09/23, 5:04 pm - +263 77 911 5643: We are clear on it Sir .We fully understand the important impact that being mentally and financially prepared has on my academic journey .Thank you for sharing such important information.
21/09/23, 5:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great. Now you have two ways to proceed with your child’s university admission process -

*1. Proceed as per the standard procedures*
*2. Proceed with the Early Decision Benefits*

Be assured that I will help you understand the difference between both of them so that you can make a well-informed decision regarding your child’s university admission process. Shall we start with our discussion regarding the same?
21/09/23, 6:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was not able to connect with you today. Hence, I'll be wrapping up our discussion for now as I need to connect with another batch of my students. To continue our conversation, I propose scheduling our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM.

Wishing you a fantastic day, and please extend my warm regards to your wonderful family too.
22/09/23, 5:20 am - +263 77 911 5643: Noted Sir..Will definitely connect at that time
22/09/23, 5:21 am - ~ 🤍Kim💫 🥀 added +263 78 822 3195
22/09/23, 7:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening, dear parents and my dear student,

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you at our scheduled time today. I was currently occupied with a meeting with the admission team. So, I will connect with you on Monday at 3:00 PM. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your family as well.
23/09/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Thank you Sir.Noted
25/09/23, 5:02 am - +263 77 993 4323: <Media omitted>
25/09/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Good afternoon Sir.I hope you began your week on a lovely note!
25/09/23, 2:58 pm - +263 77 911 5643: May I be permitted to arrange with the Honorable Admission team for a timed schedule.I am at  a boarding school and I can only be allocated a specific communication time by the school as cellphones are not permitted at school.
25/09/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 911 5643: If possible,may we arrange for a session running from 2pm CAT to 4 pm CAT if possible and 6am to 7am .These hours will allow not only my parents to connect with the team but also enable me to address all that requires my full attention and participation.Thank you.
25/09/23, 3:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Cecilia. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. I have duly noted your concern. May I know if you might be available now?
25/09/23, 3:23 pm - +263 77 911 5643: Thank you Sir.I am currently available
25/09/23, 3:41 pm - +263 78 822 3195: I'm available also as the parent
25/09/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
25/09/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, let us start with the *Standard Registration/University Admission process*-

As you are aware that one’s registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university, to be on the safer side, let us assume that the registration fee is $750 itself.

As per the standard procedures, once you get the offer letter from the university, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of $750.

For example, if you get the offer letter on the 30th of September and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, the deadline for the registration fee would be the 14th of October 2023 and you would have to make the payment of the fee before then. Are you clear about this?
25/09/23, 4:34 pm - +263 78 822 3195: We are clear Sir
25/09/23, 4:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great, now let us discuss the *Early Registration/University Admission process -*

As the name states, a student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.

If you do that, you are eligible for all 6 benefits that we discussed earlier. Since the benefit number 3 and 4 helps you ease the registration process, I will be discussing the same in particular and help you understand how that happens -

When we talk about the Early Decision Grant of $150 (benefit number 3)
25/09/23, 4:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To understand the same, let us once again assume that the registration fee due is $750 and if you have a grant of $150, this means that out of the fee due of $750, $150 will be paid by the Edoofa Academic Board on your behalf and hence this leaves your child’s fee due as $750 - $150 = $600.

So, the amount that you will have to pay to reserve/lock your child’s scholarship seat becomes $600.
25/09/23, 4:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

*1. The first part ~ $300* is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 30th of September, the deadline becomes the 14th of October, 2023)

*2. The second part ~ $300* is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 30th of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 14th of October 2023, making the second deadline the 14th of November, 2023).
25/09/23, 4:49 pm - +263 78 822 3195: This is clearly layed down Honorable, I do understand
25/09/23, 5:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
25/09/23, 5:24 pm - +263 78 822 3195: I'm humbled to say I clearly understand the benefits of an early decision to reserve/ lock my  child's scholarship seat Sir, and the admission procedures are very much clear
25/09/23, 5:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, now before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
25/09/23, 5:26 pm - +263 78 822 3195: Now waiting for our sponsor to announce to us the financial status
25/09/23, 5:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if there are any challenges faced by the sponsor?
25/09/23, 5:52 pm - +263 78 822 3195: He's currently not available,some network challenges I suppose, will keep you informed once I get hold of them Sir.Pliz kindly bear with us
25/09/23, 6:13 pm - +263 77 993 4323: I suppose the most opportune time will be in December,when Cecilia has completed her ALevel exams,as soon as she comes back home from boarding school,we can certainly expedite the early admission processes,if it's acceptable with Edoofaa
25/09/23, 6:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: hank you for sharing your concern. Unfortunately, there are a limited number of seats granted with Early Decision benefits by universities. If we wait too long, these benefits may no longer be applicable, and one will have to proceed with the standard admission process. May I know if we are clear on this?
25/09/23, 6:33 pm - +263 78 822 3195: We will try and make them revisit the decision made Sir,I'm sure they are not aware of the consequences
25/09/23, 6:34 pm - +263 78 822 3195: As for me I'm aware Sir
25/09/23, 9:48 pm - +263 78 822 3195: [25/09, 20:39] MD: Thank you for the advice, kindly guide us on the most opportune time for processing the early admission processes. I now realize that the earlier this can be done,the better ,so as to access the benefits.
[25/09, 21:19] MD: These two we can use as options/models for our admission processes
26/09/23, 2:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon,

I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out.

Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
26/09/23, 3:48 pm - +263 78 822 3195: You are well excused sir

I'm available
26/09/23, 4:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
26/09/23, 4:38 pm - +263 78 822 3195: As per my understanding, the admission process will begin on the 30th of September, and a 15 day period of paying $300 part payment will be  given meaning on the 14th of October I do deposit $300 and the other $300 is    to be payed in the next 30 days,thus making November 14 the lapse of the 30 days
26/09/23, 4:40 pm - +263 78 822 3195: All in all $600 makes the full amount of the admission process
26/09/23, 4:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days. 

4. With the standard admission process, as a student you are not paying any more amount of fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until the parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with the admission process.
26/09/23, 4:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know if you are clear on this?
26/09/23, 5:17 pm - +263 78 822 3195: Have been trying to fully understand the admission processes and I'm sure I cleary understand now.
26/09/23, 5:20 pm - +263 78 822 3195: I go with the early registration
26/09/23, 5:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
26/09/23, 5:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Monday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.

When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *14th October* and *14th November*.
26/09/23, 5:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, If your parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines ( **14th October* and *14th November*.), they can give us the go-ahead so that we can prepare your application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
26/09/23, 5:39 pm - +263 78 822 3195: Waiting for Mr Dube to confirm also Sir, will come back to you ASAP
26/09/23, 5:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, I shall wait for the same.
26/09/23, 5:55 pm - +263 78 822 3195: Thank you Sir for the patience
26/09/23, 5:58 pm - +263 77 993 4323: Thank you for the advice, kindly guide us on the most opportune time for processing the early admission processes. I now realize that the earlier this can be done,the better ,so as to access the benefits.
26/09/23, 5:58 pm - +263 77 993 4323: These two we can use as options/models for our admission processes
26/09/23, 6:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, it would be wise if we proceed with this decision as the benefit is only available for a certain period of time.
26/09/23, 6:35 pm - +263 78 822 3195: Mr Dube has advised me to let you know that he agrees with the mentioned tentative deadlines,therefore gives you the go ahead to proceed with the application process for our daughter Cecilia Princess Dube
26/09/23, 6:36 pm - +263 78 822 3195: He's having network challenges
26/09/23, 6:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have given us the go-ahead to move forward with Cecilia’s university admission process, I believe you are financially confident that you will be able to manage the registration fee in due time by (*14th October* and *14th November*.) and are mentally prepared for the next steps? <This message was edited>
26/09/23, 6:39 pm - +263 78 822 3195: Definitely yes Sir,we are prepared
26/09/23, 6:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, as you have given us the go-ahead, let us proceed towards preparing Cecilia's application and forward it to the universities, applicable for the course and suggested by the academic board. Once we get an update from the universities, we will reconnect with you and share the same updates with you. In the meantime, if and when you have any queries, feel free to bring them forward so that we can address them and help you plan for Cecilia's higher education well.
26/09/23, 6:42 pm - +263 78 822 3195: Thank you once again, we will keep in touch
27/09/23, 6:20 am - +263 77 993 4323: Morning Honourables,may we please go ahead with the requisite processes

30/09/23, 10:44 am - +263 78 822 3195: Let's move forward honorable
30/09/23, 10:45 am - Milan Edoofa: Great! Now, for us to proceed, may you please take a look at the offer letter and answer these questions here.
30/09/23, 10:46 am - +263 78 822 3195: Just going through it again once more
30/09/23, 10:48 am - Milan Edoofa: Sure, please do taht.

03/10/23, 1:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Cecilia!
I hope you are doing well today.
03/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since it was a long weekend and the team was not available. I appreciate your patience here.
03/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a four-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 8 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
03/10/23, 1:28 pm - +263 78 822 3195: Afternoon team Edoofa
03/10/23, 1:29 pm - +263 78 822 3195: We are clear, thank you.
03/10/23, 1:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
03/10/23, 1:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
03/10/23, 1:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
03/10/23, 1:42 pm - +263 78 822 3195: Ouk,this is what we have debating about as family,that  scholarship included accommodation,but from the clarification above it does not.we correct on this one, is it?
03/10/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 993 4323: Since it's a four year course,is it an Honours Degree?
03/10/23, 1:47 pm - +263 77 993 4323: Is there organised off campus accommodation that is walking distance from the University and supervised by university mentors
03/10/23, 1:47 pm - +263 77 993 4323: I thought quoted fees is inclusive of accommodation?
03/10/23, 1:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your queries with me here, let me answer them one by one.
03/10/23, 1:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, when it comes to the scholarship on accommodation, no please it is not true. The scholarship that is being offered to you is on the tuition fee and not on the accommodation, however, the total costs after that do lie in the already discussed cost range of $2000-3000 per annum. I hope this is clear?
03/10/23, 1:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, when it comes to the fact that if it is an Honours Degree or not, then I would like to mention that it is a honours degree that also includes a year of training after 3 years of studying. I hope this is clear?
03/10/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 993 4323: How much is accommodation alone per year??
03/10/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 993 4323: Noted, one year internship and 3yrs fulltime study
03/10/23, 2:02 pm - +263 77 993 4323: Are students on attachment paid monthly salaries?
03/10/23, 2:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: It depends on the type of accommodation that you will choose for yourself please.
03/10/23, 2:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, when it comes to the training period after the course, that is specifically the training period and the opportunities that the students will get during that time will depend on various factors please. Therefore, the salary or the stipend that a student may get at that time is not certain and will be known at that time itself. I believe that is clear, right?
03/10/23, 2:47 pm - +263 77 993 4323: Noted Chief
03/10/23, 2:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
03/10/23, 2:51 pm - +263 78 822 3195: Of course, we are together team
03/10/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 993 4323: Noted, we would be happy if she's accommodated on campus though
03/10/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 993 4323: Being this far in Zimbabwe, would TRUST what Edoofian counselor teams recommend
03/10/23, 3:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, I understand that. However, on that note, I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes.

Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students. I hope this clears the doubt that you have here, right?
04/10/23, 3:41 pm - +263 78 822 3195: Good afternoon Admissions officer.

Since you shared the letter from Galgotias University on Thursday the 28th of September, do the 15 days begin counting from there on?
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents Cecilia!
I hope you are doing well today.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since I was occupied in some urgent meetings that came up. I appreciate your patience here.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, regarding the query that you have shared with me here. Stay assured that we will discuss that moving ahead during our discussion. Before that, may I know if you are clear till here so that we can proceed?
05/10/23, 4:17 pm - +263 78 822 3195: Good afternoon,we doing good
05/10/23, 4:18 pm - +263 78 822 3195: Understood Sir,let's proceed.
05/10/23, 4:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
05/10/23, 4:28 pm - +263 78 822 3195: Yes chief we did note that it's clear actually.

We can move forward.
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Cecilia!
I hope you are doing well today.
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
06/10/23, 3:32 pm - +263 78 822 3195: Afternoon honorable Milan Singh.
 We are well Sir.

Well that's nice. We're keen to know more about the crucial registration fee,otherwise we good so far.
06/10/23, 3:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
06/10/23, 3:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 13th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 13th November 2023.*
06/10/23, 3:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *13th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
06/10/23, 4:07 pm - +263 78 822 3195: Thank you for the privilege Chief,I do recall that and we appreciate the honor.

The fee breakdown is clear.We are together again.
06/10/23, 4:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
06/10/23, 4:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
06/10/23, 4:57 pm - +263 77 911 5643: May I be pardoned for the late response
06/10/23, 4:57 pm - +263 77 911 5643: I reside in Bulawayo
07/10/23, 9:37 am - +263 77 993 4323: Hello, Honourables,we may experience a bit of a challenge with 13th of October...our pay dates are during the 22/10/23week,
I was wondering if the grace period could possibly stretch that long
07/10/23, 10:17 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Cecilia!
I hope you are doing well today.
07/10/23, 10:17 am - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
07/10/23, 10:19 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, thank you for letting me know of that dear. Now, on that note, I understand that you might be facing challenges with respect to raising the required finances for Cecilia's admission process in a timely manner, and stay assured that I am here to help you with that. 

Moving ahead, can you please let me know how much amount were you able to raise towards Cecilia's registration process by now?
07/10/23, 11:32 am - +263 77 993 4323: Possibly half the amount on Thursday the 19th,(exact payday)or by that weekend since I'm mostly out of town
07/10/23, 11:34 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, so if I am getting you well, you are trying to say that you would be able to pay $300 by 19th October, right?
08/10/23, 5:36 am - +263 77 993 4323: That's my greatest hope,Chief
11/10/23, 11:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Cecilia!

12/10/23, 2:48 pm - +263 77 993 4323: To be frank, our USD salary component borders around $250....prior to requisite deductions like medical insurance etc etc, so will bunch everything from salary and other side hustle efforts
12/10/23, 2:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, I understand that. However, I was asking about the money that you have already raise for Cecilia's admission process please, how much were you able to secure as of now?
12/10/23, 3:06 pm - +263 77 993 4323: May I say the final figure can be available Wednesday 19th morning Boss
12/10/23, 3:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, I understand that. However, for me to be able to have a proper discussion with the academic board as well as the university officials, it is important that you help me with your planning. And since the deadline for the same is tomorrow it would be difficult for me to be able to have a proper discussion with the university officials, hence, please help me with the same as of now. <This message was edited>
12/10/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 993 4323: For now let's work with the $300, should my payment fall short,I will definitely raise that with you directly on the 19th
12/10/23, 3:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please. Now, on that note, I do have a way in which we can ensure that you do not miss the deadline as well as secure the scholarship seat in a timely manner. 

What you can do is that you can pay the amount that you have raised till now by tomorrow, and then the balance by 19th October 2023 please. Let's say you have $150 now, then you can pay that tomorrow and then the remaining amount by 19th October please. I hope this is clear?
12/10/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 993 4323: It is clear...but I'm apping from a network spot on the hill at school, I'm not sure if I can catch bank time after duty....that's why I earlier on asked for a move to the 19th altogether
12/10/23, 3:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please I do get that, however, since the deadline for the same is of tomorrow, we would have to take care of the same as well right, and that is why I was asking you to make a certain payment by tomorrow. I hope you understand?
12/10/23, 3:39 pm - +263 77 993 4323: Let me liase with a friend in town so they may raise some money and pay on my behalf

On that note, you can surely go ahead to do that, however, I would like to ask that since the date for you to make the payment was of 13th November 2023, then what was the reason that you were not able to do that on time?

This change brings with it an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of our Edoofians, particularly those who have arrived in India, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience are enriched and fulfilling.

Over the past two years, it has been an absolute privilege to support numerous students, including yourselves, in their pursuit of higher education. Witnessing Edoofians thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has been immensely rewarding.

Rest assured, the exceptional service and support that you have experienced will continue seamlessly as one of our accomplished admission officers, Ms. Ashi, will take over the helm of your admission journey from this point forward starting from Wednesday.

22/12/23, 12:46 pm - +263 71 237 1240: Alright. Regarding the payment balance, we are trying hard to put together finances,so that when banks reopen after the public holidays,we pay and share payment proof. Be kindly be patient with us for being a low income family, maybe all we have is this strong wish for Cecilia's dream career, which can certainly be made possible through Edoofaa, albeit our financial constraints

22/12/23, 2:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing an update regarding the payment for Cecilia's admission. Your dedication to securing Cecilia's education despite financial constraints speaks volumes. We deeply admire your determination and commitment to supporting her aspirations. Your efforts are truly commendable. If you do not mind asking. May I know when you might be comfortable making the payment?
22/12/23, 2:25 pm - +263 71 237 1240: Major challenge is that this side business has taken a break due to local holidays and Christmas festivities...but soon after that will make effort to pay
