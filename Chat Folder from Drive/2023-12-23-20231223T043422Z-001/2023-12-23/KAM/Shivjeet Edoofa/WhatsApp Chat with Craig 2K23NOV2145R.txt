Please excuse me for late arrival. How are you and your family doing today?
01/12/23, 8:04 pm - +263 77 293 4976: Good evening sir and everyone.
01/12/23, 8:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, thank you for sharing the forms with us, I have taken a note of these and will update them in our records as well.
01/12/23, 8:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
01/12/23, 8:29 pm - +263 71 855 2335: Good evening 
Yes, im ready
01/12/23, 8:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 8:34 pm - +263 71 855 2335: Im done
01/12/23, 8:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
01/12/23, 8:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
01/12/23, 8:40 pm - +263 71 855 2335: They are quite clear
01/12/23, 8:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
01/12/23, 8:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
01/12/23, 8:43 pm - +263 71 855 2335: Yes … i am
01/12/23, 8:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
01/12/23, 8:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
01/12/23, 8:46 pm - +263 71 855 2335: Yes, they are
01/12/23, 8:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
01/12/23, 8:48 pm - +263 71 855 2335: Yes
01/12/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
01/12/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understandIf you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?ing with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
01/12/23, 8:52 pm - +263 71 855 2335: Yes you can move forward

How are you doing this evening?
04/12/23, 6:25 pm - +263 77 293 4976: Good evening sir and all Edoofa team
04/12/23, 6:26 pm - +263 77 293 4976: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 6:26 pm - +263 77 293 4976: Network is slow today
04/12/23, 6:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of the challenges. May I know if you might be comfortable to proceed with the session?
04/12/23, 6:32 pm - +263 77 293 4976: Sure
04/12/23, 6:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you were able to watch the videos?
04/12/23, 6:56 pm - +263 71 855 2335: Good evening 
 Yes… we were able to watch the videos
04/12/23, 7:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. So can you share your understanding of the 4 videos in detail with me?
04/12/23, 7:29 pm - +263 71 855 2335: I understood that the first video was about a meassage to the enroled edoofians from the co-founders of Edoofa and the two important qualities of the Edoofa scholarship and the background wall showin people that are satisfied with the Edoofa program also it gives scholarship credits 

From the second video I understood that founders are talking about the character traits that distinguish a successful stufent from the restof the crowd and these traits include to follow instructions and working hard and also to be a role model by working hard ,also the Edoofa program making it easier for students to identify their skills and it also gives a robust approach, counseling of students,affordable education and quality education 

From the third video I understood that it is giving information about colleges and universities that are under Edoofa and these schools provide good quality education because Edoofa spent 10 years looking for good schools so a student should not worry ,and these schools are culture friendly, by learning each others festivals like Holy where they express love and gratitude to each other ,it also states founders have a decade ling journey in discovering these schools and they also act as parents to the students and make sure ther identity universities that are run by families of education,the also emphasize on following instructions, hard work to pass with flying colors ,why one has chosen that schools and the reasons too …they also offer EWYL ,UGC and also produce students who serve the community.

The fourth video is about the preparation for interactive sessions with the schools and statement od purpose (SOP) ,three things are needed for university placement 1) Documents 2) recommendations from counselors 3) SOP 
It also states that the SOP should convince schools why they should enroll you, solid achievement results should also be stated also the skills and strengths and should also have a vision on why you want to study that coarse,
Also the reasons on why your choosing that school,should also shoe ones resourcefulness 
Should also show your unique traits and goals and it should also convince the admission board
04/12/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
04/12/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
04/12/23, 7:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identifying reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
04/12/23, 7:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
04/12/23, 7:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
04/12/23, 7:56 pm - +263 77 293 4976: Very true
04/12/23, 8:00 pm - +263 71 855 2335: Yes we agree and also understood them
04/12/23, 8:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
04/12/23, 8:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 5:30 PM.
04/12/23, 8:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

06/12/23, 6:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and my dear student!

I trust this message finds you in good spirits. I am writing this message to you about my schedule from now and  the next seven days, specifically from December 7th to December 13th. During this time frame, I will be actively engaged in a series of meetings and discussions with our respective universities on multiple campuses and will be completely occupied within the time frame. And we will continue with our session from the 14th of December onwards again as usual. 

The objective of these discussions revolves around the ongoing evaluation and potential extension of our established endowment plan in collaboration with the university. Our intention is to delve deeper into the existing framework and explore options for an extended timeline which it will be discussed with you very soon, thereby ensuring a sustained and enhanced benefit for our students. With this, I would like you to please take care of yourself and your family, and always, warm regards to you all until we meet again.

18/12/23, 4:03 pm - +263 71 855 2335: Question 2

UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience) are two interconnected but distinct concepts that play a crucial role in the design and development of digital products and services in today's digital world.

User Interface (UI) refers to the visual and interactive elements of a digital product that users interact with. It encompasses the design of buttons, menus, forms, icons, layouts, and other visual elements. The UI is responsible for conveying information, providing navigation, and facilitating user interactions. 

User Experience (UX) encompasses the overall experience and satisfaction that a user has when interacting with a digital product or service. It goes beyond just the visual design and includes factors such as usability, accessibility, performance, and the emotional response of users. UX design involves understanding user needs, conducting research, creating user personas, wireframing, prototyping, and testing to ensure that the product meets user expectations and provides a positive and meaningful experience.

In today's digital world, UI/UX design is essential for several reasons:

1. Customer Satisfaction: Good UI/UX design enhances customer satisfaction by providing a seamless and enjoyable user experience. It focuses on meeting user needs, minimizing friction, and making interactions intuitive and effortless.
18/12/23, 4:04 pm - +263 71 855 2335: Question 3

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a communication system into seven logical layers.

1. Physical Layer: The physical layer is responsible for the transmission and reception of raw, unstructured data bits over a physical medium, such as cables or wireless signals.

2. Data Link Layer: The data link layer provides reliable and error-free communication between directly connected devices. 

3. Network Layer: The network layer enables logical addressing and routing of data packets between different networks.

4. Transport Layer: The transport layer ensures reliable and transparent end-to-end data transfer between hosts. It segments data received from the upper layers into smaller units, adds sequencing and error-checking information, and reassembles them at the receiving end.

5. Session Layer: The session layer establishes, manages, and terminates communication sessions between applications.

6. Presentation Layer: The presentation layer is responsible for the syntax and semantics of the data exchanged between applications.

7. Application Layer: The application layer is the topmost layer in the OSI model and is closest to the end user. It provides services and interfaces for applications to access network services, such as email, file transfer, web browsing, and remote file access.
18/12/23, 4:04 pm - +263 71 855 2335: Question 4

Programming refers to the process of creating computer programs or software through the use of instructions that can be understood and executed by a computer. 

A programming language, on the other hand, is a formal language with a set of rules and syntax that allows programmers to communicate instructions to a computer. It provides a structured way to express algorithms and logic, enabling programmers to write code that can be understood and executed by a computer.

In today's applications, several programming languages are widely used, each with its own strengths and areas of application. Here are the mostly used programming languages:

1. Python: Python is a versatile and beginner-friendly language known for its simplicity and readability. It has a large standard library and a vast ecosystem of third-party packages, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, including web development, data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing.

2. JavaScript: JavaScript is a scripting language primarily used for web development. It runs in web browsers and allows for interactive and dynamic web page behavior. With the rise of front-end frameworks like React and Angular, JavaScript has become a crucial language for building modern web applications.
18/12/23, 4:05 pm - +263 71 855 2335: Question 5

Compilers and interpreters are both software tools used in the process of translating and executing computer programs, but they differ in how they perform these tasks. Here are the main differences between compilers and interpreters:

1. Compilation vs. Interpretation: The fundamental difference lies in the way they execute programs. A compiler translates the entire source code of a program into machine code or a lower-level language (such as bytecode) all at once, producing an executable file that can be directly executed by the computer's processor. In contrast, an interpreter reads and executes the source code line by line or statement by statement, without creating an intermediate executable file.

Generally, compiled programs tend to execute faster than interpreted programs. Compilers perform extensive optimizations during the compilation process, such as code analysis and transformation, which can result in highly efficient machine code tailored for the target hardware. Interpreters, on the other hand, have an additional runtime overhead as they need to analyze and execute each line or statement in real-time.

Examples: Common examples of compiled languages include C, C++, Java, and Go. Interpreted languages include Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and PHP.
18/12/23, 4:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Craig!

I hope you are doing well today. Thank you for your patience; Pardon me for not being able to connect with you earlier due to technical difficulties. How are you and your family doing today as we approach the best time of the year, filled with joy and holidays?
18/12/23, 5:01 pm - +263 71 855 2335: We are doing great ..thank you 
How are you
18/12/23, 5:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details above . With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Computer Science)  and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
18/12/23, 5:09 pm - +263 71 855 2335: Yes ,your information is correct
18/12/23, 5:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. I am now sharing you with the next step of the process for now. Please go through this and we shall discuss this on the coming days.
18/12/23, 5:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Why the EDOOFA SECURE PLAN?*

Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.

*Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.

*Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.

*Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.

In summary, an Edoofa Secure Plan is a critical financial tool for parents with their children entering university soon. It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship.
18/12/23, 5:12 pm - +263 71 855 2335: Ok and thank you 
Let us go through it and get back to you
18/12/23, 5:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome.
18/12/23, 7:11 pm - +263 77 293 4976: How are you sir and all Edoofa team
18/12/23, 7:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: we are great, thank you for asking.
19/12/23, 10:22 am - Akshit Edoofa KAM joined using this group's invite link
19/12/23, 7:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well and blessed today. Please excuse me for the late reply. I was occupied with a university official today. May I know if you are available to proceed with our session?
19/12/23, 7:20 pm - +263 71 855 2335: Good evening! 
Yes we can proceed
19/12/23, 7:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, may I know if you were able to go through the above points?
19/12/23, 7:31 pm - +263 71 855 2335: Yes we were able to go through it
19/12/23, 7:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
19/12/23, 7:39 pm - +263 71 855 2335: Yes
19/12/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in December 2023, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
19/12/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
19/12/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
19/12/23, 7:56 pm - +263 71 855 2335: Yes we do
19/12/23, 7:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
19/12/23, 7:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure to earn a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
19/12/23, 7:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
19/12/23, 8:06 pm - +263 71 855 2335: Yes we do
19/12/23, 8:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
19/12/23, 8:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 5000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
19/12/23, 8:07 pm - +263 77 293 4976: Good evening everyone
Yes it can be achieved though it's a difficult journey
19/12/23, 8:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
19/12/23, 8:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
19/12/23, 8:08 pm - +263 77 293 4976: Correct
19/12/23, 8:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
19/12/23, 8:09 pm - +263 77 293 4976: Please explain
19/12/23, 8:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay. <This message was edited>
19/12/23, 8:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
19/12/23, 8:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
19/12/23, 8:29 pm - +263 71 855 2335: Yes
19/12/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
19/12/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fee.
19/12/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
19/12/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
19/12/23, 8:55 pm - +263 77 293 4976: This plan is good
19/12/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continuw tomorrow. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
19/12/23, 8:58 pm - +263 77 293 4976: You're welcome
19/12/23, 9:03 pm - +263 77 293 4976: May you also be blessed for your patience
20/12/23, 6:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Craig!

I hope you are doing well today. I would like to let you know that our available hours daily will be from 6:00 pm to 9:00 pm every day for this session. With that said may I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session?
20/12/23, 7:42 pm - +263 77 293 4976: How are you sir and all Edoofa team
20/12/23, 7:49 pm - +263 71 855 2335: Good evening 
Yes we may proceed
20/12/23, 7:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
20/12/23, 7:52 pm - +263 71 855 2335: Yes
20/12/23, 8:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
20/12/23, 8:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
20/12/23, 8:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
20/12/23, 8:11 pm - +263 77 293 4976: This is understood so how much is the plane ticket
20/12/23, 8:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The plane ticket will be ranging from $400 to $600
20/12/23, 8:14 pm - +263 77 293 4976: Ok it's clear
20/12/23, 8:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?

21/12/23, 6:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Craig !

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. May I know if you are currently available so that we can proceed with the session for your admission process?
21/12/23, 7:00 pm - +263 77 293 4976: Good evening all. How are you today
21/12/23, 7:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. May I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session?
21/12/23, 7:22 pm - +263 77 293 4976: We're ready
21/12/23, 8:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know by when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
21/12/23, 8:46 pm - +263 71 855 2335: I will discuss with them by tomorrow
21/12/23, 8:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow properly. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
