25/09/23, 3:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am doing well too. Thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with our session for your admission process?

25/09/23, 4:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: So, Tanatswa, may I know if you have decided to proceed with the course BBA IT?

BBA IT is a specialized program focusing on the intersection of business management and information technology. Due to its specialized nature, it tends to have a higher cost compared to more general courses.

The estimated cost for pursuing a BBA IT program typically ranges between $2700 to $3700. This includes tuition fees, materials, and other associated expenses for the entire course. It's important for students to consider this cost aspect while planning their educational finances.
25/09/23, 4:28 pm - +263 77 328 7663: However l am not willing to do a degree that require lower points when l have more than the points required
25/09/23, 5:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am really happy to hear that from you. However, since you are enrolled in the Edoofa program I am sure that you will be able to score more points and will be able to achieve a higher quantum of scholarship. May I know if we are clear here?
25/09/23, 5:26 pm - +263 77 328 7663: But l can not do BBA IT
25/09/23, 5:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know what happened, dear?
25/09/23, 5:30 pm - +263 77 328 7663: I can not do a degree that needs 3 points when l have secured more than 3 points
25/09/23, 5:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you clarify. If you want to pursue any course that you are eligible in India for your higher education, the eligibility criteria are a little different than in Zimbabwe. Universities look for passing grades in specific subjects rather than solely focusing on points. The university will seek if you have passed all the required subjects, meaning securing at least 1 point in each of the three subjects you will be appearing for in your A levels.
25/09/23, 6:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'll be wrapping up our discussion for now as I need to connect with another batch of my students. To continue our conversation, I propose scheduling our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM.

Wishing you a fantastic day, and please extend my warm regards to your wonderful family too.

22/12/23, 4:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
22/12/23, 4:14 pm - +263 77 328 7663: Thats great
22/12/23, 4:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
22/12/23, 4:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
22/12/23, 4:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
22/12/23, 4:17 pm - +263 77 328 7663: Yes
22/12/23, 4:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $650.
22/12/23, 4:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $650. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
22/12/23, 4:23 pm - +263 77 328 7663: Yes
22/12/23, 4:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
22/12/23, 4:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
22/12/23, 4:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $650, you'll need to make a payment of $325 on or before December 30, 2023. The remaining $325 should be paid by January 30, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
22/12/23, 4:30 pm - +263 77 328 7663: January 2023 or 2024
22/12/23, 4:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
22/12/23, 4:36 pm - +263 77 328 7663: No l am not aware sir
22/12/23, 4:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
22/12/23, 4:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
22/12/23, 4:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
22/12/23, 4:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
22/12/23, 4:51 pm - +263 77 328 7663: Ok sir
22/12/23, 5:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
22/12/23, 6:08 pm - +263 77 328 7663: I agree with benefit number 6
22/12/23, 6:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
22/12/23, 6:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
22/12/23, 6:13 pm - +263 77 328 7663: Yes sir
22/12/23, 6:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
22/12/23, 6:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
22/12/23, 6:16 pm - +263 77 328 7663: Yes
22/12/23, 6:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
22/12/23, 6:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
