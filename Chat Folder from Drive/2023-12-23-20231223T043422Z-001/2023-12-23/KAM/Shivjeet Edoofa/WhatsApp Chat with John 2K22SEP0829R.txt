I hope this message finds you well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you at our scheduled time today. I was currently occupied with a meeting with the admission team. So, I will connect with you on Monday at 3:00 PM. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your family as well.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you earlier as it was the weekend, followed by a national holiday on Monday, which was Gandhi Jayanti. Allow me to provide you with a little knowledge about it as well. Gandhi Jayanti is an annual national holiday in India celebrated on October 2nd to commemorate the birthday of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi. He was a prominent leader in the Indian independence movement against British rule and a proponent of nonviolent civil disobedience as a means of achieving political and social change.

If you're ready to start now, let's make the most of this opportunity and have a productive session.
