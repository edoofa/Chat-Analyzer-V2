04/10/23, 2:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and My dear student!

I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed. May I know if you are facing any challenges?
04/10/23, 3:00 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Greetings, Mr Shivjeet.  We are all fine. My sincere apology if there was no response from Yemurai.  Maybe it was due to a clash between her school lessons and her time slot. Since she is now writing her final examination, I trust she will be fully dedicated to this program  once she finishes.
04/10/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Can I stand in for her for the mean time or else the messages need direct response from her?
04/10/23, 3:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I now have a better understanding of the situation, and I appreciate you providing this information in advance. It's clear that Yemurai may face some difficulties in attending our session due to school activities. I kindly request both you and Yemurai to be aware that this is a family discussion group, and could also be proceeded exclusively with the parents as well. So, shall we further proceed with the session?
04/10/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Well noted with thanks. Fine we can proceed.
04/10/23, 4:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Before we commence our discussion, I would like to reiterate an update to you about my operational hours, which span from *2:00 pm to 10:30 pm CAT*. I kindly request that you plan your availability to align with these time slots. 

Our discussion sessions have been meticulously organized within these windows to ensure engaging and fruitful conversations. May I safely assume that you've taken note of our designated discussion hours?
04/10/23, 4:07 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Yes, I have taken note of the time slot. Just to let you know that from Monday to Friday  between 5pm and 6pm I will be traveling back home from work so the responses might delay as anticipated but will catch up once I arrive home.
04/10/23, 4:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of the same. I'm glad to see that you've acknowledged our operational hours. Given our strong enthusiasm and meticulous preparation to advance your admission process, I would greatly appreciate your confirmation of your readiness to embark on this journey. So, may I kindly inquire if you are prepared to initiate the admission process at this time?

Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Biochemistry) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
04/10/23, 4:43 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Yes, the arrival dates in India are correct. For the course is there room to change? i will have to get confirmation from Yemurai herself.
04/10/23, 4:45 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Is it also okay for Yemurai to chip in if she is available during the discussion time, especially during the evening after school
04/10/23, 4:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes it is indeed possible for Yemurai to chip in.
04/10/23, 4:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: And for the change in course fif Yemurai is eligible of the desired course it is indeed possible to change the course.
04/10/23, 5:01 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Noted with thanks.
04/10/23, 5:02 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Nice to hear that, let me wait for her answer . In the meantime let me check on her so that I get a response
04/10/23, 5:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Very well, I shall wait for the same.
04/10/23, 5:14 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Noted will come back to you shortly
04/10/23, 5:31 pm - +263 77 409 0314: I have confirmed with her, she said she is now interested in BSc in Medical Laboratory Technology. Not sure now if she is eligible.
04/10/23, 5:39 pm - +263 78 475 5539: Greeting to you all. I have been following up today's discussion. I am glad to inform you that going forward I shall be able to join you around this hour up to your closing time.
04/10/23, 5:41 pm - +263 77 409 0314: So we shall be participating together with Yemurai.

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
04/10/23, 6:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would like you to know that I will be closing our session for now as I have to attend to another batch of my students. Thank you so much for your time, and we shall connect tomorrow at 3:00 PM. Have a great day ahead!
04/10/23, 7:18 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Noted.
04/10/23, 7:22 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Thank you too for you time.
04/10/23, 8:06 pm - +263 77 409 0314: <Media omitted>

05/10/23, 3:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and My dear student. 

How are you doing this lovely afternoon?
05/10/23, 3:09 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Good afternoon Mr. Shivjeet. I am doing well. Your dear student is at school. Thank you.
05/10/23, 3:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Than you for letting me know. May I know if you might be able to proceed with the session?
05/10/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Yes, we can proceed.
05/10/23, 3:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for sharing the documents with me, it is well noted by the admission team. We are ready and excited to commence your academic journey for the year 2024. 

To proceed with our discussion, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure. I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure.
05/10/23, 3:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Yes, I still remember it.
05/10/23, 3:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
05/10/23, 3:58 pm - +263 77 409 0314: What I still recall is that application letters have been sent to  various universities that offer what has been selected by Yemurai. So, at this stage, when selected, Yemurai will undergo interviews and then wait for the results. She will then choose the university she desires if she has many offers.
05/10/23, 4:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is absolutely correct.
05/10/23, 4:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
05/10/23, 4:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
05/10/23, 4:14 pm - +263 77 409 0314: That will be fine. We are really happy as a family and we have been waiting for this stage.
05/10/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Definitely, we are together.
05/10/23, 5:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
05/10/23, 5:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 5:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
05/10/23, 5:23 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Thank you for such an inspirational update. I am very glad to be part of this exciting program. It really makes our dream come true.
05/10/23, 5:24 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Yes I am ready you can go ahead.
05/10/23, 5:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
05/10/23, 5:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
05/10/23, 5:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
05/10/23, 7:00 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Yes I have gone through the benefits. Yes you can explain each in details
05/10/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would like you to know that I will be closing our session for now as I have to attend to another batch of my students. Thank you so much for your time, and we shall connect on Monday at 3:00 PM. Have a great weekend and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
05/10/23, 8:01 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Noted with many  thanks. Thank you, too, for dedicating your precious time to take us through. Nice weekend, too. Bye.
09/10/23, 2:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and My dear student. 

I trust you had a restful weekend with your family. May I kindly inquire if you are presently available to continue with our session?
09/10/23, 3:05 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Afternoon Mr Shivjeet. We had a refreshing weekend. Hope you also had a restful weekend. We can proceed.
09/10/23, 3:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes I did too, thank you for asking. Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
09/10/23, 3:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of Blessing's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete her registration formalities, you will be presented with her Official Admission Letter with the help of which she will be able to apply for the student visa.
09/10/23, 3:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Blessing, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing her seat before the competition even begins. She will be the trailblazer among her peers, firmly positioning her as a frontiersperson in this endeavor.
09/10/23, 3:44 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Well noted. This is interesting.
09/10/23, 3:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes it is
09/10/23, 3:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
09/10/23, 3:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
09/10/23, 3:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/10/23, 3:49 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Well understood
09/10/23, 3:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
09/10/23, 3:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/10/23, 4:08 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Yes it's very clear.
09/10/23, 4:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
09/10/23, 4:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
09/10/23, 4:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
09/10/23, 4:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
09/10/23, 4:26 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Yes I am following, it is clear.
09/10/23, 4:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
09/10/23, 4:39 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Sure, you can provide more information in that regard.
09/10/23, 4:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
09/10/23, 4:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
09/10/23, 4:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
09/10/23, 4:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
09/10/23, 4:53 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Thank you. I got you but may you elaborate more where you are saying if a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Secondly you said they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship, does it mean it may change from 50%.
09/10/23, 4:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, I'd be happy to provide further clarification.

When I mentioned that if a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application, I mean that if a student initially applied with their previous academic records because they were awaiting their A Level results, once those results are available, the university will consider them in the application process.

Regarding the scholarship percentage, yes, you're correct. The initial 50% scholarship offered at the provisional admission stage is a minimum guarantee. Depending on the student's academic performance in their A Levels, the university may reevaluate and potentially increase the scholarship percentage. This means that the scholarship may indeed change from the initial 50% based on their actual academic achievements in the A Level exams. <This message was edited>
09/10/23, 4:55 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Great news.
09/10/23, 5:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you are clear so that we can proced with the session?
09/10/23, 5:03 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Yes, you can proceed.
09/10/23, 5:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
09/10/23, 5:07 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Yes, I agree
09/10/23, 5:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
09/10/23, 5:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
09/10/23, 5:14 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Yes very clear.
09/10/23, 5:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
09/10/23, 5:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
09/10/23, 5:19 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Yes it's clear
09/10/23, 5:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
09/10/23, 5:23 pm - +263 77 409 0314: It's clear.
09/10/23, 5:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
09/10/23, 5:25 pm - +263 77 409 0314: So far so good, no queries.
09/10/23, 5:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Yemurai  guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Yemurai is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter? <This message was edited>

09/10/23, 5:39 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Thank you very much. I will be waiting to hear from you.
17/10/23, 11:21 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Yemurai,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am Ms. Vilsha, and I serve as the Head of Admissions at Edoofa. We have some incredible news to share with you and your family! 

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application at the universities in India under the Endowment plan.
17/10/23, 11:21 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With all the efforts we have invested, I am thrilled to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, PDM University in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.

The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, as we received it early, we wanted to share it with you early and get a head start on our discussions. Please take your time to thoroughly review the letter, and then we will discuss its contents in detail. <This message was edited>
17/10/23, 11:21 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In the meantime, I would encourage you to note down any queries or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. When we reconnect to discuss this letter, having your questions prepared will help ensure a productive discussion. Once you have taken note of this letter, please let me know so that we can schedule our next discussion accordingly. Congratulations to you and your family! ⭐
17/10/23, 11:22 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 5:28 am - +263 77 409 0314: Greetings Ms. Vilsha. We are very exited as a family with the good news you have conveyed to us. We shall review the letter and will let you know for further discussions
18/10/23, 7:51 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I am delighted to hear your positive response Parents and Yemurai, and I am sure your family will be equally thrilled when they hear the news. 

To ensure we can discuss the offer letter well and address any questions or concerns you may have, could you kindly let me know if you will be available to connect with us today in the evening at 07:30 PM? 

This would provide us with ample time to have a detailed conversation and guide you on the next steps you are to undertake to complete your admission formalities.
18/10/23, 8:34 am - +263 77 409 0314: Is it possible that we have the discussion in the afternoon, from 2pm. I am afraid that we might have some connectivity challenges in the evening. We have network challenges where we stay.
18/10/23, 8:41 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, @263774090314, I completely understand the network challenges you are experiencing. However, I have a meeting scheduled with the admissions team at 02:00 PM, which might make it challenging for me to have a smooth discussion with you.

Let me make some adjustments to my schedule and see if we can connect at 02:00 PM. Since we are scheduling this discussion specifically for you and your family, I hope you will be actively available at that time?
18/10/23, 8:48 am - +263 77 409 0314: Thank you very much. I really appreciate and will be actively available at that time.
18/10/23, 10:20 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Amazing @263774090314. In that case, let us plan to reconnect in the afternoon at 02:00 PM. We are eagerly looking forward to our discussion and will be fully prepared to assist you.
18/10/23, 10:23 am - +263 77 409 0314: Well noted. Thank you.
18/10/23, 2:04 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Good afternoon, I am ready for the session.
18/10/23, 2:15 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Afternoon once again Parents and Yeumrai,

Thank you for reaching out. First of all, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival. <This message was edited>
18/10/23, 2:15 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
18/10/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Good afternoon. For sure, we are excited about this good news. Yes, we have gone through the letter. We can go ahead with the discussion in details.
18/10/23, 2:21 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: That is indeed reassuring Mrs. Chidawanyika, and I am glad to know that you have gone through Yemurai's offer letter from PDM University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
18/10/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Yes, I have gone  through it.
18/10/23, 2:23 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1) What’s Yemurai's per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's her accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
18/10/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Yemurai's tuition fee per annum  after scholarship is USD1315.
- Her accommodation  per year is USD1250.
- Registration Fee is $750
18/10/23, 3:49 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright, Ma'am. With this, let us now shift our attention to the registration fee mentioned in Yemurai's offer letter. As previously explained, the registration fee of $750 is not an extra cost, it is included in her first-year educational expenses. Therefore, the amount of the fee you will need to pay once she arrives in India will be as follows:
18/10/23, 3:52 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: 1. If Yeukrai goes with the *Off-campus accommodation*, this means you only need to pay the tuition fee to the university. Therefore, the fee balance becomes $1315 - $750 = $565, and this must be paid in one part within three days of Yemurai's arrival in India.
18/10/23, 3:52 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: 2. Consequently, if Yeukrai goes with the *On-campus accommodation*, she will be required to pay the tuition fee of $1315 and the accommodation fee of $1250. This results in a total fee of $2565. After the registration fee has been deducted, the balance will be $2565 - $750 = $1815. This amount can be paid in two installments of $907 and $908 at a gap of 6 months. 

The first installment can be paid either before Yemurai's arrival in India or within three days of his arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.
18/10/23, 3:52 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I hope this clarifies the fee structure, and we are on the same page regarding these options?
18/10/23, 4:03 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Fine, I am on this option. It is clear.
18/10/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Yes, we are on the same page
18/10/23, 4:12 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that Ma'am and you can certainly go with the second option as per your preference. At the same time, as you can see in Yemurai's offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as October 31st, 2023*. <This message was edited>
18/10/23, 4:12 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to Yemurai through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that she is entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
18/10/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Well noted.
18/10/23, 4:17 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Yes, you can go ahead and explain.
18/10/23, 4:23 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on Yemurai's behalf, and as a parent, you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $300 before the first deadline date of *October 31st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $300 before the second deadline date of *November 30th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
18/10/23, 4:24 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Yemurai's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the *full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before October 31st, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
18/10/23, 4:28 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Well noted, since we have been preparing for this stage, we shall make the full payment of $600 before the 31st of Oct 23.
18/10/23, 4:31 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Maybe before making  the payment, is there any room of receiving more Offer letters to make a comparison.
18/10/23, 5:03 pm - +263 77 409 0314: For the next 30 minutes, I will be traveling, so I shall have limited access to my mobile. Thank you.
18/10/23, 5:13 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: My apologies for the delayed response, Ma'am. I received an unexpected call from one of our students, which required my immediate attention. However, I have now reviewed the message you shared, and I am pleased to hear that you are well-prepared with the necessary finances. 

This instills confidence that your student's admission process is on track, and they will be able to pursue higher education successfully. Without a doubt, you can proceed with making a one-time payment of $600 to secure Yemurai's scholarship seat.
18/10/23, 5:14 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Also, to address your query about additional offer letters, I would like to provide you with insights into how the university processes applications, and that would help you with the clarity you need. As you mentioned that you will be traveling for the next 30 minutes and may have limited mobile access, I want to confirm whether you are comfortable continuing our discussion now or if you would prefer to pause and reconvene later this evening at 7:30 PM?
18/10/23, 5:54 pm - +263 77 409 0314: It is ok.
18/10/23, 5:57 pm - +263 77 409 0314: I am now settled, and we can continue. I hope I won't face  challenges with network connectivity.
18/10/23, 6:10 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that and thank you for giving us this update. Addressing the query you had, I am sure you know that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
18/10/23, 6:10 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: As of now, Yemurai's application has been accepted by PDM University and since we have shared her application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from others. 

Once we get the same update, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application. So you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. I hope we are together with this?
18/10/23, 6:30 pm - +263 77 409 0314: No, I do not have any university on my mind. I was just wondering what would happen if I  pay the tuition fee now soon after that we  receive other offer letters, which we may have   interest in. Hope my question is clear.
18/10/23, 10:10 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I can understand your question and thank you for your elaboration. As you know each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by PDM University, Yemurai would lose out on the scholarship from PDM University and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with such a situation, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
18/10/23, 11:57 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Ok, I sm not aware of the transfer option. How does it work?
19/10/23, 11:28 am - Vilsha Edoofa: That is alright Ma'am, let me help you with the same. To provide you with a better perspective on the transfer option: You can confidently reserve Yemurai's scholarship seat at PDM University by paying her registration fee without any worries or concerns.

In the future, if Yemurai receives a better scholarship offer and decides to change her university, she will have the opportunity to do so without incurring any additional costs.

Alternatively, if you receive another offer letter in the future and find that PDM University's offer is still the better choice, she can pursue her education there without losing the entire scholarship. This flexibility ensures that you can make the best decision for Yemurai's academic journey.
19/10/23, 11:29 am - Vilsha Edoofa: To illustrate this with an example: Let us assume you have paid $750 to PDM University to reserve Yemurai's seat there. Later on, Yemurai received a better offer from University A, where the registration fee was also $750.

If you decide to switch her admission to University A, in that scenario, you would need to pay $750. However, because Yemurai had already paid $750 to PDM University, this same amount would be adjusted against his fee at University A. Therefore, you would not need to pay any additional money to secure her scholarship seat at University A or to make the switch.

I hope this explanation clarifies the process, addresses your first query and provides you with a better understanding of how it works? <This message was edited>
19/10/23, 12:02 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Good afternoon Ms. Vilsha. Yes, I am answered now. Thank you for the clarification
19/10/23, 12:04 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Afternoon to you as well Ma'am and you are most welcome. Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
19/10/23, 12:12 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Ok, is there any other option that is available for depositing the registration fee than making a deposit into the bank details provided on the offer letter?
19/10/23, 12:13 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, please, now that we are clear with the payment plan, we can also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
19/10/23, 12:13 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
19/10/23, 12:16 pm - +263 77 409 0314: We are in Mutare.
19/10/23, 12:19 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
19/10/23, 12:19 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
19/10/23, 12:19 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
19/10/23, 12:23 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Ok thank you.
19/10/23, 12:25 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
19/10/23, 12:25 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 11% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
19/10/23, 12:36 pm - +263 77 409 0314: I will go for this one which  is more convenient to me. Yes you can provide the account  details once again.
19/10/23, 1:25 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright please. If that was a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
19/10/23, 1:27 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Thank you so much will share the confirmation of deposit once it's done.
19/10/23, 1:34 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Surely @263774090314, that would be absolutely fine. Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
19/10/23, 1:46 pm - +263 77 409 0314: I do not have any other queries, let us proceed.
19/10/23, 1:47 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Surely Ma'am. In that case, let me share a few insights into the PDM University with you -
19/10/23, 1:47 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: PDM University, short for Prabhu Dayal Memorial University, is a prominent institution located in Delhi, India. It has a remarkable history, having initially operated as an institution before attaining university status in 2016.
19/10/23, 1:47 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Situated in the bustling metropolis of Delhi, PDM University boasts the advantage of easy access to the city's efficient metro rail system. This achievement signifies the university's significant growth over a mere five years. Its success has been so substantial that it played a pivotal role in the government's decision to construct a metro station, further enhancing the accessibility of the institution to the entire city through the metro rail network.
19/10/23, 1:48 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: To gain a comprehensive understanding of PDM University's credentials and official recognition by the government of India, you can visit their website by following this link: [PDM University - Recognition & Approval] (https://www.pdm.ac.in/recognition-approval/). <This message was edited>

19/10/23, 1:56 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome Ma'am and I am glad to see that you have taken a proactive step, before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasize the importance of sharing Yemurai's offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
19/10/23, 1:56 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for Yemurai and your family, as she has received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing him one step closer to realizing her dream of pursuing education abroad.
19/10/23, 1:57 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on Tuesday. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for Yemurai's admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
19/10/23, 1:59 pm - +263 77 409 0314: For sure, everybody is excited.
19/10/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Well noted, it sounds very good.

19/10/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Thank you very much for your time.  Ok, I will do so.
20/10/23, 12:33 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Good afternoon.

20/10/23, 9:51 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Good evening. Well noted

23/11/23, 7:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Additionally , Since your admission intake is for August 2024, you will be working on the visa requirements for now and towards the month of April 2024 when the universities release the tentative arrival dates for the upcoming batch. That is when you will be visiting the embassy to submit your documents and process your visa application further. I hope you are clear on this?

22/12/23, 9:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I trust that you and your family are doing well today. I am pleased to connect with you today to share some positive updates with you.

In light of your admission process, As we have shared that one of our partnered universities, Lovely Professional University (LPU), which is among the top 100 universities in India, has been considering your application for the scholarship opportunity. They have mentioned that they would be able to give us an update by the month of January, considering the high volume of applications they have received in the past two months (more than 2000 applications).
22/12/23, 9:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In addition to this, the academic board also mentioned that there are a few more universities willing to put your application in consideration for scholarship opportunities in the month of January. Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter. This approach allows you to have multiple scholarship options, giving you the flexibility to decide on the university for your education in India and then carry out your visa application process the right way.
22/12/23, 9:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this update, I also want to inform you that since we are waiting for updates from the universities, we will be holding our conversation until 20th January and will reconnect around the same time. Until then, we wanted to share these updates with you so that you are well-informed about the process and know what lies ahead. We are thrilled to be a part of this new chapter in your academic journey.
22/12/23, 9:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, now that you are done with your admission process, you are encouraged to channel your energy and focus on your Earn While You Learn (EWYL) journey so that you can maximize the benefits from it. May this period be filled with meaningful learning, personal growth, and amazing opportunities. 

If you are not connected with your EWYL Mentor or if you have any queries/concerns related to your admission journey, please feel free to reach out to us and we will do our best to assist you!
