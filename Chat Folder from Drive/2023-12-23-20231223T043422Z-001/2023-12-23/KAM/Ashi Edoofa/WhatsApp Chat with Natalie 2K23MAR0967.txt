To proceed with our discussion, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure. I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure.
05/09/23, 7:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/09/23, 7:07 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Noted sir
05/09/23, 7:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: So, May I know if you recall the discussion we had for the admission process?
05/09/23, 7:46 pm - +263 71 341 1286: A little recap would help sir
06/09/23, 2:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Name.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further yesterday, as I was occupied with a meeting. 

For further continuation please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
06/09/23, 2:16 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Yes I am
06/09/23, 3:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about that. It is alright, I am more than happy to help you recall and understand the process of the admission process. With that in mind, I will provide you with a detailed breakdown and summary of the process. So, if you are ready, may I proceed with this?
06/09/23, 3:29 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Yes please
06/09/23, 3:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. The main focus of our university admission process is completing your scholarship application and sharing it with endorsed universities. Edoofa will submit your application to multiple universities, which will evaluate your eligibility in a day or two. If eligible, you'll receive an offer letter with scholarship details, tuition fees, accommodation costs, and registration fees. If multiple universities accept your application, you can't practically study at all of them.
06/09/23, 3:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You must make a crucial decision among the various offer letters you receive, considering factors like university exposure, ranking, and affordability. After choosing a university, you need to reserve your scholarship seat by paying a registration fee, typically $500 to $750, within two to four weeks of receiving the offer letter. This fee is considered part of the first-year tuition for Edoofa Program students and should be paid in your home country to secure the seat. Are we clear here?
06/09/23, 4:22 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Clear sir
06/09/23, 4:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. You are qualified for a scholarship through Edoofa, reducing your annual education cost in India to $2000 to $3000, covering tuition, food, accommodation, and other expenses. Let's use an example to explain the registration process. If your chosen university has the following fees:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per year
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per year
Registration Fee: $750 (due within two weeks)
06/09/23, 4:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The total fee would be a Tuition Fee of $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee of $1000 = $2800 per year. To reserve your scholarship seat, you pay the $750 registration fee, which is adjusted to your first-year fee, making it $2800 - $750 = $2050. You can pay this in two installments of $1025 each, with the first due within the first three days of your arrival in India. The remaining balance can be paid in monthly installments for financial flexibility and on-time payments. Please let me know if you are clear here.
06/09/23, 4:37 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Noted
06/09/23, 5:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Upon successfully paying the registration fee, your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account will be linked to the university's fee account. This allows you to use your EWYL credits to offset your annual university fees, providing you with financial flexibility throughout your education. 

Additionally, after the registration fee payment, you will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, which is crucial for securing admission and obtaining your student visa. If you have any questions about the admission process or the associated costs for your higher education, please feel free to ask.
06/09/23, 5:46 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Noted 
No questions so far
06/09/23, 5:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
06/09/23, 5:51 pm - +263 71 341 1286: No I wasn’t aware
06/09/23, 5:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand Natalie, it is alright, let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.
06/09/23, 5:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
 
As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
06/09/23, 6:00 pm - +263 71 341 1286: It is a big relief 🥳🥺
06/09/23, 8:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing to hear that, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
06/09/23, 8:27 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Yes please
06/09/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
06/09/23, 8:30 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Yes sir
06/09/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:
06/09/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.

3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
06/09/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, choosing the early decision benefits brings two additional advantages:

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.

*The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program*
06/09/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through these benefits so that we can discuss all of them one by one.
06/09/23, 8:42 pm - +263 71 341 1286: I have gone through them and I’m glad they also consider and cover those who don’t make it
06/09/23, 8:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
06/09/23, 8:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. As you await your A-Level results, initiating the university admission process now positions you as an early applicant. This status comes with the advantage of receiving a provisional letter of intent from the university. This letter will outline your scholarship percentage and associated fees. Once you complete your registration formalities and your results are available, you'll be provided with your Official Admission Letter. This letter will enable you to proceed with your student visa application. I trust this point is now clear to you.
06/09/23, 8:50 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Very clear sir
06/09/23, 9:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
06/09/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Students now have the reamrkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This can be achieved by making an early decision to initiate the university admission process and securing your seat in advance. By taking this step, you can avail the early decision benefits previously mentioned. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
06/09/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
06/09/23, 9:06 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Understood sir
06/09/23, 9:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
06/09/23, 9:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be skillfully adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
06/09/23, 9:16 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Noted sir
06/09/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, we're offering the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
06/09/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
06/09/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 8, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 8, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 8, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
06/09/23, 9:18 pm - +263 71 341 1286: 2024 In October,
06/09/23, 9:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Kindly excuse for the error it would be October 2023.
06/09/23, 9:27 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Okay noted
06/09/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
06/09/23, 9:36 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Please provide information
06/09/23, 9:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student decides to initiate their admission process before receiving their A-Level results, they gain the advantage of early registration benefits. At this stage, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from entities like Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship percentage as promised.
06/09/23, 9:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there might be a scenario where the student might not achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels. 

In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship. However, if a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university with early decision benefits, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged.
06/09/23, 9:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On the other hand, if a student manages to achieve a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application once the results are available. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how this gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process as per the standard procedures?
06/09/23, 9:43 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Yes sir I understand
06/09/23, 9:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
06/09/23, 9:54 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Yes
06/09/23, 10:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career ((Benefit Number 7)*
06/09/23, 10:20 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Yes sir
06/09/23, 10:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it was a long day for me and our available hours have ended. I would like us to reconnect again tomorrow, please. Have a great night and my warm regards to your lovely family as well. <This message was edited>
06/09/23, 10:39 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Thank you 
Have a great night too
07/09/23, 1:50 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Yes please
07/09/23, 2:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2023 and once your results come in 2024, you will be able to join the August 2024 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
07/09/23, 4:20 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Noted
07/09/23, 7:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening, Kindly excuse me for the delay in responding; our availability for the first slot has just concluded.
07/09/23, 7:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the early decision benefits, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for  another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
07/09/23, 7:43 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Clear sir
07/09/23, 9:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2023, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2024, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2023 itself.
07/09/23, 9:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?

09/09/23, 9:50 am - +263 71 341 1286: I’m doing well and yourself?
09/09/23, 9:55 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?

09/09/23, 10:18 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account. <This message was edited>

11/09/23, 9:05 pm - +263 71 341 1286: They loved the idea as it is a huge relief on the financial burden.
11/09/23, 9:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear, dear. Now before we move forward and have a conversation regarding the same, may I know if your parents are available with us for this session and if they have any queries that you would like to ask or any concerns that have been bothering you and you would like to share?
12/09/23, 3:41 am - +263 71 341 1286: No questions yet
12/09/23, 1:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Natalie.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. 


Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
12/09/23, 3:17 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Yes sir
12/09/23, 4:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Great! It is good to know all of us are on the same page. I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.*
12/09/23, 5:37 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Noted sir
12/09/23, 7:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, Kindly excuse me for the late reply, our available hours for the first slot have just ended.
12/09/23, 8:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due date will be mentioned.
12/09/23, 8:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?*
12/09/23, 10:27 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Noted
13/09/23, 8:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Natalie. How are you doing this lovely evening?
13/09/23, 8:05 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Good and you sir
13/09/23, 8:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
13/09/23, 8:09 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Yes I am
13/09/23, 8:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is amazing to hear. Alright, please. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
13/09/23, 8:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
13/09/23, 8:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
13/09/23, 8:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
13/09/23, 8:17 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Following
13/09/23, 8:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great. Now you have two ways to proceed with your child’s university admission process -

*1. Proceed as per the standard procedures*
*2. Proceed with the Early Decision Benefits*

Be assured that I will help you understand the difference between both of them so that you can make a well-informed decision regarding your child’s university admission process. Shall we start with our discussion regarding the same?
13/09/23, 8:42 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Yes please
13/09/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, let us start with the *Standard Registration/University Admission process*-

As you are aware that one’s registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university, to be on the safer side, let us assume that the registration fee is $750 itself.

As per the standard procedures, once you get the offer letter from the university, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of $750.

For example, if you get the offer letter on the 17th of September and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, the deadline for the registration fee would be the 1st of October 2023 and you would have to make the payment of the fee before then. Are you clear about this?
13/09/23, 8:55 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Yes sir
13/09/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great, now let us discuss the *Early Registration/University Admission process -*

As the name states, a student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.

If you do that, you are eligible for all 6 benefits that we discussed earlier. Since the benefit number 3 and 4 helps you ease the registration process, I will be discussing the same in particular and help you understand how that happens -

When we talk about the Early Decision Grant of $150 (benefit number 3)
13/09/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To understand the same, let us once again assume that the registration fee due is $750 and if you have a grant of $150, this means that out of the fee due of $750, $150 will be paid by the Edoofa Academic Board on your behalf and hence this leaves your child’s fee due as $750 - $150 = $600.

So, the amount that you will have to pay to reserve/lock your child’s scholarship seat becomes $600.
13/09/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

*1. The first part ~ $300* is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 17th of September, the deadline becomes the 1st of October, 2023)

*2. The second part ~ $300* is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 17th of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 1st of October 2023, making the second deadline the 1st of November, 2023).

Please let me know if we are on the same page here as well?
13/09/23, 9:02 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Following
13/09/23, 9:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
13/09/23, 9:03 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Clear sir
13/09/23, 9:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, now before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
13/09/23, 9:12 pm - +263 71 341 1286: I can starts my admission process as I await my results. I can proceed with my admission process by proceeding as per standard procedures or I can proceed with the Early Decision Benefits whereby Edoofa gives me a grant of $150 to lift the financial burden. I can also pay in installments which is something I don’t get with the proceeding as per the standard procedure
13/09/23, 9:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days.
13/09/23, 9:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. With the standard admission process, as a student you are not paying any more amount of fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until your parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with your admission process.

Please let me know if you are clear on this?
13/09/23, 9:42 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Understood
13/09/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
13/09/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Monday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.

When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *1st October* and *1st November*.
13/09/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, If you as parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines (*1st October* and *1st November*.), you can give us the go-ahead so that we can prepare Natalie’s application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
13/09/23, 9:51 pm - +263 71 341 1286: I’m sure she will give an answer tomorrow 
She’s traveling with work
13/09/23, 9:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. Indeed, please have a discussion with your mother and we shall connect tomorrow at 7:30 PM. Have a great day ahead.
13/09/23, 10:01 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Thank you
14/09/23, 10:45 am - +263 77 236 9938: Good morning.Am Natalie's mom have been following through all the conversations.Am comfortable with the arrangement of the $150 grant.I will be ready to pay part payment by 1st of October and the other part by 1st November
14/09/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Natalie. How are you doing this lovely evening?
14/09/23, 8:59 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Good thanks and you
14/09/23, 9:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking and for the go-ahead for the admission process. 

Alright please, as you have given us the go-ahead, let us proceed towards preparing Natalie’s application and forward it to the universities, applicable for the course and suggested by the academic board. Once we get an update from the universities, we will reconnect with you and share the same updates with you. In the meantime, if and when you have any queries, feel free to bring them forward so that we can address them and help you plan for Natalie’s higher education well.
14/09/23, 9:11 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Noted
14/09/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
14/09/23, 9:37 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Noted 
Thank you
20/09/23, 8:10 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Natalie!
I hope you all are doing well. 

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa, and today, I have some incredible news to share with you all! After you gave the admissions team the green light to proceed with your university application process, the team worked on processing your application accordingly. And, I'm thrilled to inform you that the university application process has been a success and you have received a prestigious offer from Galgotias University. Congratulations on this incredible achievement. 🌟✨🎓
20/09/23, 8:10 am - Milan Edoofa: The University will be mailing you the letter shortly, since we received the letter early, we are sharing it with you here. Take your time to review the letter and then once you are done going through it, we will then have a discussion about the letter in detail and address any questions or concerns you may have. Congratulations on this prestigious offer and securing a scholarship! Your hard work has truly paid off! ⭐🌟
20/09/23, 8:10 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 1:21 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Wow this is amazing
20/09/23, 1:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that Natalie. Now, may I know if you have gone through the offer letter by now?
20/09/23, 3:48 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Yes I have
20/09/23, 3:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Galgotias University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. 

In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
20/09/23, 4:06 pm - +263 71 341 1286: 900
5years
$300
Registration is $750
20/09/23, 4:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a five-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 10 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
20/09/23, 4:08 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Yes I am clear
20/09/23, 4:08 pm - +263 71 341 1286: How many months per semester ?
20/09/23, 4:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: It would be 6 months in every semester please. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
20/09/23, 4:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
20/09/23, 4:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
20/09/23, 4:12 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Noted
20/09/23, 4:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
20/09/23, 4:18 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Yes we are together
20/09/23, 4:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
20/09/23, 4:18 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Clear on that
20/09/23, 4:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
20/09/23, 4:24 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Clear
20/09/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
20/09/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 04th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 04th November 2023.*
20/09/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $750 within 15 working days by *04th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
20/09/23, 4:28 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Noted
20/09/23, 4:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
20/09/23, 4:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
20/09/23, 4:30 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Yes I reside in Harare
20/09/23, 4:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you are able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
20/09/23, 4:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
20/09/23, 4:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
20/09/23, 4:34 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Alright 
Thank you
21/09/23, 10:25 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Natalie!
I hope you are doing well today.
21/09/23, 10:25 am - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since I got occupied in an urgent meeting that came up. Now, I appreciate your patience here and let us move ahead with our discussion here.
21/09/23, 10:27 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
21/09/23, 1:19 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Yes please
21/09/23, 3:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, if making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333038009240398
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
21/09/23, 3:20 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Thank you
21/09/23, 3:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
21/09/23, 3:24 pm - +263 71 341 1286: This message was deleted
21/09/23, 3:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Natalie, may I know if you are clear till here dear?
21/09/23, 3:26 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Yes I am thank you
21/09/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
21/09/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
21/09/23, 5:24 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Yes sir I’m clear
22/09/23, 1:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Natalie!
I hope you are doing well today.
22/09/23, 1:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
22/09/23, 1:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

22/09/23, 2:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
22/09/23, 2:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa. 

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

27/09/23, 10:19 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Natalie!
I hope you are doing well today.
27/09/23, 10:19 am - Milan Edoofa: From the discussion that we had here earlier, I believe you are clear till here about the fee as well as when they would be required. Now, on that note, can you please also let me know by when are you planning to complete the payment of your registration fee so that you can secure the seat at the university?
28/09/23, 7:05 am - +263 77 236 9938: Please assist me.Are we able to pay $1400 which is per semester.Why am asking is we still have extra costs for her visa and air ticket.
28/09/23, 9:10 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Natalie!
I hope you are doing well today.
28/09/23, 9:11 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your query with me here, however, can you please help me understand the same in a better way about the main concern that you have here please so that I can help you in getting a clarity on that.
29/09/23, 7:06 am - +263 77 236 9938: Good morning.My question is are we able to pay per semester or it has to be the whole year
29/09/23, 10:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Natalie!
I hope you are doing well today.
29/09/23, 10:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for clarifying that for me here. Now, regarding that, when it comes to the balance fee, you can pay it in two equal parts in every semester please. This means that you don't have to pay all of it at once. I hope this is clear?
29/09/23, 10:14 am - +263 77 236 9938: Some universities require  the full payment for first years so I wanted to know if the University requires full payment for first year or I can pay per semester
Like tuition instead of $1800 per annum I pay $900 for the semester
Then $100 for exam fee per semester 
$800 for off campus accomodation and $400 per semester 
The question is if I'm able to pay amounts per semester and not per annum because I still have other expenses to cover
29/09/23, 10:18 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for clarifying your concern about the payment structure. I understand that some universities require full payment for the first year, but I can confirm that Galgotias University does allow you to pay certain expenses on a per-semester basis. Here's a breakdown of how you can handle these costs:

1. Tuition: Instead of paying $1800 per annum, you can pay $900 for each semester. This will help you manage your expenses more effectively.

2. Exam Fee: You can pay $100 per semester for the exam fee, making it easier to budget for these costs.

3. Off-Campus Accommodation: Off-campus accommodation expenses are typically paid on a monthly basis rather than per semester. Therefore, I believe it would be much easier for you to do that on monthly basis. 

I believe you are clear with these points, right?
29/09/23, 10:21 am - +263 77 236 9938: Yes thank you
29/09/23, 10:21 am - +263 77 236 9938: When can I pay registration fee?
29/09/23, 10:23 am - Milan Edoofa: On that note, can you please let me know by when would you be able to do that please?
29/09/23, 10:24 am - +263 77 236 9938: Before 4 October
29/09/23, 10:24 am - +263 77 236 9938: Will pay half and finish off 4 November
29/09/23, 10:25 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know. Do you also have a fixed date for me about by when would you be able to pay the first part?
29/09/23, 10:26 am - +263 77 236 9938: 2 October
29/09/23, 10:34 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting us know. I will update the university officials as well. We are done with our sessions for now and since you now have an offer letter with you, the next step for you is to pay your university registration fee as per the deadline shared and reserve the scholarship seat.
						
After making the payment, kindly send us the receipt so that we can confirm it with the accounts team and inform the university officials. Don't hesitate to contact us if you require any assistance.
29/09/23, 10:34 am - Milan Edoofa: That being said, we will end our conversation for today. Have a wonderful day and please convey our greetings to your family as well!

22/12/23, 6:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As we have shared that one of our partnered universities, Lovely Professional University (LPU), which is among the top 100 universities in India, has been considering your application for the scholarship opportunity. They have mentioned that they would be able to give us an update by the month of January, considering the high volume of applications they have received in the past two months (more than 2000 applications).
22/12/23, 6:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In addition to this, the academic board also mentioned that there are a few more universities willing to put your application in consideration for scholarship opportunities in the month of January. Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter. This approach allows you to have multiple scholarship options, giving you the flexibility to decide on the university for your education in India and then carry out your visa application process the right way.
22/12/23, 6:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this update, I also want to inform you that since we are waiting for updates from the universities, we will be holding our conversation until 20th January and will reconnect around the same time. Until then, we wanted to share these updates with you so that you are well-informed about the process and know what lies ahead. We are thrilled to be a part of this new chapter in your academic journey.
