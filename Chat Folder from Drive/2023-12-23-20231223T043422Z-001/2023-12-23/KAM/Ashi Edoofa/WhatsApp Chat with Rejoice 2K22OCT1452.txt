09/09/23, 8:33 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Rejoice,

I hope this message finds you well. I am *Mr. Shivjeet, Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As per our commitment, following the successful closure of the 2023 intake, I am delighted to inform you that we are now fully prepared to commence the university application process for your higher studies, targeting the intake of 2024. 

Before we embark on your admission journey, I'd like to inquire about your well-being and that of your family. How have the past few months been for you and your family?

14/09/23, 8:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. Shall we proceed with the session?
14/09/23, 8:38 pm - +263 77 448 1283: Yes Sir
14/09/23, 8:41 pm - +263 77 345 9495: This message was deleted
14/09/23, 8:43 pm - +263 77 345 9495: Good evening
15/09/23, 3:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
15/09/23, 3:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. As you await your A-Level results, initiating the university admission process now positions you as an early applicant. This status comes with the advantage of receiving a provisional letter of intent from the university. This letter will outline your scholarship percentage and associated fees. Once you complete your registration formalities and your results are available, you'll be provided with your Official Admission Letter. This letter will enable you to proceed with your student visa application. I trust this point is now clear to you.
15/09/23, 3:40 pm - +263 77 448 1283: Very clear sir
15/09/23, 3:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
15/09/23, 3:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Students now have the reamrkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This can be achieved by making an early decision to initiate the university admission process and securing your seat in advance. By taking this step, you can avail the early decision benefits previously mentioned. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
15/09/23, 3:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
15/09/23, 3:45 pm - +263 77 448 1283: Yes Sir I understand
15/09/23, 3:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
15/09/23, 3:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be skillfully adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
15/09/23, 3:58 pm - +263 77 448 1283: Yes sir
15/09/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, we're offering the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
15/09/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
15/09/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 18, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 18, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 18, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
15/09/23, 3:59 pm - +263 77 448 1283: No Sir. I understand the whole process
15/09/23, 4:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
15/09/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 448 1283: I would appreciate it if you share it with me
15/09/23, 4:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student decides to initiate their admission process before receiving their A-Level results, they gain the advantage of early registration benefits. At this stage, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from entities like Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship percentage as promised.
15/09/23, 4:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there might be a scenario where the student might not achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels. 

In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship. However, if a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university with early decision benefits, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged.
15/09/23, 4:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On the other hand, if a student manages to achieve a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application once the results are available. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how this gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process as per the standard procedures?
15/09/23, 4:03 pm - +263 77 448 1283: Yes sir I understand
06/10/23, 12:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afteroon, Parents and my dear student.

I extend my gratitude for your understanding and patience. I trust you are in good health and high spirits. Please accept my apologies for the delay in communication over the past few days. As we approached the end of the intake year in 2023, my focus was on facilitating the smooth arrival and integration of new students.

With that in mind, I am eager to reconnect and prioritize our upcoming session scheduled for this Monday at 3:00 PM. I anticipate a productive and engaging discussion. Wishing you a wonderful weekend ahead, and please convey my warm regards to your cherished family.
06/10/23, 12:53 pm - +263 77 448 1283: Good afternoon Sir
09/10/23, 11:13 am - +263 77 448 1283: Good morning Sir. I hope i find you well this morning.

I would like to inform you that i won't be able to make it for today's scheduled session at 3pm as i have an exam at the same time.

Sorry for the inconveniences caused. Have a lovely day ahead.
09/10/23, 2:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and My dear student. 

I trust you had a restful weekend with your family. May I kindly inquire if you are presently available to continue with our session?
09/10/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 345 9495: Afternoon how are you doing yes please
09/10/23, 4:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
09/10/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 345 9495: Yes we are aware of that
11/10/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 448 1283: Yes Sir
11/10/23, 3:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
11/10/23, 3:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
11/10/23, 3:44 pm - +263 77 448 1283: Very clear Sir
11/10/23, 3:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
11/10/23, 3:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education? <This message was edited>
11/10/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 448 1283: I would like to enquire for the same Sir. The costs for the admission process and for the higher education
11/10/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Sure for that you will be able to get the detailed information once you have received your offer letter from the universities.
11/10/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 448 1283: Okay Sir
11/10/23, 4:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the Early Decision Benefits. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
11/10/23, 4:27 pm - +263 77 448 1283: Yes sir im ready
11/10/23, 4:27 pm - +263 77 345 9495: We are ready
11/10/23, 4:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Rejoice's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
11/10/23, 4:38 pm - +263 77 448 1283: Okay Sir. Thank you
14/10/23, 10:02 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Rejoice.

14/10/23, 10:02 am - Milan Edoofa: The university will soon send you the official offer letter. However, we've received it in advance and couldn't wait to share this exhilarating news. Please take your time to review the letter thoroughly.

How are you doing today? May I know if you have been able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
15/10/23, 11:58 am - +263 77 448 1283: Mr Millan i hope you are doing well.

With regards to Admission and Procedure fee , could you please elaborate i missed that one 

Also about the $750 is it going to be paid now before the 15days or somethin. Does the endowment plan still exist that Edoofa pays the $150 and the students pays $600 for early registration.

Also about hostel fees is it excluded from the Tuition fee . I mean according to my understanding my Tuition fee is $1800 per annum and $900 per semester and the hostel fees for 2seaters is $2500 and for 3seaters is $2000. Is it included at my Tuition fee or its paid differently?

And can i please have contact numbers of any  students studying at Galgotias university
15/10/23, 12:00 pm - +263 77 448 1283: Yes we did sir
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm sorry for going offline during our conversation earlier. I wasn't feeling well with a fever and had to take medicine. I'm back now and ready to continue with our conversation.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing all that information with me. Now, stay assured that I will help you in getting the clarity about the same further during our discussion please. For now, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
15/10/23, 11:42 pm - +263 77 448 1283: Sorry for the late response Sir 


1. $900
2. 3years
3. $300
4. $750
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Rejoice!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across three years. This academic journey is divided into 6 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
16/10/23, 11:33 am - +263 77 448 1283: Yes Sir
16/10/23, 11:38 am - +263 77 448 1283: We are doing fine thanks for asking
16/10/23, 11:54 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
16/10/23, 11:54 am - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different.

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
16/10/23, 11:54 am - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
16/10/23, 11:55 am - +263 77 345 9495: Morning how are you doing sir
16/10/23, 11:57 am - +263 77 448 1283: Is the money included on the Tuition fee ?
16/10/23, 11:58 am - +263 77 448 1283: Okay Sir
16/10/23, 1:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: No, please dear. The accommodation costs are different from the tuition fee and are not included in the same. Since it is considered as a personal expense of the student. I hope this is clear?
16/10/23, 3:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
16/10/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 448 1283: Is there someone with a Mukuru account incase we can't make it to Harare?
16/10/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 448 1283: Its okay Sir. You can do that as well
16/10/23, 3:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
16/10/23, 3:37 pm - +263 77 448 1283: Thank you Sir
16/10/23, 3:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
16/10/23, 3:39 pm - +263 77 448 1283: Clear Sir
16/10/23, 3:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
16/10/23, 3:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
16/10/23, 3:42 pm - +263 77 448 1283: Yes sir. Clear
16/10/23, 3:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.	
	
With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
16/10/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 448 1283: Yes Sir
16/10/23, 3:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
16/10/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 448 1283: I don't have queries sir. I wanted to know if there is anyone with a Mukuru account incase we don't make it to Harare to pay the admission fee
16/10/23, 3:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, you can make the payment to Mr. Charles using Mukuru as well, shall I share his Mukuru details with you here?
16/10/23, 3:56 pm - +263 77 448 1283: Sure sir
16/10/23, 3:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Sure, Here are the Mukuru account details
