Please mark this date on your calendars.
25/08/23, 8:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To ensure your absolute readiness for the start of your EWYL Program on the upcoming Monday, a meticulous four-day process has been laid out. Your enthusiastic participation is pivotal to ensuring the seamless execution of this process. If everything is falling into place so far shall we move forward and commence our discussion for the day?
25/08/23, 8:12 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Noted ma'am
25/08/23, 8:12 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Sure, thank you.
25/08/23, 8:13 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Let's move forward
25/08/23, 8:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. Now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
25/08/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Tafadzwa 2K23AUG1722R)* will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
25/08/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Tafadzwa EWYL23E0588)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits. 

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. However, you will be provided with a dedicated EWYL line as well, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups?
25/08/23, 8:15 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Clearly explained,  thank you ma'am
25/08/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups. Moving forward, It's reassuring to hear that. I had a recent conversation with your counselor, Mr. Sahil during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and your career aspirations. I must commend your family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring that you have access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
25/08/23, 8:23 pm - +263 78 833 7215: The Earn While You Learn Program (EWYL)
25/08/23, 8:26 pm - +263 78 833 7215: I've understood that EWYL helps the students to learn and develop their skills necessary for the digital working environment.
25/08/23, 8:32 pm - +263 78 833 7215: From my own understanding Earn While You Learn is considered to be the backbone of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.  It is also regarded as the most valuable form of learning which comes from action and practical learning. With EWYL program EDOOFA will be preparing the students for the real world and also assisting students to earn scholarship credits in the process, therefore  reducing the cost of their education expenses
25/08/23, 8:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you had such a great understanding and indeed you have a great understanding of the EWYL program and absolutely through EWYL students get to learn more about 21st-century skills that are necessary for today's world to be employable.

28/08/23, 12:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing well too and I am glad to know that you are doing well. Great, Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
28/08/23, 12:41 pm - +263 78 833 7215: I'm ever ready,  we may start ma'am
28/08/23, 2:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/08/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 833 7215: I'm done ma'am
28/08/23, 3:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
28/08/23, 3:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
28/08/23, 3:48 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Sure ma'am
28/08/23, 3:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
28/08/23, 3:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
28/08/23, 3:49 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Following
28/08/23, 3:49 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Yes ma'am
28/08/23, 3:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
28/08/23, 3:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
28/08/23, 3:50 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Clearly explained,  thank you ma'am.
28/08/23, 3:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
28/08/23, 3:55 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Yes ma'am
28/08/23, 4:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
28/08/23, 4:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
28/08/23, 4:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you are ready, shall I share the videos with you here now?
28/08/23, 4:06 pm - +263 78 833 7215: I'm ready
28/08/23, 4:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.
28/08/23, 4:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
28/08/23, 4:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

28/08/23, 4:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
28/08/23, 4:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
28/08/23, 4:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
28/08/23, 4:13 pm - +263 78 833 7215: If my network allows me I be done by 5:00pm CAT today
28/08/23, 4:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, in that case, let us reconnect today at 09.00 p.m. I hope by that time you will be able to go through the videos by that time.
28/08/23, 4:22 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Sure, thank you ma'am. Stay blessed, later.
28/08/23, 4:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, thank you for kind words, have a great day.
28/08/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, with regard to our conversation, may I know if you were able to go through the videos by now?
28/08/23, 9:00 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Yes ma'am
28/08/23, 9:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so can you please share your understanding of the videos?
28/08/23, 9:09 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Yes ma'am
28/08/23, 9:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, I shall wait for your response to the videos.
28/08/23, 9:14 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Edoofians should be students who are driven by a clear sense of purpose and a genuine passion for their chosen field of study. Additionally, Edoofians should share their unique perspectives with the global academic community by highlighting their multicultural experiences, language skills, or involvement in exchange programmes to show their adaptability, intercultural competence, and capacity to thrive in a variety of settings.
28/08/23, 9:21 pm - +263 78 833 7215: The goal of Edoofa is to develop environments for learning where each student may reach their full potential. Additionally, to link committed and professional students with some of the world's professionals to increase their performance and productivity.  To motivate mankind. To nurture independence and focus among students.
28/08/23, 9:37 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Before commenting my reviews allow me to applaud for this video, everything is well and clearly explained.
28/08/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, you have clearly understood the video.
28/08/23, 9:41 pm - +263 78 833 7215: The SOP is important because it is a good opportunity to speak with the admissions counsellor about one's interests. Either  academic or professional interests. This can make one a more appealing candidate while also providing the admissions officer with the information they need to help one to achieve his or her  goals
28/08/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding, I shall wait for your response to the 3rd video.
28/08/23, 9:51 pm - +263 78 833 7215: I've understood that the Edoofa program has created systems to identify and ovserve the best schools in India which offers the best education
28/08/23, 9:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
28/08/23, 9:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
28/08/23, 9:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
28/08/23, 9:57 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Thank you ma'am
28/08/23, 9:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
28/08/23, 9:58 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Im following
28/08/23, 9:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Tomorrow at 01.00 pm.
28/08/23, 9:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

29/08/23, 2:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tafadzwa.

I hope you are doing well, Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
29/08/23, 2:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
29/08/23, 2:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a degree in the course Diploma in Business Administration for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
29/08/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Yes ma'am
29/08/23, 2:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
29/08/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 833 7215: I'm ready ma'am
29/08/23, 2:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
29/08/23, 2:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
29/08/23, 2:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
29/08/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Noted
29/08/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Yes ma'am
29/08/23, 2:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
29/08/23, 2:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
29/08/23, 2:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
29/08/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Sure, he did
29/08/23, 2:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
29/08/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Yes
29/08/23, 2:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
29/08/23, 2:36 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Yes
29/08/23, 2:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
29/08/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Following ma'am
29/08/23, 2:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
29/08/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Not yet ma'am
29/08/23, 2:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Alright, now Tafadzwa, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Monday so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well. <This message was edited>
29/08/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Thank you ma'am
29/08/23, 2:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome
30/08/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tafadzwa.

I hope you are doing well, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
30/08/23, 2:32 pm - +263 78 833 7215: I'm doing well, how are you?
30/08/23, 2:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing well, and I am glad to know that you are doing well too. May I know if you are available for a discussion now?
30/08/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Yes
30/08/23, 2:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. Moving forward, I recently reviewed your application form once again and noted your preference to commence your EWYL journey in August 2023. Considering the fact that we start with the EWYL on Monday as informed to you before, we are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Monday which is 4th September 2023.
30/08/23, 2:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the meantime, we will focus on your admission journey. Now that you have a clear understanding of the admission process, I encourage you to have a discussion with your family regarding the financial requirements. This will allow them to plan effectively and move in the right direction.
30/08/23, 2:42 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Thank you
30/08/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Noted
30/08/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Given that your university admission is scheduled for the August 2024 intake, our next step is to reconnect with you and discuss when to commence the same journey. I am sure you and your parents were able to have a discussion of the financial requirements by now?
30/08/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Yes
30/08/23, 2:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you have any concerns or queries regarding the admission process?
30/08/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Not at the moment
30/08/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, may I know if your parents are also available for the discussion?
30/08/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 833 7215: I believe they're
30/08/23, 2:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Now that you have comprehended the university admission process, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
30/08/23, 2:47 pm - +263 78 833 7215: No ma'am
30/08/23, 2:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *I understand Tafadzwa, it is alright, let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.

For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pau would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
 
As Edoofa gave you the word throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
30/08/23, 2:50 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Sure
30/08/23, 2:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing to hear that, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
30/08/23, 2:51 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Yes ma'am
30/08/23, 2:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
30/08/23, 3:30 pm - +263 78 833 7215: No ma'am
30/08/23, 3:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:

1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.
2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.
3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.
4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.
30/08/23, 3:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For students who are yet to write their O-Level Exams, choosing the early decision benefits brings two additional advantages:

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the O-level Examination and plans to take a gap year to retake the exams, they will be able to be admitted for the 2025 intake.
6. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.

*The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program*
30/08/23, 3:42 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Following
30/08/23, 3:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
30/08/23, 3:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them. Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
30/08/23, 3:46 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Yes ma'am
30/08/23, 3:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Each year the universities revise their fee structure and it is highly possible that the fee would be increased for the academic year 2024. Over the past few years, we have seen a hike of 20%-30% in the tuition fee and to help our students from the same, students have been given the opportunity to keep their fee structure as per the current academic year of 2023.
30/08/23, 3:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here, if you make the early decision to start with your university admission process and decide to reserve your seat with the university earlier, you will be able to get the above-mentioned early decision benefit and this would help you keep your fee structure the same for the complete course of your bachelor’s education in India.
30/08/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even if the fee increases for your admission intake which is 2024, you would be protected against that and your fee will be in accordance with 2023. Are we on the same page here?
30/08/23, 3:56 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Wow, I'm impressed
30/08/23, 3:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now allow me to move forward to the next step.

3. Here, when you receive the Letter of Intent (Offer Letter) from the university, the registration fee would be mentioned, so by the grant of $150 means, if your registration fee is $750, then the actual registration fee that you have to pay will be only $600. 

Once the payment of $600 is made by you, the complete amount of $750 will be adjusted against your first-year university fee since we will be paying the $150 to the university on your behalf. Have you understood?
30/08/23, 4:14 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Yes ma'am
30/08/23, 4:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. If your finances aren't prepared, and you need some time, in such cases, *Edoofa* is giving the option to make the payment of the Registration fee in 2 parts, the first part i.e. 50% of the registration fee after the grant of $150, has to be paid within the time period mentioned by the university and the second part i.e. the remaining 50% of the registration fee has to be paid within 30 days from the first deadline date. 

For example, if your deadline is 30th August 2023, and your registration fee after the grant is $600, then you have to pay $300 on or before 30th August 2023, and the remaining $300 has to be paid by 30th September 2023. Any queries so far?
30/08/23, 4:16 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Yes ma'am
30/08/23, 4:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, may I know if you were able to go through the message here?
30/08/23, 4:25 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Not at the moment
30/08/23, 4:25 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Yes ma'am
30/08/23, 4:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through all 4 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 4 points clear?
30/08/23, 7:49 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Good evening ma'am 
Sorry i was facing network challenges 
All the points are clear
30/08/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is fine I understand. Alright, I’m glad to know that you have understood all of this well! Now, I would like you to take some time and have a discussion with your parents concerning the next steps in your university admission journey and update them about the benefits of the early decision. I am sure they would be excited and open to the same opportunity. We shall reconnect on Friday at 01.00 p.m. To carry forward your admission process.

02/09/23, 10:33 am - +263 77 405 5972: Morning , yes we are available
02/09/23, 10:40 am - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you are doing well, so may I know if you were able to have a discussion on the Early Decision Benefits and what are your thoughts regarding the same?
02/09/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 405 5972: Early decision benefits its worthy because it increases chances of being accepted
02/09/23, 5:49 pm - +263 77 341 1055: Afternoon  ,sorry  for my late  response. As parents we are thankful.
04/09/23, 4:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tafadzwa.

I hope you are doing well, Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you earlier as it was the weekend, I want to inform you that we will be having our discussion today at 09.00 pm, I hope you will be available.
04/09/23, 4:06 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Good afternoon ma'am. 
Definitely.
04/09/23, 9:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263788337215 Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you earlier, since I was occupied with some personal work we will be connecting on the 6th of September at 01.30 pm since I will not be available tomorrow on the occasion of my Birthday. I hope you will be available.
04/09/23, 10:03 pm - +263 78 833 7215: It's okay ma'am.  Happy birthday in advance, hope all your birthday wishes come true
04/09/23, 10:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you so much, I really appreciate it.
06/09/23, 1:30 pm - +263 77 405 5972: The discussion went well and we ' re hoping to secure a slot as soon as we can be privilleged to all the advantages behind the Early Decision Benefits
06/09/23, 1:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know, indeed. I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.
06/09/23, 1:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due date will be mentioned.
06/09/23, 1:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?*
06/09/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Yes ma'am
06/09/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 405 5972: As parents we are financially prepared
06/09/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is amazing to hear. Alright, please. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
06/09/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
06/09/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
06/09/23, 1:46 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Yes ma'am
06/09/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Now you have two ways to proceed with your child’s university admission process -

*1. Proceed as per the standard procedures*
*2. Proceed with the Early Decision Benefits*

Be assured that I will help you understand the difference between both of them so that you can make a well-informed decision regarding your child’s university admission process. Shall we start with our discussion regarding the same?
06/09/23, 1:55 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Yes
06/09/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Brilliant, let us start with the *Standard Registration/University Admission process*-

As you are aware that one’s registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university, to be on the safer side, let us assume that the registration fee is $750 itself.

As per the standard procedures, once you get the offer letter from the university, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of $750.

For example, if you get the offer letter on the 06th of September and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, the deadline for the registration fee would be the 21st of September 2023 and you would have to make the payment of the fee before then. Are you clear about this?
06/09/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Yes
06/09/23, 2:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, now let us discuss the *Early Registration/University Admission process -*

As the name states, a student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.

If you do that, you are eligible for all 6 benefits that we discussed earlier. Since the benefit number 3 and 4 helps you ease the registration process, I will be discussing the same in particular and help you understand how that happens -

When we talk about the Early Decision Grant of $150 (benefit number 3)
06/09/23, 2:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To understand the same, let us once again assume that the registration fee due is $750 and if you have a grant of $150, this means that out of the fee due of $750, $150 will be paid by the Edoofa Academic Board on your behalf and hence this leaves your child’s fee due as $750 - $150 = $600.

So, the amount that you will have to pay to reserve/lock your child’s scholarship seat becomes $600.
06/09/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Well articulated thank you
06/09/23, 2:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

1. The first part ~ $300 is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 06th of January, the deadline becomes the 21st of September, 2023)

2. The second part ~ $300 is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 06th of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 21st of September 2023, making the second deadline the 21stof October, 2023).

Please let me know if we are on the same page here as well?
06/09/23, 2:12 pm - +263 78 833 7215: This is amazing
06/09/23, 2:12 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Yes ma'am
06/09/23, 8:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you earlier, as I was attending a meeting, May I know if you and your parents are available to connect with us now?
06/09/23, 8:03 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Greetings, yes
06/09/23, 8:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you have any concerns so far?
06/09/23, 8:04 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Not at the moment ma'am
06/09/23, 8:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
06/09/23, 8:10 pm - +263 78 833 7215: I've understood ma'am, both the admission procedures are clear
06/09/23, 8:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, now before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
06/09/23, 8:13 pm - +263 78 833 7215: On it ma'am
06/09/23, 8:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Sure, I shall wait for your response.
06/09/23, 8:49 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Admission process begins as soon as the parents agree that they're financially and mentally stable 
1. Standard procedures in this procedure doesn't have flexibility as it is required to pay the registration fee once without installments 
E.g: if the registration fee is $750 you would be given a period of 15days to make payment of your complete registration fee of $750 at once 
2.Early Decision Benefits 
Assuming that the registration fee is $750 with Early Decision Benefits one will get an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due. In this procedure there's no financial pressure of making the payment in one go as there's an option of making the payment of the registration fee in 2 parts over a period of 30days
06/09/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days. 

4. With the standard admission process, as a student you are not paying any more fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until your parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with your admission process.

Please let me know if you are clear on this?
06/09/23, 9:02 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Yes ma'am
06/09/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
06/09/23, 9:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Monday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.

When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *21st September* and *21st October*.
06/09/23, 9:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, If you as parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines (*21st September* and *21st October*), you can give us the go-ahead so that we can prepare NAME’s application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
06/09/23, 9:09 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Once the parents are online they will surely reply
06/09/23, 9:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall wait for their response.
06/09/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 405 5972: As parents we are ready
06/09/23, 9:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great @263774055972 so could you please give us a (green light/go-ahead) for Tafadzwa's application for the scholarship?
07/09/23, 4:21 am - +263 77 405 5972: Kindly proceced with the next step
08/09/23, 10:33 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tafadzwa!

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa, and today, I have some incredible news to share with you all!

Take your time to review the letter and then once you are done going through it, we will then have a discussion about the letter in detail and address any questions or concerns you may have. Congratulations on this prestigious offer and securing a scholarship! Your hard work has truly paid off! ⭐🌟
08/09/23, 10:33 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/09/23, 11:48 am - +263 78 833 7215: Greetings Mr Milan
08/09/23, 12:07 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Thank you so much
08/09/23, 12:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome dear. Now, once you go through the offer letter, please let me know.
08/09/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 833 7215: I'm done Sir
08/09/23, 2:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any queries you have. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
08/09/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 833 7215: On the first page my passport number is *AE509494*
 Tentative start date should be August 2024
On the due date it is stated that should be paid within 30days or before the 10th of September and I believe the 10th of September is the date after tomorrow so may you please clarify this 
On page 3 it's supposed to be *Ms* not Mr
08/09/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Also on the Acceptance of Offer letter the start date stated is August 2023 which I belive it is supposed to be August 2024
08/09/23, 2:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please Tafadzwa, you do not have to worry about that dear. When it comes to the Passport Number, stay assured that it will be corrected moving ahead. 

Moreover, when it comes to the dates, we will be discussing them now. For us to be able to do that, can you please share the information that I have requested here dear.
08/09/23, 2:52 pm - +263 78 833 7215: 1. 975usd/semester 
2. 3years
3. 200usd
4. 700usd
08/09/23, 2:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 3-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 6 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $975 making your per annum tuition fee ($975*2) = $1950. Is that clear?
08/09/23, 2:52 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Thank you so much Sir
08/09/23, 2:53 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Yes Sir
08/09/23, 2:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -
08/09/23, 2:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
08/09/23, 2:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
08/09/23, 2:55 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Following Sir
08/09/23, 2:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
08/09/23, 2:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?
08/09/23, 2:57 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Yes Sir
08/09/23, 2:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
08/09/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Copy that
08/09/23, 3:04 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Yes Sir
08/09/23, 3:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, Moving forward to the registration fee -

The registration fee which we discussed earlier is $700 for LPU, and your admission processing fee is $200, which is one-time payable. To reserve a scholarship seat with the university one has to pay $700 in total and if you see your offer letter, you are supposed to pay the same fee before 10th September 2023.
08/09/23, 3:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations and the benefits you have as an Edoofian, I am sure you recall that you have the $150 grant along with the privilege to make the payment of the same fee of $700 in two parts as $275 before 22nd September 2023 and $275 before 22nd October 2023.

Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $550 by 22nd September 2023 and complete your university admission process early. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page?
08/09/23, 3:07 pm - +263 78 833 7215: So admission fee and the registration fee it's 900 all in total?
08/09/23, 3:08 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Yes Sir very much clear
08/09/23, 3:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is right! However, the admission fee of $200 is to be paid once you arrive here in India along with the tuition fee please. I hope this is clear?
08/09/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 833 7215: It's now clear thank you Sir
08/09/23, 3:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
08/09/23, 3:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
08/09/23, 3:13 pm - +263 78 833 7215: I'm currently in Kwekwe and my parents are in Masvingo
08/09/23, 3:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, If you are planning to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajasn, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
08/09/23, 3:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
08/09/23, 3:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
08/09/23, 3:15 pm - +263 78 833 7215: We can only make the payments in Harare?
08/09/23, 3:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that, Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
08/09/23, 3:21 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Sure Sir
08/09/23, 3:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
08/09/23, 3:22 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Thank you Sir
08/09/23, 3:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your edsucation more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
08/09/23, 3:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
08/09/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 833 7215: Yes Sir
08/09/23, 3:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?

08/09/23, 3:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable. 

It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.

The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/
