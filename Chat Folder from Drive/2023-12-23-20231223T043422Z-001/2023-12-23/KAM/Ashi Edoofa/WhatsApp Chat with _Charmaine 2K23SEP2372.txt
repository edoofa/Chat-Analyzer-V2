I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
28/09/23, 12:18 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Yes
28/09/23, 12:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/09/23, 12:32 pm - +263 71 368 4800: I have finished going through the image
28/09/23, 12:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
28/09/23, 12:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
28/09/23, 12:39 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Yes
28/09/23, 12:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
28/09/23, 12:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
28/09/23, 12:46 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Yes
28/09/23, 12:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
28/09/23, 12:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
28/09/23, 12:49 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Yes they are
28/09/23, 12:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
28/09/23, 12:57 pm - +263 71 368 4800: What do you mean. By you pay the same
28/09/23, 12:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263713684800 Let me help you understand. This registration fee of $500 to $750 is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first-year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
28/09/23, 1:04 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Yes
28/09/23, 1:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
28/09/23, 2:09 pm - +263 71 368 4800: I do not have any
28/09/23, 2:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
28/09/23, 2:27 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Yes
28/09/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
28/09/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
28/09/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you are ready, shall I share the videos with you here now?
28/09/23, 2:30 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Yes
28/09/23, 2:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.
28/09/23, 2:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
29/09/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
29/09/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
29/09/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* I could see from your answer that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
29/09/23, 3:01 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Well understood

02/10/23, 7:37 am - +263 71 368 4800: Question 2 
Zimbabwe has strong foundations for accelerating future economic growth and improving living standards. However,Zimbabwe's economic development continues to be hampered by price and exchange rate instability, misallocation of productive resources, high informality, low investment, and limited structural transformation.Being a future development practioner,I want people in my country to experience true nature . Global warming is being experienced in Zimbabwe and I would love to promote the planting of trees in my country.Agriculturenis the backbone of the Zimbabwean country and through this, the country can survive sustainably taking care of the present and future generation.Cyclones like Cyclone Idai occured and affected the Chimanimani region in Zimbabwe.I would promote early warning systems to preserve peoples lives as human life is very important.
02/10/23, 7:56 am - +263 71 368 4800: Question 3
The relationship between humans and the environment is interlinked .Humans rely on the environment for survival using it's resources to survive sustainably. We live on the environment, building infrastructures and in the southern Africa we still have people who live in caves example the Khoisan.We get food from the environmentbe it fruits or foods that we grow through agricultural practices. Humans also get clean air from the environment thus through oxygen from trees.The environment also acts as a sink as forests absorb carbon dioxide which will be impure .The oceans are also examples of carbon sinks .Humans also get money from the environment through it's asthetic beauty.Example in Zimbabwe foreigners come to see Victoria falls generating income. In return the environment gets care and protection.In Zimbabwe animals like rhinos  are well looked after as they are about to get extinct. Humans also take care of the environment by irrigating plants to include flowers promoting asthetic beauty
02/10/23, 9:11 am - +263 71 368 4800: Question 4
In geography, places can be connected to each other through various means.To begin with 
Transportation networks. Places can be connected through roads, railways, airports, and ports. These networks facilitate the movement of people, goods, and ideas between different locations.
To add on Communication systems connect places.  Places can be connected through communication systems such as the internet, telephone lines, and satellite communications. These systems enable people to communicate and exchange information across different locations. For instance, emails, video calls.
Moreso  Trade and economic ties connect places through trade and economic activities. Through the exchange of goods and services, places develop economic interdependence. For instance, a country may export agricultural products to another country in exchange for manufactured goods. This creates connections and relationships between different places based on their economic needs and resources.
4. Cultural interactions connect placesPlaces can be connected through cultural interactions, such as migration, tourism, and cultural exchange programs. When people move from one place to another, they bring their cultural practices, beliefs, and traditions with them. This leads to the blending of different cultures and the exchange of ideas and experiences.
To Sum up the above environmental factors connect places  through , rivers, mountains, and climate patterns. These natural features can shape the movement and interaction between places. For example, a river can act as a transportation route and provide water for agriculture, connecting communities along its course.
Overall, the connections between places in geography are influenced by transportation networks, communication systems, trade and economic ties, cultural interactions, and environmental factors. These connections contribute to the interdependence and interrelation of different locations on a local, regional, and global scale.
02/10/23, 10:20 am - +263 71 368 4800: Question 5 
A geographic information system (GIS) is a computer system for capturing, storing, checking, and displaying data related to positions on Earth's surface. By relating seemingly unrelated data, GIS can help individuals and organizations better understand spatial patterns and relationships.
GIS improves environmental management by providing a platform to store,analyze and visualize environmental data.GIS also shows population density example it shows a city population showing distribution of people.

Moreso GIS, Enhances Emergency response and Disaster management by providing real time information about location and extent of by a disaster .It helps first responders to quickly assess the situation and make informed decisions about the best course to take.
Furthermore,GIS provides a a platform to store and analyze customer data GIS helps business to make informed decisions about their operations and marketing strategies.

02/10/23, 2:09 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Question number 1
03/10/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Charmaine.

I hope you are in good health. Kindly excuse me for not contacting you earlier, as we had a long weekend followed by a national holiday on Monday, which was Gandhi Jayanti. Gandhi Jayanti is an annual national holiday in India celebrated on October 2nd to commemorate the birthday of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi. He was a prominent leader in the Indian independence movement against British rule and a strong believer in Nonviolence, which helped India to active Political and Social changes.
03/10/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the long weekend and the national holiday, it was impossible for us to connect with you during that period. However, we are available now. May I kindly inquire if you are currently available?
03/10/23, 1:24 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Yes we are available
03/10/23, 1:24 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Noted
03/10/23, 1:24 pm - +263 71 368 4800: We are fine thank you
03/10/23, 1:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
03/10/23, 1:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
03/10/23, 1:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelor of Arts in Geography for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
03/10/23, 1:32 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Yes
03/10/23, 1:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
03/10/23, 1:37 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Yes
03/10/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
03/10/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
03/10/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
03/10/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
03/10/23, 1:45 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Yes
03/10/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
03/10/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
03/10/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
03/10/23, 1:49 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Yes
03/10/23, 1:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
03/10/23, 1:51 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Yes
03/10/23, 2:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
03/10/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 293 1113: Yes understood
03/10/23, 2:13 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Yes noted
03/10/23, 2:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
03/10/23, 2:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
03/10/23, 2:29 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Understood
03/10/23, 2:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
03/10/23, 2:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
03/10/23, 2:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
03/10/23, 2:34 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Well understood
03/10/23, 2:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
03/10/23, 2:37 pm - +263 71 368 4800: I have no questions yet ..
03/10/23, 2:37 pm - +263 71 368 4800: You can proceed
03/10/23, 2:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I am glad to know that. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
03/10/23, 2:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
03/10/23, 2:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
03/10/23, 2:50 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Noted with thanks
03/10/23, 3:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Before Starting with our discussion I would like to congratulate you on completing Steps 2 and 3 and I would like to share your EWYL group link.

05/10/23, 12:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the meantime may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
05/10/23, 12:45 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Yes
05/10/23, 12:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
05/10/23, 12:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
05/10/23, 12:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
05/10/23, 1:11 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Well understood
05/10/23, 1:11 pm - +263 71 368 4800: You can proceed
05/10/23, 1:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
05/10/23, 1:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of Blessing's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
05/10/23, 1:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means @263713684800 , as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
05/10/23, 1:18 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Well understood
05/10/23, 1:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
05/10/23, 1:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
05/10/23, 1:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/10/23, 1:20 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Yes
05/10/23, 1:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
05/10/23, 1:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/10/23, 1:21 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Yes
05/10/23, 1:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
05/10/23, 1:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
05/10/23, 1:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
05/10/23, 1:23 pm - +263 71 368 4800: So far so good ,well understood
05/10/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
05/10/23, 1:25 pm - +263 71 368 4800: I  have now queries at the moment
05/10/23, 1:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now as your guardian, I am sure parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
05/10/23, 1:28 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Yes indeed
05/10/23, 1:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
05/10/23, 1:30 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Noted with thanks
05/10/23, 1:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.
14/10/23, 8:45 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Charmaine.

With all the efforts we've invested, I'm thrilled to inform you that your application has been accepted by PDM University in India, and they've decided to offer you a scholarship. Congratulations! Your journey to a brighter future starts now!
14/10/23, 8:45 am - Milan Edoofa: The university will soon send you the official offer letter. However, we've received it in advance and couldn't wait to share this exhilarating news. Please take your time to review the letter thoroughly.

In the meantime, I encourage you to note any questions or concerns. Being prepared with your queries will make our discussion more productive.

14/10/23, 8:48 am - +263 71 368 4800: Thank you so. Much
14/10/23, 12:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Charmaine!

May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from PDM University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
14/10/23, 12:49 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Yes we hvve
14/10/23, 1:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from PDM University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
14/10/23, 1:16 pm - +263 71 368 4800: 1. 1165 dollars after the scholarship 
2.1250 Dollars
3.registrstion fee is $750
14/10/23, 1:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, as you can see, after the scholarship your per annum tuition fee is $1165 and your per annum accommodation fee is $1250 which makes your per annum educational fee $1165 +$1250 = $2415. I hope you are clear about this?
14/10/23, 1:25 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Yes
14/10/23, 1:26 pm - +263 71 368 4800: I have a question
14/10/23, 1:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know. Now when we talk about accommodation at PDM University, for the first year, it is recommended that the students opt for the on-campus hostel as they are new to the place and the university is in a better position to assist them with their FRRO.

From the second year, when they are familiar with the place and have made a few friends if they wish, they can move out of the on-campus accommodation and look for accommodation options outside the university campus.
14/10/23, 1:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: If you plan to stay outside the campus, your accommodation fee would be $1000 per annum and will have to be paid to the landlord of the place you stay. The average monthly rent would be $50 to $70 and the cost of food would be $20 to $30. 

This means, with the off-campus accommodation, your per annum cost would reduce to ($1165 + $1000) = $2165. Are you clear with this as well?
14/10/23, 1:53 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Yes
14/10/23, 2:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, now as you are aware of your per annum fee, let me tell you what all facilities are offered by the universities and are covered as per the university's fee structure-

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Food Cost
4. Library Fee
5. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
6. Gymnasium Fee
7. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
14/10/23, 2:15 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Well noted
14/10/23, 2:15 pm - +263 71 368 4800: ??
14/10/23, 3:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, what is your question please?
14/10/23, 3:12 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Is there a possibility of getting a scholarship a bit more than 50 percent were I cma grt a fee less than that I have been provided with
14/10/23, 3:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I believe you were aware of the fact the cost of your higher education after the scholarship would be from $2000-3000 please, right?
14/10/23, 3:51 pm - +263 71 368 4800: This message was deleted
14/10/23, 6:44 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Yes
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Charmaine!
I hope you are doing well today.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. On that note, may I know if we can move ahead with our discussion regarding the offer letter now?
16/10/23, 1:05 am - +263 71 368 4800: Yes
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Charmaine!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that please. Moving ahead, I believe you are clear till here, right?
16/10/23, 11:29 am - +263 71 368 4800: Yes
16/10/23, 11:34 am - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, students under the Edoofa Program have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
16/10/23, 11:34 am - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
16/10/23, 11:40 am - +263 71 368 4800: Yes
16/10/23, 11:57 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2165 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2165 - $1000 = $1165  which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
16/10/23, 12:22 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Yes well understood
16/10/23, 3:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. I hope you are clear till here?
16/10/23, 3:06 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Very clear , you notified us that you would send a number of universities to choose from so we needed clarity since you send us one university only
16/10/23, 3:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear. As of now, your application has been only accepted by PDM University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
16/10/23, 3:58 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Yes
16/10/23, 4:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by PDM, you would lose out on the scholarship from PDM and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
16/10/23, 4:52 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Yes
17/10/23, 1:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Charmaine!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 1:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, Charmaine, may I know if you are aware of what is the transfer option and how is it used for navigating the admission process?
17/10/23, 1:13 pm - +263 77 293 1113: Is there no option of putting in the Universities then we google and chose which one we want.
17/10/23, 1:28 pm - +263 71 368 4800: No can you assist
17/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with PDM by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at PDM without risking losing out on the scholarship.
17/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to PDM to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for PDM, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
17/10/23, 4:34 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Well understood
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Charmaine!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, moving ahead, since you are now clear about how the admission process is navigated, I believe you are ready to move ahead with the next steps in your admission journey?
18/10/23, 1:15 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Yes
18/10/23, 1:15 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Good afternoon
18/10/23, 1:32 pm - +263 77 293 1113: Good afternoon yes waiting to hear more
18/10/23, 2:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Now, before we move ahead, may I know if you are clear till here please?
18/10/23, 2:25 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Yes
18/10/23, 2:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
18/10/23, 2:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
18/10/23, 4:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, once you will make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will provide you with an official receipt of payment that you will have to share with us here in order to confirm the payment. I hope this is clear?
18/10/23, 4:31 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Well noted
18/10/23, 4:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
18/10/23, 4:37 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Yes u can go ahead
18/10/23, 4:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
18/10/23, 4:41 pm - +263 71 368 4800: Well noted
18/10/23, 4:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, before we move forward and conclude our conversation regarding your offer letter from PDM University, may I ask if you have any queries you would like to ask?
18/10/23, 4:42 pm - +263 71 368 4800: So far so good
18/10/23, 4:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. In that case, Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -
18/10/23, 4:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: PDM University stands for Prabhu Dayal Memorial University and is located in Delhi, India. It is a relative university that got the status of a University after a very successful period as an Institution. 

The University status was allocated by the Government in the year 2016 and before that, it was an Institution. This university is located in the Metropolitan City in India with Access to metro connectivity. The University in a short span of 5 years has climbed many ladders and with its success, the Government has built a Metro station that connected the entire city through Metro Rail.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://www.pdm.ac.in/recognition-approval/

18/10/23, 9:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Sure, you can do that please. Now, on that note, I would also encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on them by tomorrow and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.
19/10/23, 10:52 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Charmaine!
I hope you are doing well.

Following our earlier conversation, I believe you and your family must be very excited about the opportunity you have received from PDM University.

I trust that you and your family are doing well today. I am pleased to connect with you today to share some positive updates with you.
22/12/23, 7:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In light of your admission process, As we have shared that one of our partnered universities, Lovely Professional University (LPU), which is among the top 100 universities in India, has been considering your application for the scholarship opportunity. They have mentioned that they would be able to give us an update by the month of January, considering the high volume of applications they have received in the past two months (more than 2000 applications).
22/12/23, 7:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In addition to this, the academic board also mentioned that there are a few more universities willing to put your application in consideration for scholarship opportunities in the month of January. Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter. This approach allows you to have multiple scholarship options, giving you the flexibility to decide on the university for your education in India and then carry out your visa application process the right way.
22/12/23, 7:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this update, I also want to inform you that since we are waiting for updates from the universities, we will be holding our conversation until 20th January and will reconnect around the same time.
