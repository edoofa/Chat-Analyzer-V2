If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
19/10/23, 9:42 am - +263 78 129 8755: Yes we can start
19/10/23, 9:46 am - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 9:47 am - +263 78 129 8755: I'm done
19/10/23, 9:52 am - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
19/10/23, 9:52 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
19/10/23, 9:52 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
19/10/23, 9:52 am - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
19/10/23, 9:55 am - +263 78 129 8755: The two steps are clear
19/10/23, 10:03 am - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
19/10/23, 10:03 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
19/10/23, 10:03 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
19/10/23, 10:03 am - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
19/10/23, 10:06 am - +263 78 129 8755: Yes I'm following  it's well explained
19/10/23, 10:09 am - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
19/10/23, 10:09 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $750.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
19/10/23, 10:09 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
19/10/23, 10:09 am - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
19/10/23, 10:13 am - +263 78 129 8755: Yes they are clear , Ms Ashi
19/10/23, 10:22 am - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
19/10/23, 10:25 am - +263 78 129 8755: Yes we can start
19/10/23, 10:31 am - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.

Thank you for sharing your concern I can truly understand that you're facing some real challenges with your network connectivity and the lack of electricity, making it difficult to respond to the videos.

To address this issue, I'd like to offer a suggestion that might help mitigate the impact of these challenges.

Kindly excuse me for not attending your message yesterday as we have weekend. Although, I am happy to know that you have completed the videos,  I would like to you share your understanding regarding the videos and share some insights with us.
23/10/23, 8:48 am - +263 78 129 8755: I'm fine and you  Ms Ashi?

In the first video  the Edoofa founders emphasized  the  message  to enrolled students giving 2 qualities of an Edoofian which are : 1)Should be teachable and open minded. 
2) Should follow Edoofa instructions.
23/10/23, 8:48 am - +263 78 129 8755: In the Second video  the founders focused on the Vision of Edoofa which is not just to get students affordable quality education and making students employable through tha SEELS program, but it is also focused on increasing student's capacity for success, thus making students more responsible and independent.
23/10/23, 8:48 am - +263 78 129 8755: In the third video, the founders discussed about schools,  colleges and  universities  under the Edoofa Program. They said Students understand that Edoofa has invested  a lot of time to identify good schools,colleges and universities for passionate Edoofians. Founders encourage students to follow instructions so as to prepare and be qualified for these prestigious institutions.
23/10/23, 8:49 am - +263 78 129 8755: In the fourth video the Founders discussed the Preparation for Interactive sessions with School- SOP. They said the Statement of Purpose is an important document students should be prompt in taking action and be diligent filling out the form.
23/10/23, 8:52 am - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263781298755, that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
23/10/23, 8:52 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
23/10/23, 8:53 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
23/10/23, 8:53 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
23/10/23, 8:53 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
23/10/23, 8:53 am - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
23/10/23, 8:55 am - +263 78 129 8755: Yes I agree
23/10/23, 8:56 am - +263 78 129 8755: Thanks Ms Ashi
23/10/23, 8:59 am - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @263781298755. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
23/10/23, 8:59 am - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 09:00 AM.
23/10/23, 9:00 am - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process. Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.

17/11/23, 8:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263781298755 May I know if we are still connected dear?
18/11/23, 2:47 pm - +263 78 129 8755: How are you Ms Ashi
18/11/23, 3:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tadiwanashe, I hope you are doing well. 

I am fine dear thank you for asking, May I please know if you are available for the discussion ?
18/11/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 129 8755: Yes I'm available
18/11/23, 3:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.

The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
18/11/23, 3:46 pm - +263 78 129 8755: Yes it works
18/11/23, 3:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from PDM University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
18/11/23, 3:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
18/11/23, 3:51 pm - +263 78 129 8755: 1. $1165
2. 3years
3. Yes it is
18/11/23, 4:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly, You are absolutely correct, and I hope you had the opportunity to see your registration fees which is $750. Also, Let me provide some additional details regarding your offer letter from PDM University. Following the scholarship, your annual tuition fee amounts to $1165, and your annual accommodation fee amounts to $1250. This results in the per annum cost of education being $2415. I hope this provides you with a clear understanding of the financial aspects of your education?
18/11/23, 4:13 pm - +263 78 129 8755: Yes it's now clear
18/11/23, 4:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Glad to see you following through. Regarding accommodation at PDM University, it is recommended that for the first year, students opt for on-campus hostels since they are new to the area and the university can better assist them with their Foreigner Regional Registration Office (FRRO) requirements.
18/11/23, 4:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: From the second year onward, when they are more familiar with the place and have made friends, if they wish, they have the option to move out of on-campus accommodation and explore the off-campus options.
18/11/23, 4:21 pm - +263 78 129 8755: Alright ,thank  you
18/11/23, 4:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome dear, If you plan to stay outside the campus, your accommodation fee would be reduced to $1000 per annum, paid directly to the landlord. The average monthly rent would be $50 to $70, and the cost of food would be $20 to $30.

With the off-campus accommodation, hence the reduced per annum cost would be $2165 ($1165 tuition fee + $1000 off-campus accommodation). I trust this provides you with clarity on the accommodation options? <This message was edited>
18/11/23, 4:23 pm - +263 78 129 8755: Yes it is  clear
18/11/23, 4:23 pm - +263 78 129 8755: So the registration fees is paid once or in installments
18/11/23, 4:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263781298755 Yes dear, You are absolutely correct as the registration fees are paid in installment and we will discuss more in detail about the registration fees soon, before that let us move forward with our discussion. As you are now familiar with your annual fee at PDM University, let me outline the various facilities and services covered by the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Food Cost
4. Library Fee
5. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
6. Gymnasium Fee
7. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
18/11/23, 4:44 pm - +263 78 129 8755: Okay  thank you Ms Ashi
18/11/23, 4:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @263781298755, Now that we have established that your total annual education cost as $2165, let me also guide you on how we can make her education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
18/11/23, 4:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
18/11/23, 4:49 pm - +263 78 129 8755: Yes its clear
18/11/23, 4:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Glad to see you together with the discussion. With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a student. Imagine that with your hard work you earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
18/11/23, 4:52 pm - +263 78 129 8755: Okay let's move on
18/11/23, 4:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his annual fee, which is $2165. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2165- $1000 = $1165, which will need to be paid by your parents/guardians.
18/11/23, 4:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
18/11/23, 4:54 pm - +263 78 129 8755: Yes it really  clarifies  the  EWYL
18/11/23, 4:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is indeed reassuring to have a shared understanding, and I have complete confidence in your dedication to the EWYL Program. I believe you will work diligently to reduce the cost of your education, and your mentors will offer valuable guidance to help you achieve your academic and financial goals.
18/11/23, 4:56 pm - +263 78 129 8755: Yes I will  try  my  best
18/11/23, 4:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, With this, let us now shift our attention to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter. As previously explained, the registration fee of $750 is not an extra cost, it is included in her first-year educational expenses. Therefore, the amount of the fee you will need to pay once you arrives in India will be as follows:

1. If you go with the *Off-campus accommodation*, this means you only need to pay the tuition fee to the university. Therefore, the fee balance becomes $1165- $750 = $415, and this must be paid in one part within three days of your arrival in India.
18/11/23, 5:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Consequently, If you opt for *On-campus accommodation*, the tuition fee of $1165 and the accommodation fee of $1250 will be required. This totals $2415. After deducting the registration fee, the remaining balance will be $2415 - $750 = $1665. This amount can be paid in two installments of $833 and $832, spaced 6 months apart.

The first installment can be paid either before arrival in India or within three days of arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.
18/11/23, 5:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope this clarifies the fee structure, and are we aligned on these options?
18/11/23, 6:35 pm - +263 78 129 8755: Okay thank you
18/11/23, 6:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear, May I please know if you are available for the further discussion?
18/11/23, 6:46 pm - +263 78 129 8755: Yes I'm available
18/11/23, 6:46 pm - +263 78 129 8755: Its clear
18/11/23, 6:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation @263781298755, Moving forward with the discussion, as outlined in the offer letter, it's required for a student to submit a registration fee of $750 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the deadline date as *November 28th, 2023.*
18/11/23, 6:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In connection to our prior conversation and the benefits extended through the Endowment plan, you may remember the entitlement to a $150 grant applicable toward the registration fee. Also, there's a flexible payment plan available to ease the fee payment. Would you want me to explain its workings?
18/11/23, 6:50 pm - +263 78 129 8755: Yes you should  explain  the  workings
18/11/23, 6:50 pm - +263 78 129 8755: So are there payment plans
18/11/23, 6:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @263781298755, Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, and as a student, you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023*(which is one month from the first deadline date).
18/11/23, 6:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before *November 28th, 2023*

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
18/11/23, 6:53 pm - +263 78 129 8755: It's clear and we are now ina agreement
18/11/23, 6:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @263781298755. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, we can also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
18/11/23, 6:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
18/11/23, 6:54 pm - +263 78 129 8755: No I stay in Mutare , Zimbabwe
18/11/23, 6:55 pm - +263 78 129 8755: So can you the alternative  modes
18/11/23, 6:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
18/11/23, 6:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
18/11/23, 6:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
18/11/23, 6:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can prefer to the payment method through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
18/11/23, 7:00 pm - +263 78 129 8755: I will use Mr Rajan , but it's fine if you  share the  details
18/11/23, 7:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
18/11/23, 7:01 pm - +263 78 129 8755: Okay thank you
18/11/23, 7:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As you mentioned that you want to pay your registration fee through Mr. Rajan. Please note that once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
18/11/23, 7:02 pm - +263 78 129 8755: Okay it's fine thank you
18/11/23, 7:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now, Let me share a few insights into the PDM University with you -

PDM University, short for Prabhu Dayal Memorial University, is a prominent institution located in Delhi, India. It has a remarkable history, having initially operated as an institution before attaining university status in 2016.
18/11/23, 7:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Situated in the bustling metropolis of Delhi, PDM University boasts the advantage of easy access to the city's efficient metro rail system. This achievement signifies the university's significant growth over a mere five years. Its success has been so substantial that it played a pivotal role in the government's decision to construct a metro station, further enhancing the accessibility of the institution to the entire city through the metro rail network.
