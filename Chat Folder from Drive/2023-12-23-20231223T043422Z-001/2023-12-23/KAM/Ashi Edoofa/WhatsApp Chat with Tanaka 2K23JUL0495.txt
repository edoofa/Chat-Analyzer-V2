07/09/23, 4:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Tanaka,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As we had promised that after August 2023, we would proceed with your admission process, I am excited to inform you that we are ready for the commencement of the university application process for your higher studies for the intake of 2024. However, before starting, I would like to know how are you and your family doing and how have you utilized your past few months to plan for Tanaka's higher education?
07/09/23, 6:26 pm - +27 74 691 1637: Greetings to you Ma"am and the  whole of the administration members. I am Tanaka's father.  We are well as a family and we greatly appreciate your greetings. We are so excited to hear that you are commencing with the process of university application and admission. To us its a greater honour as a family. We are prepared to do anything in our capability for Tanaka's tertiary education. Tanaka was busy with the EWYL program for past weeks. He went back to school yesterday. He made arrangements to resume with the EWYL program immediately after completing the final exams around October/November 2023. This term it will be very difficult for Tanaka to have access to the phone and communicate with you since he will be preparing for the final exams. Any communication and update, we are committed to do that on his behalf as the parents.
07/09/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm delighted to hear that you and your family are doing well. It's wonderful to know that you've been keeping in good health and high spirits and I am happy to know that you are working hard for Tanaka's higher education

As we come to the conclusion of the 2023 intake, I'm excited to provide you with a glimpse of our Proud Edoofians. With pride and anticipation, they embark on their higher education journey for the year of intake 2023. Their path is more than just academic; it's a profound journey of personal growth and the relentless pursuit of knowledge. This journey underscores our steadfast commitment to fostering a community where every Edoofian is not only educated but also honored with unwavering respect and care.

30/09/23, 11:44 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Tanaka.

I hope you are doing well, that is alright, kindly excuse me for not connecting with you may I know if you are available to connect with us now?

05/10/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 350 6654: Good afternoon ma'am.  I hope you are getting better. 
Yes, I can connect with you now but Tanaka can not since he is at school
05/10/23, 2:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing well not. Yes please that is alright, I am sure he will be able to go through the conversation once he is back from school.
05/10/23, 2:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 350 6654: Yes ma'am I do remember
05/10/23, 2:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
05/10/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 350 6654: The registration process is done when a student has been offered a place at a university on the chosen program.
In case more than 1 place is found, the student, with the help of the admission team, will choose the best university. 
It is at this time that the scholarship benefits are told to the students.  What they should pay is then paid. The registration fees amount will be taken as part of the University fees.
05/10/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 350 6654: The acceptance letter will be valid upto the due date for payment of registration fees. Failure to meet deadlines the offer will be withdrawn
05/10/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
05/10/23, 2:43 pm - +263 77 350 6654: So far, so good
05/10/23, 2:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. So may I know if you are ready to start with your Admission process for the year 2024?
05/10/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 350 6654: Yes ma'am
05/10/23, 2:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
05/10/23, 2:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one <This message was edited>
05/10/23, 2:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
05/10/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 350 6654: Thank you for the information
05/10/23, 2:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
05/10/23, 2:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
05/10/23, 2:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
05/10/23, 2:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
05/10/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 350 6654: Done we can proceed
05/10/23, 3:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
05/10/23, 3:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of Blessing's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
05/10/23, 3:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means @263773506654 , as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
05/10/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 350 6654: Point of correction: The student is Tanaka and is a male
05/10/23, 3:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the typing error, please.
05/10/23, 3:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now moving ahead with the next point. 


2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
05/10/23, 3:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
05/10/23, 3:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/10/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 350 6654: This is great news. Thank you Edoofa
05/10/23, 3:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. 

3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
05/10/23, 3:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/10/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 350 6654: Understood ma'am
05/10/23, 4:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
05/10/23, 4:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
05/10/23, 4:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
05/10/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 350 6654: Following. Are these dates the exact ones, or is it an example?
05/10/23, 4:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is just a tentative date @263773506654. I hope we are clear now?
05/10/23, 4:20 pm - +263 77 350 6654: Ok yes thank you
05/10/23, 4:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
06/10/23, 5:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tanaka. 

I hope you are doing well, I was hoping to get a response from you however, you did not respond may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
06/10/23, 11:45 pm - +263 77 350 6654: Sorry, I am just seeing the message. I  had no network. 

No, I don't know how it works
07/10/23, 7:48 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Tanaka.

I hope this message finds you well, I understand that messages can be seen at different times due to the network challenge which is a very big challenge, so please do not need to apologize. We can continue with our discussion today if you are available to connect now?
07/10/23, 7:53 am - +263 77 350 6654: Good morning ma'am. Yes we can proceed
07/10/23, 7:55 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
07/10/23, 7:55 am - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
07/10/23, 7:55 am - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
07/10/23, 7:55 am - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
07/10/23, 8:00 am - +263 77 350 6654: Understood
07/10/23, 8:04 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
07/10/23, 8:06 am - +263 77 350 6654: Correct
07/10/23, 8:06 am - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
07/10/23, 8:07 am - +263 77 350 6654: True,  I agree
07/10/23, 8:08 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
07/10/23, 8:08 am - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
07/10/23, 8:10 am - +263 77 350 6654: Noted thank you
07/10/23, 8:16 am - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
07/10/23, 8:16 am - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
07/10/23, 8:19 am - +263 77 350 6654: It's clear. However, I have a question.
How long does the diploma take to complete
07/10/23, 8:20 am - Kirti Edoofa: Surely let me help you understand diploma is a 3-year long course.
07/10/23, 8:20 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
07/10/23, 8:20 am - +263 77 350 6654: Okay thank you
07/10/23, 8:22 am - +263 77 350 6654: Thank you for explaining everything. It is our hope as Tanaka's parents that we do not reach to option 3
07/10/23, 8:23 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure Tanaka is going to get great grades and make you proud. Now Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
07/10/23, 8:24 am - +263 77 350 6654: No questions for now
07/10/23, 8:25 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As Tanaka's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Tanka is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
07/10/23, 8:27 am - +263 77 350 6654: Very much excited, ma'am.
07/10/23, 8:28 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.

May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from Gulzar Group of Institutes by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
14/10/23, 12:50 pm - +263 77 350 6654: I have been at a funeral, hence out of reach. I am yet to go through the offer letter. However, I  am very grateful to you all, Edoofa team, for your support
14/10/23, 12:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Oh, I am sorry to hear that dear, if I may ask who is it that we have lost?
14/10/23, 12:55 pm - +263 77 350 6654: Our neighbor and former student. She was murdered by her former husband. We are coming from the graveside for burial
14/10/23, 12:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am sorry to hear about that dear. May god provide peace to hear soul. Moving ahead, may I know if you are comfortable in continuing with the discussion now please?
14/10/23, 4:28 pm - +263 77 350 6654: Tanaka and not Ruvarashe
14/10/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 350 6654: We have a power cut so network is a challenge. However we can proceed
15/10/23, 10:34 pm - +27 74 691 1637 started a call
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Tanaka!
I hope you are doing well today.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm sorry for going offline during our conversation earlier. I wasn't feeling well with a fever and had to take medicine. I'm back now and ready to continue with our conversation.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, may I know if we can move ahead with our discussion regarding the same now please?
15/10/23, 9:53 pm - +263 77 350 6654: Good evening!! Hopefully, you are better now. Yes we can proceed
15/10/23, 10:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please I am better, thank you ☺️
15/10/23, 10:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, moving ahead, may I know if you were able to go through the offer letter by now?
15/10/23, 10:02 pm - +263 77 350 6654: Yes, I did go through it
15/10/23, 10:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from the Gulzar Group of Institutes, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/10/23, 10:21 pm - +263 77 350 6654: 1. 1225USD.         2.1200USD.          3. 750USD
15/10/23, 10:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter from GGI, after the scholarship your per-annum tuition fee is $1225.
15/10/23, 10:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: For the first year, it's mandatory for students to opt for the on-campus hostel as their FRRO has to be done by the university, however, from the second year, if they wish, they can opt to get off-campus accommodation as by then they would also be familiar with the place and would have made a few friends.

Gulzar Group of Institutes considers safety as one of the most important priorities and for the students to have an affordable and comfortable stay at hostels, the universities have two types of rooms, and students can choose the one as per their preference. Let me brief you on the two categories of accommodation as well -
15/10/23, 10:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. Three Seater with Mess - The per annum fee for a three-seater (three people staying together) hostel is $1250, the rooms are Air Conditioned and the food service is included in the fee as well. If you opt for a three-seater room, in this case, your per annum educational fee is ($1225 + $1250) = $2475.

2. Four Seater with Mess - The per annum fee for a Four -seater (four people staying together) hostel is $1000, the rooms are Air Conditioned and the food service is included in the fee as well. If you opt for a four-seater room, in this case, your per annum educational fee is ($1225 + $1000) = $2225.
15/10/23, 10:27 pm - +263 77 350 6654: OK. Am following
15/10/23, 10:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm glad you understand. Given the fact that there are two options for accommodation at Gulzar Group of Institutes, which category would you like to choose for yourself?
15/10/23, 10:33 pm - +263 77 350 6654: We choose option 2
15/10/23, 10:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: You can surely opt for that option. I also want to inform you that one can easily upgrade or downgrade their accommodation after coming to India, the option will stay open for them.
15/10/23, 10:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: In this case, as you want to opt for four-seater accommodation, your per annum fee is $2225 which can be paid in two parts of $1112 & $1113 at a gap of 6 months and can be reduced with the help of the EWYL Program as well as much you want.
15/10/23, 10:37 pm - +263 77 350 6654: Noted
15/10/23, 10:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: This per annum fee includes your tuition fee, library fee, living expenses, food cost, and other basic amenities such as 24-hour wifi cost, water, and electricity bills. Are you clear on this?
15/10/23, 10:41 pm - +263 77 350 6654: Yes, I am clear on that on
15/10/23, 10:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
15/10/23, 10:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
15/10/23, 10:48 pm - +263 77 350 6654: It's clear and I am following
15/10/23, 10:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2225 and so the balance fee becomes $2225 - $1000 = $1225 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure.
15/10/23, 10:52 pm - +263 77 350 6654: Very true, it helps indeed
15/10/23, 10:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.
15/10/23, 10:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: At the same time, let us move forward to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter as well - 

As informed, for the first year, the registration fee of $750 will be adjusted against your first year fee of $2225, therefore the amount of fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $2225 - $750= $1475, and that can be paid in two parts of $737 & $738 at a gap of 6 months (August 2024/January 2025). 

Are we on the same page here as well? <This message was edited>
15/10/23, 10:57 pm - +263 77 350 6654: Noted, but is the $750 a once off payment?
15/10/23, 11:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
15/10/23, 11:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
15/10/23, 11:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
15/10/23, 11:05 pm - +263 77 350 6654: We would opt for this method, but I thought 15 working days from 11 October would get us to 31 October. Correct me if I am wrong
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tanaka!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please. However, since the deadlines are calculated from the day you receive the offer letter, that is why the deadline is of 28th October please. Moving ahead, may I know if you have any challenge in completing the registration process with these set of deadlines>
16/10/23, 1:29 pm - +263 77 350 6654: Will come back to you soon after discussing as the family
16/10/23, 2:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Sure you can do that. Before you do that, may I know if we can move ahead to complete our discussion about the offer letter here?
16/10/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 350 6654: Yes we can proceed
16/10/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 350 6654: We have no electricity so network may not be stable
16/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
16/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
16/10/23, 5:59 pm - +263 77 350 6654: We stay in Murambinda very far from Harare but close to Mutare
17/10/23, 1:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tanaka!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 1:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
17/10/23, 1:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
17/10/23, 1:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
17/10/23, 1:14 pm - +263 77 350 6654: Thank you. However we have a challenge we can only get the money  on 1 November after receiving our salaries.
17/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. On that note, as you can see that the university has given you the date of 28th October to complete the registration process, then how is it that you are planning to do that?
17/10/23, 5:01 pm - +263 77 350 6654: We will try to run around
18/10/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 350 6654: Got in touch with him. Thank you
18/10/23, 2:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
18/10/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 350 6654: Yes, you can send them, and we will see which method will be usable on the day of deposit
18/10/23, 2:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, if making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

19/10/23, 10:33 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tanaka!

Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require.

19/10/23, 11:10 am - +263 77 350 6654: We can proceed

I'm here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
19/10/23, 11:16 am - +263 77 350 6654: Due to the heavy rains that we received, our network is poor, so we could not access the internet to check
19/10/23, 11:18 am - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please, moving ahead, I would advise you to research about the same and then let me know if you have any queries or concerns regarding that, I hope this is clear?
19/10/23, 12:23 pm - +263 77 350 6654: Noted
19/10/23, 12:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, since the university has given you a date of 28th October to complete the registration process, you have two options to do that, one is a $300 payment, and the other is a single payment of $600. Have you had a chance to consider which payment plan you'd like to proceed with?
19/10/23, 12:41 pm - +263 77 350 6654: We have considered the $300  payment
19/10/23, 12:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of this. In addition, it would be great if you could kindly provide me with the specific date you have in mind for the payment and the mode of payment that you are planning to use so that I can share the same information with the university officials as well.
19/10/23, 12:47 pm - +263 77 350 6654: Honestly speaking, we don't have a date at the moment. We are still running around with the hope of getting something before the 28th
19/10/23, 12:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. In that case, I would advise you to make the necessary preparation in a timely manner, and if any challenges rise, please let me know before time so that we can plan things out.
