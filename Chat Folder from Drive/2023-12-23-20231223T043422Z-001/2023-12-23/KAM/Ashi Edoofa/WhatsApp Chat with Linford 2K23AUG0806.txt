So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
22/08/23, 8:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.
22/08/23, 8:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
22/08/23, 8:04 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Yes he discussed the same with me
22/08/23, 8:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
22/08/23, 8:10 pm - +263 78 041 2990: this is understood
22/08/23, 8:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
22/08/23, 8:11 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Alright its clear
22/08/23, 8:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months.
22/08/23, 8:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
22/08/23, 8:46 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Yes im following
22/08/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be?
22/08/23, 9:03 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Haaa no l don't have any queries l did understand very well as you well explaining
22/08/23, 9:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. Now, I have exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs. Furthermore, your Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program is scheduled to begin alongside our ongoing session. So, I am now sharing you with the EWYL details first.
22/08/23, 9:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have taken a step forward for your dream of education abroad and are working hard to prepare for your higher educational finances, we would be helping you initiate your EWYL Program so that you can utilize the next few months wisely and prepare for your journey to India.

To commence your EWYL Program, your dedicated mentor has created a group with the name *Linford EWYL23E0546*. You along with your parents/guardian/sponsor will have to join your group using the below link.

Group Link: https://chat.whatsapp.com/CVtsS2hWWIaBI2Y9hFJqDO"
22/08/23, 9:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you and your parents have joined the group. please send the following message to the group - *Dear Mentor, my name is Linford Mukiriwani and my EWYL group name is Linford EWYL23E0546.* I have completed my counseling session with the admissions team and now I am ready to start with my EWYL journey as well.
22/08/23, 9:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: "Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

Hello Admission officer, I have started my EWYL journey and my mentor is Mr./Ms. __"
22/08/23, 9:06 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Yah i'm eager to know about it
22/08/23, 9:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now dear, let's delve into the eagerly awaited announcement. We have some fantastic news for students like you who are currently navigating the admission process. This unique opportunity is time-sensitive and brings with it significant advantages for those who opt to finalize their admission ahead of schedule, specifically before your *A-Level/Grade-12* results are released. This can be achieved with the assistance of your statement of entry.

By making this early decision, you can position yourself to reap benefits that can reduce your cost of Higher Education. I hope we are on the same page here?
22/08/23, 9:11 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Yes we are
22/08/23, 9:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's wonderful to hear! I've reviewed the session you had with your counselor, and it's heartening to see the unwavering support your family is providing to help realize your dream of higher education.

While the pursuit of education is a significant achievement, it's important to recognize that it's not the sole responsibility your family bears. They have various other commitments and obligations, and over time, they might encounter certain challenges that they'll strive to manage without burdening you.
22/08/23, 9:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, on behalf of your application, I want to emphasize that we're committed to assisting you not only during the enrollment process but also in managing your finances for university admission. Just as we facilitated your enrollment fee payments in installments, we're here to extend similar support for the admission process.

Speaking of which, there's an exciting Early Decision Benefit available for applicants for the 2024 intake. It's designed to provide advantageous terms for those who choose to make an early commitment to their admission process. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
22/08/23, 9:20 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Well l haven't heard about it yet
22/08/23, 9:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *I understand Linford, it is alright. So, basically under this program, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.*

For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
 
As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
22/08/23, 9:23 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Yah it would
22/08/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, indeed. So, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
22/08/23, 9:32 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Yes you can tell me more about it
22/08/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
22/08/23, 9:35 pm - +263 78 041 2990: No l wasn't
22/08/23, 9:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:
22/08/23, 9:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. Get Early Access to Scholarship Seats in the Top Indian Universities with Edoofa.

2. Get an opportunity to keep your university fee structure as of the current batch of admissions.

3. Get an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. No Financial Pressure of making the payment in one go, there is an option of making the payment of the registration fee in 2 parts over a period of 30-45 days.

And for the student, who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, they get the following 2 benefits as well if they choose to get the early decision benefits:

5. If a student fails to bring in a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, an option to change the course to a Diploma Program will be given so that the student doesn't lose a year.

6. If a student fails to bring in a minimum of 2 passes in the A-level Examination, and neither wants to start a diploma course, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job oriented projects.

*The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program.*

Are you clear on these benefits?
22/08/23, 9:44 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Yah l am
22/08/23, 9:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would like to let you know that I will be concluding our session for now as I have an important meeting coming up, dear. So I shall connect with you tomorrow at 7:30 PM have a great night, dear.
22/08/23, 9:46 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Yah7.30pm is fine with me
22/08/23, 9:46 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Thank you for your time and good night
23/08/23, 5:34 pm - +263 78 041 2990: *Hello Admission Officer,l have started my EWYL journey and my mentor is Ms Aditi Kapoor*
23/08/23, 7:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Dear Parents and Linford, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that positive note I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

Shall we begin?
23/08/23, 7:43 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Good evening as well
23/08/23, 7:43 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Yes we can begin
23/08/23, 7:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:

1. Since you are yet to get your A-Level results, but when you connect with the universities for your admission process now, it makes you an early applicant. Here, you will be given a provisional letter of intent from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned after you complete your registration formalities when your result comes, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point.
23/08/23, 8:15 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Yes its clear
23/08/23, 8:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. That is wonderful to hear, dear. Each year the universities revise their fee structure and it is highly possible that the fee would be increased for the academic year 2024. Over the past few years, we have seen a hike of 20%-30% in the tuition fee and to help our students from the same, students have been given the opportunity to keep their fee structure as per the current academic year of 2023.

Here, if you make the early decision to start with your university admission process and decide to reserve your seat with the university earlier, you will be able to get the above-mentioned early decision benefit and this would help you keep your fee structure the same for the complete course of your bachelor’s education in India.
23/08/23, 8:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even if the fee increases for your admission intake which is 2024, you would be protected against that and your fee will be in accordance with 2023. Are we on the same page here?
23/08/23, 8:27 pm - +263 78 041 2990: We are on the same page
23/08/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I am glad to hear that. Here, when you receive the Letter of Intent (Offer Letter) from the university, the registration fee would be mentioned, so by the grant of $150 means, if your registration fee is $750, then the actual registration fee that you have to pay will be only $600. 

Once the payment of $600 is made by you, the complete amount of $750 will be adjusted against your first-year university fee since we will be paying the $150 to the university on your behalf. Have you understood?
23/08/23, 8:54 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Yes I have understood
23/08/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I am pleased to hear that. If your finances aren't prepared, and you need some time, in such cases, *Edoofa* is giving the option to make the payment of the Registration fee in 2 parts, the first part i.e. 50% of the registration fee after the grant of $150, has to be paid within the time period mentioned by the university and the second part i.e. the remaining 50% of the registration fee has to be paid within 30 days from the first deadline date. 

For example, if your deadline is 1st September 2023, and your registration fee after the grant is $600, then you have to pay $300 on or before 1st September 2023, and the remaining $300 has to be paid by 1st Octtober 2024. Any queries so far?
23/08/23, 9:00 pm - +263 78 041 2990: No,im following
23/08/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 5. That is great to know. Now, when your A-Level Results come and if you fail to bring a minimum of 2 passes, then it means, you cannot get admission for bachelor's courses anywhere around the world.

But, here at Edoofa, we all understand that due to several reasons such as poor teaching practices, the absence of better learning resources, and also the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the students have not been able to give their best and adjust to the new methods of learning, so keeping the same in mind and to ensure the best for our students, we will get the students admitted to a Diploma course so that the student doesn't waste a year and have a break in higher education. Isn’t it a good solution?
23/08/23, 9:03 pm - +263 78 041 2990: It is actually a good solution
23/08/23, 9:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 6. Glad to know that. Here, it might happen that if you failed to bring 2 passes in your A-Level, you may not wish to pursue a diploma course, nor you may want to re-write your A-Level Exams or join a Bachelor's program.

So, this basically means that you want to put your Academic Career to a halt. In such cases, you will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects. Along with that, you will also be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program.
23/08/23, 9:16 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Okay I understand
23/08/23, 9:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through all 6 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 6 points clear?
23/08/23, 9:21 pm - +263 78 041 2990: I have gone through all the 6 points and they are clear and straightforward as well. We can proceed
23/08/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright, I’m glad to know that you have understood all of this well! Now, I would like you to take some time and have a discussion with your parents concerning the next steps in your university admission journey and update them about the benefits of the early decision. I am sure they would be excited and open to the same opportunity. And we can connect tomorrow at 12:30 PM. I hope this timing works for you, dear?
23/08/23, 9:29 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Yes I2.30pm is fine with me and l will discuss with them about this
23/08/23, 9:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, dear. Have a great night and my warm regards you to your family as well.
23/08/23, 9:33 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Thank you very much,have a good night as well
24/08/23, 12:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Dear Parents and Linford, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that positive note I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

Shall we begin?
24/08/23, 1:02 pm - +263 78 041 2990: good afternoon
24/08/23, 1:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: How are you doing today, dear?
24/08/23, 1:07 pm - +263 78 041 2990: I'm doing very well
24/08/23, 1:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm pleased to learn that. Linford, I'm interested in knowing whether you've had the opportunity to engage in a conversation regarding the advantages of early decisions, as we touched upon yesterday.
24/08/23, 1:16 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Yah l have
24/08/23, 1:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I would be pleased if you let me know how was the discussion on the Early Decision Benefits and what was your thoughts by your parents?
24/08/23, 5:38 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Good evening
24/08/23, 5:39 pm - +263 78 041 2990: The discussion went well and they were elighted about that idea
24/08/23, 7:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know, dear. Kindly excuse me for the late reply, I was occupied with a meeting. Now, Before we move forward and have a conversation regarding the same, may I know if your parents are active and have any queries that you would like to ask or any concerns that have been bothering you and you would like to share?
24/08/23, 7:37 pm - +263 78 041 2990: yeah they are active
24/08/23, 7:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great! It is good to know all of us are on the same page. I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.
24/08/23, 7:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due will be mentioned. <This message was edited>
24/08/23, 7:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?
24/08/23, 7:53 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Yes we are on the same page
24/08/23, 7:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, dear. I would also like you to understand the importance of the deadlines given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes if one misses the same.
24/08/23, 7:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university, If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and they cannot take admission into that particular university for the current academic year, the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
24/08/23, 7:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
24/08/23, 8:00 pm - +263 77 307 7682: Evening, as parents we are moving together, with you and we are on the same page, so you can go ahead with  the Admission process  we are prepared  .
24/08/23, 8:05 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Yes
24/08/23, 8:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great. Now you have two ways to proceed with your child’s university admission process -

1. Proceed as per the standard procedures
2. Proceed with the Early Decision Benefits
24/08/23, 8:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Be assured that I would help you understand the difference between both of them so that you can make a well-informed decision regarding your child’s university admission process. Shall we start with our discussion regarding the same?
24/08/23, 8:11 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Yes we can
24/08/23, 8:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is amazing to hear, Lisford. Let us start with the *Standard Registration/University Admission process*-

As you are aware that one’s registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university, to be on the safer side, let us assume that the registration fee is $750 itself.

As per the standard procedures, once you get the offer letter from the university, you would be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of $750.

For example, if you get the offer letter on the 5th of September and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, the deadline for the registration fee would be the 20th of September 2023 and you would have to make the payment of the fee before then. May I know if we are on the same page here as well?
24/08/23, 8:17 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Yes thus right
24/08/23, 8:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great, now let us discuss the *Early Registration/University Admission process -*

As the name states, a student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.

If you do that, you are eligible for all 6 benefits that we discussed earlier. Since benefit number 3 and 4 helps you ease the registration process, I will be discussing the same in particular and help you understand how that happens -
24/08/23, 8:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: When we talk about the Early Decision Grant of $150 (benefit number 3) 

To understand the same, let us once again assume that the registration fee due is $750 and if you have a grant of $150, this means that out of the fee due of $750, $150 will be paid by the Edoofa Academic Board on your behalf and hence this leaves your child’s fee due as $750 - $150 = $600.

So, the amount that you will have to pay to reserve/lock your child’s scholarship seat becomes $600.
24/08/23, 8:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

1. The first part ~ $300 is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 05th of September, the deadline becomes the 20th of September, 2023)

2. The second part ~ $300 is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 05th of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 20th of September 2023, making the second deadline be the 20th of October, 2023).
24/08/23, 8:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know if we are on the same page here as well.
24/08/23, 8:21 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Yes we are on the same page
24/08/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
24/08/23, 8:26 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Yes they are
24/08/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, now before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
24/08/23, 8:46 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Alright my admission process will begin after I've been accepted in the University and that's when I will have to pay the registration amount stated by the University. The two ways in which we can proceed with is the Standard Registration procedure where we have to pay the stated amount in one full installment and that amount will have to be paid within 15 days. The Second  way is the Early days Registration Admission Process where a student is given a $150 grant and will have to pay the other amount eg 600 in two installments. The registration fee is $750
24/08/23, 8:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days. 

4. With the standard admission process, as a student you are not paying any more amount of fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until your parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with your admission process..

Are you clear on this?
24/08/23, 8:51 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Yes this is clear
24/08/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
24/08/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Wednesday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.

When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $70 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *20th September* and *20th October*.
24/08/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, If you as parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines (*20th September* and *20th October*), you can give us the go-ahead so that we can prepare Linford's application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
24/08/23, 9:15 pm - +263 77 307 7682: Well as a parent l give you the go-ahead to prepare the application for the scholarship and share it with the universities
24/08/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, as you have given us the go-ahead, let us proceed towards preparing Linford's application and forward it to the universities, applicable for the course and suggested by the academic board. Once we get an update from the universities, we will reconnect with you and share the same updates with you. 

In the meantime, if and when you have any queries, feel free to bring them forward so that we can address them and help you plan for Linford's higher education well.
24/08/23, 9:23 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Alright
24/08/23, 9:23 pm - +263 77 307 7682: Thankyou! Noted
24/08/23, 9:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. I would like you to conclude our session here for now and we shall update you when we have further updates from the universities. Have a great night and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
24/08/23, 9:30 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Good night
30/08/23, 8:10 pm - +263 78 041 2990: good evening
31/08/23, 3:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Linford. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. How may I help you today?
01/09/23, 8:17 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Linford!
I hope you all are doing well. 

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa, and today, I have some incredible news to share with you all! After you gave the admissions team the green light to proceed with your university application process, the team worked on processing your application accordingly. And, I'm thrilled to inform you that the university application process has been a success and you have received a prestigious offer from MVN University, along with a remarkable 100% scholarship! Congratulations on this incredible achievement. 🌟✨
01/09/23, 8:17 am - Milan Edoofa: The University will be mailing you the letter shortly, since we received the letter early, we are sharing it with you here. Take your time to review the letter and then once you are done going through it, we will then have a discussion about the letter in detail and address any questions or concerns you may have. Congratulations on this prestigious offer and securing a 100% scholarship! Your hard work has truly paid off! ⭐🌟
01/09/23, 8:17 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/09/23, 9:36 am - +263 78 041 2990: Ohhhh wow thank you very much for this big news. Im very much thrilled by this .
01/09/23, 9:36 am - +263 78 041 2990: Thank you as well for doing your best in processing the university application
01/09/23, 2:22 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Yah exactly
01/09/23, 2:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as you can see in your offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $0
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
01/09/23, 2:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you would be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1250.

Now, for the first year, you can see that there are two components that are one-time payable i.e. Sports Fee and Misc. Fee, so your total expenses for the first year become $1250 + $250 = $1500.

Please note that this cost is only for the first year, and from the second year onwards, your per annum cost of education will be $1250. I hope you are clear about that?
01/09/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Yes l am
01/09/23, 2:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, now as you are aware of your per annum fee, let me tell you what all facilities are offered by the universities and are covered as per the university's fee structure -

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Exmanitaion Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank 
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.

I hope you are clear with this?
01/09/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Ohhh yeah its clear also
01/09/23, 2:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, students under the Edoofa Program have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
01/09/23, 2:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
01/09/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Yah I have a clear understanding about the EWYL
01/09/23, 3:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum education costs of $1250 and so the balance fee becomes $1250 - $1000 = $250 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
01/09/23, 3:28 pm - +263 78 041 2990: yes its much affordable with the help of these scholarship credits
02/09/23, 8:43 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Linford!
I hope you are doing well today.
02/09/23, 8:44 am - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier since I got occupied in an urgent meeting that came up unplanned. Now, I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
02/09/23, 8:44 am - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, as informed, the admission and processing fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter will be adjusted against your first year’s expenses of $1500, therefore the amount of fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $1500 - $1000 = $500.

I hope you are clear about this as well? <This message was edited>
02/09/23, 9:12 am - +263 78 041 2990: good morning yeah we are all doing well
02/09/23, 9:12 am - +263 78 041 2990: Yes sure
02/09/23, 9:13 am - +263 78 041 2990: Yeah im clear about that one
02/09/23, 9:15 am - +263 78 041 2990: My parents wanted to ask about the payment of that $1000. They wanted to know if this amount can be paid in two installements like you said earlier during our discussion of Early Payment method or its just one installment
02/09/23, 9:44 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please Linford we are coming to discuss that dear. Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the admission fee of $1000 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
02/09/23, 9:44 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, we understand that in addition to the 90-100% scholarship opportunity, the admission fee of $1000 can be challenging for some parents. To make it more affordable, we are offering a payment plan for the same. Along with that since you also have the EDB Grant of $150, hence, you would have to make the payment of the admission fee after the grant, i.e. $850 in two equal parts as:

1. $425 before 15th September 2023.
2. $425 before 15th October 2023.
02/09/23, 9:44 am - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $1000  within 15 days by 15th September 2023. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
02/09/23, 11:29 am - +263 78 041 2990: Alright l think l can with my parents that this payment plan is better for us
02/09/23, 11:30 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due. The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
02/09/23, 11:30 am - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
02/09/23, 11:32 am - +263 78 041 2990: Yah Chitungwiza Harare
02/09/23, 11:32 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you are planning to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
02/09/23, 11:33 am - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
02/09/23, 11:33 am - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
02/09/23, 12:09 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Alright we will contact him
02/09/23, 12:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
02/09/23, 12:54 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Yah you can
02/09/23, 12:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
02/09/23, 12:58 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Alright we will use this account like we did the other time
02/09/23, 12:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
02/09/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Alright as l was going through the document l noticed the dates which were mentioned
Tentative start and end dates: 1st week August 2023-ist week June 2026
02/09/23, 1:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, regarding this query of yours, I would like to mention that the dates that are mentioned on the offer letter are tentative dates for the start of this year's intake, which means that the intake would not start exactly at that time. 

On the same note, I would like to mention that MVN University has already released their date of travel and that is in the month of September, specifically within the second-third week. I hope this is clear with you?
02/09/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Okay that's clear
02/09/23, 7:23 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Good evening
04/09/23, 8:53 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Linford!
I hope you are doing well today.
04/09/23, 8:53 am - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
04/09/23, 8:54 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we can move ahead with our discussion.
04/09/23, 8:59 am - +263 78 041 2990: Good morning to you as well
04/09/23, 8:59 am - +263 78 041 2990: Alright that's fine
04/09/23, 9:02 am - +263 78 041 2990: well not any l can think of at the moment. The only query l had was about the tantative dates and you explained to me. So we can move forward

I'd like to inform you that your recent payment of $473 towards the first part of your registration fee has been successfully confirmed by our accounts team.

I trust this message finds you in good health. I am Ms. Ashi, the Admission Officer at Edoofa. I am pleased to inform you that the payment of your registration fee has been confirmed by the accounts team and we have updated the university officials on the same.

As per the updates we have from the admissions team, they are hopeful to get updates from Lovely Professional University as well for your application, we are waiting for the same so that you have another scholarship offer and you can make a well-informed decision for your higher education and then the university will process your provisional admission acceptance letter.
23/11/23, 6:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Additionally , Since your admission intake is for August 2024, you will be working on the visa requirements for now and towards the month of April 2024 when the universities release the tentative arrival dates for the upcoming batch. That is when you will be visiting the embassy to submit your documents and process your visa application further. I hope you are clear on this?

22/12/23, 7:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In light of your admission process, As we have shared that one of our partnered universities, Lovely Professional University (LPU), which is among the top 100 universities in India, has been considering your application for the scholarship opportunity. They have mentioned that they would be able to give us an update by the month of January, considering the high volume of applications they have received in the past two months (more than 2000 applications).
22/12/23, 7:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In addition to this, the academic board also mentioned that there are a few more universities willing to put your application in consideration for scholarship opportunities in the month of January. Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter. This approach allows you to have multiple scholarship options, giving you the flexibility to decide on the university for your education in India and then carry out your visa application process the right way.
22/12/23, 7:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this update, I also want to inform you that since we are waiting for updates from the universities, we will be holding our conversation until 20th January and will reconnect around the same time. Until then, we wanted to share these updates with you so that you are well-informed about the process and know what lies ahead. We are thrilled to be a part of this new chapter in your academic journey.
22/12/23, 7:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, now that you are done with your admission process, you are encouraged to channel your energy and focus on your Earn While You Learn (EWYL) journey so that you can maximize the benefits from it. May this period be filled with meaningful learning, personal growth, and amazing opportunities.
