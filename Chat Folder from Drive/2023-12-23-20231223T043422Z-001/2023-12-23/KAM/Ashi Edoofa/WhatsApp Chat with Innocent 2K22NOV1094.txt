07/09/23, 8:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for sharing the documents with me, it is well noted by the admission team. We are ready and excited to commence your academic journey for the year 2024. 

To proceed with our discussion, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure. I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure.
07/09/23, 8:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/09/23, 8:30 pm - +263 77 371 3750: Thanks  still remember
07/09/23, 9:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me? <This message was edited>
07/09/23, 9:49 pm - +263 77 371 3750: The 4th stage is where we receive offer letter from college or university the child is going with the percentage schoolaship and what is expected from the students or in short dose and don't at the institution
07/09/23, 9:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
07/09/23, 10:07 pm - +263 77 371 3750: Sorry sir may you share with us as parents the opportunity of finaling Admission is September
07/09/23, 10:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tt is alright, let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.
07/09/23, 10:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
 
As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
07/09/23, 10:21 pm - +263 77 371 3750: Thank you sir well understood
07/09/23, 10:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it has been a long day for me, and our available hours are coming to an end, I would like to reconnect tomorrow and continue with our session. I hope you have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
07/09/23, 10:24 pm - +263 77 371 3750: Some to you Thanks

09/09/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 714 8442: Its ok sir no problem,same to you wish you a fantastic weekend
13/09/23, 1:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon. I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further, as it was a long weekend and I was occupied with unforeseen work. 

Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
13/09/23, 1:24 pm - +263 77 714 8442: Afternoon sir, yes we are available we can proceed
13/09/23, 1:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing to hear that, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
13/09/23, 1:30 pm - +263 77 371 3750: Yes. Shade more light onearly Decision benefits as. well $150 grant
13/09/23, 1:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
13/09/23, 1:49 pm - +263 77 371 3750: No was not aware
13/09/23, 1:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:

1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.

3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
13/09/23, 1:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, choosing the early decision benefits brings two additional advantages:

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.

*The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program*
13/09/23, 1:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through these benefits so that we can discuss all of them one by one.
13/09/23, 1:57 pm - +263 77 714 8442: We have gone through  ,let's discuss them
13/09/23, 2:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. As you await your A-Level results, initiating the university admission process now positions you as an early applicant. This status comes with the advantage of receiving a provisional letter of intent from the university. This letter will outline your scholarship percentage and associated fees. Once you complete your registration formalities and your results are available, you'll be provided with your Official Admission Letter. This letter will enable you to proceed with your student visa application. I trust this point is now clear to you.
13/09/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 371 3750: Thus fine let's continue with university Admission process
13/09/23, 2:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
13/09/23, 2:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Students now have the reamrkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This can be achieved by making an early decision to initiate the university admission process and securing your seat in advance. By taking this step, you can avail the early decision benefits previously mentioned. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
13/09/23, 2:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
13/09/23, 2:17 pm - +263 77 371 3750: Fine l would like to initiate the university process now to secure a seat. What steps should a follow to achieve that
13/09/23, 2:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We will come to that soon, dear. I would first like us to go through the discussion so that we would have a better understanding.
13/09/23, 2:58 pm - +263 77 714 8442: Ok sir let's procced with the discussion
13/09/23, 3:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
13/09/23, 3:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be skillfully adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
13/09/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 371 3750: Well understood
13/09/23, 3:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, we're offering the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
13/09/23, 3:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
13/09/23, 3:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 17, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 17, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 17, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
13/09/23, 3:39 pm - +263 77 714 8442: Ok understood
13/09/23, 3:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
13/09/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 714 8442: May you  provide us with more information sir
13/09/23, 4:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student decides to initiate their admission process before receiving their A-Level results, they gain the advantage of early registration benefits. At this stage, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from entities like Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship percentage as promised.
13/09/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 371 3750: Ok
13/09/23, 4:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there might be a scenario where the student might not achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels. 

In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship. However, if a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university with early decision benefits, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged.
13/09/23, 4:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On the other hand, if a student manages to achieve a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application once the results are available. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how this gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process as per the standard procedures?
13/09/23, 4:19 pm - +263 77 371 3750: Sorry I'm not getting paragraph 1&2 may you explain what it mean
13/09/23, 4:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue a Bachelor's degree with a scholarship, students need to maintain two E grades, equivalent to two passes. If a student doesn't achieve at least 6 points in their A-Levels, they won't qualify for a 50% scholarship, unless they secure a scholarship seat through early decision benefits, in which case their scholarship remains at 50%. If a student achieves a better result, the university will reassess their application and potentially increase their scholarship. This approach gives an advantage to students who secure early admission, as their scholarship percentage remains fixed, whereas others have their scholarships reevaluated based on their final results, potentially leading to higher scholarships.
13/09/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 371 3750: Sharp
13/09/23, 4:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are clear now?
13/09/23, 4:27 pm - +263 77 371 3750: Clear
13/09/23, 4:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
13/09/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 371 3750: True
13/09/23, 4:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
13/09/23, 5:26 pm - +263 77 371 3750: 1&2 sounds fine
13/09/23, 7:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, Kindly excuse me for the late reply, our available hours for the first slot have just ended.
13/09/23, 7:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
13/09/23, 7:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the early decision benefits, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for  another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
13/09/23, 8:08 pm - +263 77 714 8442: Clear
13/09/23, 8:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
13/09/23, 8:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
13/09/23, 8:28 pm - +263 71 914 8442: Yes thats clear
13/09/23, 9:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
13/09/23, 9:16 pm - +263 77 714 8442: Understood
13/09/23, 9:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through all 7 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 7 points clear?
13/09/23, 9:38 pm - +263 77 714 8442: Very clear sir
13/09/23, 9:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright, I’m glad to know that you have understood all of this well! Now, I would like you to take some time and have a discussion with your family concerning the next steps in your university admission journey and update them about the benefits of the early decision. I am sure they would be excited and open to the same opportunity. Hence, I shall conclude our session for now and we shall connect tomorrow at 7:30 PM for further continuation of our session.
13/09/23, 9:43 pm - +263 77 714 8442: Ok sir good night
14/09/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and lnnocent. How are you doing this lovely evening?
14/09/23, 8:35 pm - +263 77 714 8442: Good evening sir ,we are doing very well
14/09/23, 8:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm pleased to learn that. I'm interested in knowing whether you've had the opportunity to engage in a conversation regarding the advantages of early decisions with your family, as we touched upon the previous day.
14/09/23, 8:55 pm - +263 77 371 3750: Sure we discussed
14/09/23, 8:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I would be pleased if you let me know how was the discussion on the Early Decision Benefits and what was your thoughts?
14/09/23, 9:09 pm - +263 77 371 3750: They are all straight forward
14/09/23, 9:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear, dear. Now before we move forward and have a conversation regarding the same, may I know if your parents have any queries that you would like to ask or any concerns that have been bothering you and you would like to share?
14/09/23, 9:36 pm - +263 77 371 3750: Sorry sir you are talking to the parents Innocent is. At school he is not allowed cellphone while at school Thank you
14/09/23, 9:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know Mr. Mafaranga. May I know if you have any queried or concerns that you would like to share?
14/09/23, 9:41 pm - +263 77 371 3750: So far so good
18/09/23, 4:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

*1. The first part ~ $300* is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 22nd of September, the deadline becomes the 7th of October, 2023)

*2. The second part ~ $300* is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 22nd of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 7th of October 2023, making the second deadline the 7th of November, 2023).

Please let me know if we are on the same page here as well?
18/09/23, 4:35 pm - +263 77 371 3750: This is better now if possible we get the offer letter around 10th October 2023 I will  beat the deadline
18/09/23, 4:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. However, the offer letter might be arriving within a timeframe of 7 days. May I know if we are on the same page?
18/09/23, 4:42 pm - +263 77 371 3750: Around 25/09/2023. Add 15days = 10/10/2023 around that. I'm correct?
18/09/23, 4:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is absolutely correct.
18/09/23, 4:49 pm - +263 77 371 3750: So it works let's proceed
18/09/23, 4:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
18/09/23, 4:52 pm - +263 77 371 3750: Very clear sir
18/09/23, 4:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, now before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
18/09/23, 5:01 pm - +263 77 371 3750: 1 standard fees in 15days 
 2. After offer letter I have 15days to. Half the registration fees and balance within 30days from the first deadline
18/09/23, 5:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days.
18/09/23, 5:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. With the standard admission process, as a student you are not paying any more amount of fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until your parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with your admission process.

Please let me know if you are clear on this?
18/09/23, 5:39 pm - +263 77 371 3750: Very clear let's proceed
18/09/23, 5:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
18/09/23, 5:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Monday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.

When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *7th October* and *7th November*.
18/09/23, 5:58 pm - +263 77 371 3750: Let's proceed
18/09/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now that you have given us the go-ahead to move forward with Name’s university admission process, I believe you are financially confident that you will be able to manage the registration fee in due time by ( *7th October* and *7th November*.) and are mentally prepared for the next steps?
18/09/23, 6:10 pm - +263 77 371 3750: Very confident
18/09/23, 6:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, as you have given us the go-ahead, let us proceed towards preparing lnnocent’s application and forward it to the universities, applicable for the course and suggested by the academic board. Once we get an update from the universities, we will reconnect with you and share the same updates with you. In the meantime, if and when you have any queries, feel free to bring them forward so that we can address them and help you plan for lnnocent’s higher education well.
18/09/23, 6:15 pm - +263 77 714 8442: That's fine with pleasure may you proceed
03/10/23, 10:00 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Innocent!
I hope you all are doing well. 

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa, and today, I have some incredible news to share with you all!

Congratulations on this prestigious offer and securing a scholarship! Your hard work has truly paid off! ⭐🌟
03/10/23, 10:00 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/10/23, 10:46 am - +263 77 714 8442: Thank very much sir will discuss at 1 o'clock
03/10/23, 1:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Innocent!

May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
03/10/23, 1:32 pm - +263 77 714 8442: Afternoon sir ,yes we go through it and we are avaible
03/10/23, 1:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Galgotias University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
03/10/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 714 8442: 1. $900
2 .3 years (6 semesters)
3.$300
4.$750
03/10/23, 1:55 pm - +263 77 371 3750: 1800 before schoolaship
03/10/23, 1:57 pm - +263 77 371 3750: May you help us on $750.
03/10/23, 1:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please we are coming to discuss that. Now, As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a three-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 6 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
03/10/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 371 3750: Clear on this one
03/10/23, 2:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
03/10/23, 2:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
03/10/23, 2:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
03/10/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 371 3750: $800 accommodation per annum. Including cost of food and basic. living expenses how good. Is it
03/10/23, 2:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes.

Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students. I hope this clears the doubt that you have here, right?
03/10/23, 2:15 pm - +263 77 371 3750: Sharp
03/10/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 371 3750: Let's clear on 750
03/10/23, 2:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
03/10/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 714 8442: We are together sir
03/10/23, 2:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
03/10/23, 2:36 pm - +263 77 714 8442: Clear sir
03/10/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
03/10/23, 2:47 pm - +263 77 371 3750: Clear now thank  .How far is the university from town
03/10/23, 2:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great, I'm glad to hear that things are clear so far. Regarding the distance of Galgotias University from the town, it's situated in Greater Noida, a city in the National Capital Region (NCR) of India. I hope this is clear, right?
03/10/23, 3:04 pm - +263 77 714 8442: Ok sir clear
03/10/23, 3:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
03/10/23, 3:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 17th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 17th November 2023.*
03/10/23, 3:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *17th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
03/10/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 371 3750: Perfect
03/10/23, 3:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
03/10/23, 3:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
03/10/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 371 3750: I'm in kwekwe
03/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
03/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
03/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
04/10/23, 10:13 am - Milan Edoofa changed the group name from "lnnocent 2K22NOV1094" to "Innocent 2K22NOV1094"
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Innocent!
I hope you are doing well today.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your side earlier so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion regarding your offer letter from the university. May I know by when can we reconnect with each other here for the same?
05/10/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 371 3750: Afternoon sir everything is under control we connected  with Mr  Rajan I will deposit tomorrow
05/10/23, 4:27 pm - +263 77 371 3750: May you go ahead with processing the offer letter please
05/10/23, 4:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, you can surely do that, however, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
05/10/23, 4:41 pm - +263 77 371 3750: OK I phoned Mr Rajan 5minutes ago we have agreed that I will send him $400 2moro then the balance after 24hrs because maximum transaction per day local is around 420 so thus the challenge
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents Innocent!
I hope you are doing well today.
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. Now, on that note, since you had mentioned that you were going to make the payment today, hence, can you please share an update with me on the same that if you were able to make the payment by now?
