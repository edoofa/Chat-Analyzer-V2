09/09/23, 9:09 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Sikhanyisiwe!
I hope you are doing well today.
09/09/23, 9:09 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any queries you have. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
09/09/23, 7:09 pm - +263 77 876 0238: 1. 975 USD 
2. 3 years
3. 200 USD
4. 700 USD
09/09/23, 7:09 pm - +263 77 876 0238: We are doing well , i hope you good too. 
My apology for the late
 responses.
11/09/23, 2:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Sikhanyisiwe!
I hope you are doing well today.
11/09/23, 2:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 3-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 6 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $975 making your per annum tuition fee ($975*2) = $1950. Is that clear?
11/09/23, 3:11 pm - +27 63 440 0827: We are doing well,yes it's clear.
12/09/23, 1:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Sikhanyisiwe!
I hope you are doing well today.
12/09/23, 1:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. To provide you with a better understanding of the offer letter, I would like to assist you in breaking down the fee structure of Lovely Professional University.
12/09/23, 1:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: *On-Campus Accommodation*

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee = $975*2 = $1950
2. Per Annum Accommodation plus food Cost = $1675
3. Per Annum Examination Fee = $150
3. Per Annum Health Insurance = $50

The total cost of education with off-campus accommodation = $3825.
12/09/23, 1:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Off-Campus accommodation*

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee = $975*2 = $1950
2. Per Annum Accommodation Cost = $1000 or less
3. Per Annum Examination Fee = $150
3. Per Annum Health Insurance = $50

The total cost of education with off-campus accommodation = $3150.
12/09/23, 1:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Compared to the on-campus accommodation, if you prefer more affordable housing and don't want to stay on campus, you can choose off-campus accommodation. The approximate annual cost for off-campus accommodation, including food expenses, is around $1000, you will also have the option to cook your own meals.

To find off-campus accommodation options, you can connect with Edoofians who are already staying off-campus. They will assist you in finding suitable accommodation. If you don't know any Edoofians, we will help you connect with them closer to your arrival date so that they can guide you.

It's important to note that LPU doesn't force anyone to choose the hostel. They encourage students to visit the campus, see the options available, and then decide whether they want to stay on campus or off campus.
14/09/23, 5:07 pm - +263 77 876 0238: How are you Mr Milan Singh , i hope you are doing well .

I hope this message finds you well and I find you in high spirits. Please excuse me for the above messages and for not being able to connect with you earlier, I was caught up with a few meetings yesterday and hence couldn't check your message.
30/09/23, 4:41 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: However, I have had the opportunity to review your message today, and I'm here to assist you now. Regarding your passport's validity, I previously mentioned that it's ideal for a passport to have at least six months of validity beyond your intended travel date.

That said, with a four-month validity, you may still be able to travel to some destinations, including India. To ensure a smooth travel experience and to avoid any potential issues, I would encourage you to reach out to the Indian Embassy. 

They should be able to provide you with more specific information and potential solutions to address the challenge you're currently facing. This will help ensure that your travel plans proceed as smoothly as possible.

12/10/23, 2:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are really welcome @263778760238. Please take care of you and your family.
17/10/23, 1:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Sikhanyisiwe, How are you all doing?
25/10/23, 4:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Sikhanyisiwe, I hope you are doing well. 

Kindly excuse me for not attending your messages yesterday as it was a holiday on the occasion of Dussehra. I am glad to know that your parents are discharged from the Hospital. I hope there is improvement in their health.
26/10/23, 3:04 pm - +263 77 876 0238: Well I get what you are saying Ms.Ashi and your concern but then again if I commence my second semester am quite sure I have to catch up on what I have missed on the first semester right.
26/10/23, 3:06 pm - +263 77 876 0238: And that will real drain me because I will want to make sure that I pass my first year
26/10/23, 3:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I can understand your concern dear, let me inform you that once you arrive in India in January 2024, your academic journey will kick off with Semester 2 of your degree program. This is where your formal coursework will begin.

On that note, let us also get into the term off, which is essentially a structured break during the academic year. This period coincides with the summer vacation and offers you a unique opportunity. 

During the term off, you will focus on catching up with the material from Semester 1. The primary aim here is to ensure that you are in sync with your fellow students and won't fall behind in your studies. Typically, term off classes are scheduled from May to July.
26/10/23, 3:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: After this dedicated period of study during the summer vacation, you will be well-prepared to resume your regular academic schedule. You will seamlessly transition into Semester 3, continuing your education alongside the classmates who initially started their studies in August 2023.

This approach allows you to strike a balance between your academic progress and the need for additional preparation time, making sure you're fully equipped to excel in your degree program. I hope this gives you a bit more insight?
26/10/23, 3:18 pm - +263 77 876 0238: If that's the case then I guess l will continue with others in January 2024 and thank you for helping me out I was really worried since others started in August.
26/10/23, 3:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: No worries dear, we can understand your situation. I am pleased that we are in sync. Now, let's also get into how a student manages their tuition fees during term-offs. As you are already aware, your tuition fee per semester stands at $975. Given that you will be covering two semesters (Semester 1 and Semester 2) during your term off, the total tuition fee due for your first year will amount to $1950.
26/10/23, 3:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In addition to the tuition fees, there are a couple of essential charges to consider. The per annum examination fee comes to $150, and the health insurance fee amounts to $50. When you combine these fees, the total amount payable to the university for your first year of education totals $2150.
26/10/23, 3:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I trust that we are in agreement with this breakdown of fees?
26/10/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 876 0238: Yes I get it Ms.Ashi
26/10/23, 3:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let's discuss the payment of the fees. The total fee of $2150 that we just discussed does not need to be paid all at once.

As you have already paid a registration fee of $750, this amount will be adjusted against your total fees. Therefore, the remaining balance is $1400, which can be conveniently disbursed throughout the year according to the following schedule:

1. $467 in the month of October 2023.
2. $467 in the month of January 2024.
3. $466 in the month of April 2024.
26/10/23, 3:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan allows you to spread out the financial commitment over several months, making it more manageable and accommodating your financial needs. I hope you are clear with this as well?
26/10/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 876 0238: Yes everything is clear I will also discuss it with my parents since they are offline and hear what they are saying because now I am discussing this with you to see what is best for me .
26/10/23, 3:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @263778760238 It's important to ensure that the fees for the first part are paid in October to secure your registration, and then you can plan for the one-time payment of the subsequent parts according to the schedule. I hope you are clear with this?
26/10/23, 3:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, Please take your time and discuss regarding term-off with your parents. We will reconnect tomorrow at 12:00pm to discuss further. <This message was edited>
