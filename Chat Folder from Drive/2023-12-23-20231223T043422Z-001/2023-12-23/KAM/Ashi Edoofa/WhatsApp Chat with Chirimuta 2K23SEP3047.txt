17/10/23, 1:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
17/10/23, 1:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
17/10/23, 1:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
17/10/23, 1:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
17/10/23, 1:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?

So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:00 PM.
17/10/23, 1:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

19/10/23, 3:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Friday( 20th of October).
19/10/23, 3:46 pm - +263 71 563 6867: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 3:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Tuesday/Friday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:
https://chat.whatsapp.com/D1lgpTNkkSkLQjVCdEkNN5
19/10/23, 3:46 pm - +263 71 563 6867: For question 1
19/10/23, 3:47 pm - +263 71 563 6867: Thank you for understanding ma'am
19/10/23, 3:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Chirimuta Tinotenda, and my EWYL group name is Chirimuta EWYL23E0782. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on Friday to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
19/10/23, 3:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
19/10/23, 3:51 pm - +263 71 563 6867: Noted, thank you ma'am
19/10/23, 3:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are on the same page. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *B.Tech (Electrical Engineering)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
19/10/23, 4:00 pm - +263 71 563 6867: The course is Electrical and electronic engineering
19/10/23, 4:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @263715636867. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
19/10/23, 4:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
19/10/23, 4:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
19/10/23, 4:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
19/10/23, 4:03 pm - +263 71 563 6867: Confirmed ma'am
19/10/23, 4:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
19/10/23, 4:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
19/10/23, 4:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
19/10/23, 4:05 pm - +263 71 563 6867: Is it so ma'am?
19/10/23, 4:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes dear
19/10/23, 4:06 pm - +263 78 396 5838: Correct mam
19/10/23, 4:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
19/10/23, 4:07 pm - +263 71 563 6867: Ok thank you ma'am
19/10/23, 4:08 pm - +263 71 563 6867: Yes
19/10/23, 4:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
19/10/23, 4:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
19/10/23, 4:09 pm - +263 71 563 6867: Yes ma'am
19/10/23, 4:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
19/10/23, 4:13 pm - +263 71 563 6867: So the 750 will be deducted from the 2800
19/10/23, 4:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
19/10/23, 4:14 pm - +263 71 563 6867: So the ewyl funds can they also pay the amount
19/10/23, 4:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263715636867, Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
19/10/23, 4:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
19/10/23, 4:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education. <This message was edited>
19/10/23, 4:25 pm - +263 71 563 6867: Ok ma'am, so suppose l have been doing ewyl program whilst in my home country and maybe l have earned 1000credits, can those credits be used to pay for the amount upon arrival in lndia, am not referring to the registration fee
19/10/23, 4:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263715636867. You can surely use your EWYL credits in your university fees. I would encourage you to be more engaged in your EWYL journey.
19/10/23, 4:30 pm - +263 71 563 6867: Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is Ms Saloni ___ and he/she has scheduled my session for ___20 October 2023_____*(mention the date)
19/10/23, 4:30 pm - +263 71 563 6867: I see it ma'am
19/10/23, 4:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @263715636867 All the best for tomorrow
19/10/23, 4:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/10/23, 4:32 pm - +263 71 563 6867: I only have a few questions
19/10/23, 4:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @263715636867, Please go ahead with your queries, I'll be happy to help you.
19/10/23, 4:33 pm - +263 71 563 6867: So it like the scholarship percentage will just remain at 50% or it will increase
19/10/23, 4:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me share some insight with you @263715636867, Your scholarship percentage will be decided based on your results, SOP form and other documents. 50% scholarship is the minimum scholarship dear.
19/10/23, 4:36 pm - +263 71 563 6867: Or maybe it will increase based on my A level results
19/10/23, 4:36 pm - +263 71 563 6867: Are you referring to my final A level results
19/10/23, 4:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Basically @263715636867, As you are still writing your A level now, your O level will be considered here. Although, you will get more clarity on these as we go ahead with our discussion.
19/10/23, 4:40 pm - +263 71 563 6867: Ok thank you ma'am
19/10/23, 5:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
19/10/23, 5:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
19/10/23, 5:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
19/10/23, 5:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 5:52 pm - +263 78 396 5838: Please can l ask
19/10/23, 5:53 pm - +263 78 396 5838: Wow this is nice l see happy faces thank you for putting smiles on these students
19/10/23, 5:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed Chirimuta. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
19/10/23, 5:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
19/10/23, 5:54 pm - +263 78 396 5838: So after the offer letter that is when we pay the 750 usd
19/10/23, 5:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @263783965838
19/10/23, 5:57 pm - +263 78 396 5838: Oky and it's deadline is 2 weeks after receiving the offer letter
19/10/23, 5:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263783965838 You will get a better clarity as we proceed with the session.
19/10/23, 5:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: May I know if we can move ahead?
19/10/23, 5:59 pm - +263 78 396 5838: Okay thank you
19/10/23, 5:59 pm - +263 78 396 5838: Sure we can
19/10/23, 5:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
19/10/23, 5:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
19/10/23, 5:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
19/10/23, 5:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
19/10/23, 6:01 pm - +263 78 396 5838: Done
19/10/23, 6:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
19/10/23, 6:02 pm - +263 78 396 5838: Okay following
19/10/23, 6:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
19/10/23, 6:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Chirimuta, you as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
19/10/23, 6:10 pm - +263 78 396 5838: Ooh that good to hear
19/10/23, 6:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
19/10/23, 6:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
19/10/23, 6:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
19/10/23, 6:14 pm - +263 78 396 5838: In other words you saying for the next 4 yrs the fee won't change
19/10/23, 6:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Absolutely @263783965838 . You've got it right! Your tuition fees will remain consistent for the duration of your academic journey. However, it's important to note that, since you're applying for admission in 2024, your fee structure will be based on the 2023 academic year. This stability in fees is one of the many ways we at Edoofa are committed to ensuring that your educational experience is both seamless and affordable.
19/10/23, 6:21 pm - +263 78 396 5838: Okay well understood
19/10/23, 6:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. *Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
19/10/23, 6:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
19/10/23, 6:23 pm - +263 78 396 5838: Very clear
19/10/23, 6:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
19/10/23, 6:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
19/10/23, 6:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
19/10/23, 6:30 pm - +263 78 396 5838: Are there any percentage supposed to be paid among with the registration fee or will be paying 300 usd only
19/10/23, 6:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You only need to pay $300 after you receive your offer letter. There are no additional charges beyond this amount.
19/10/23, 6:34 pm - +263 78 396 5838: Okay thank you understood
19/10/23, 6:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
19/10/23, 6:36 pm - +263 78 396 5838: If I'm correct you mentioned about making use of the O level results SOP
19/10/23, 6:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @263783965838, We'll submit your application with your SOP and O level.
19/10/23, 6:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me inform you that When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
19/10/23, 6:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
19/10/23, 6:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
19/10/23, 6:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
19/10/23, 6:41 pm - +263 78 396 5838: So after the publishing of chirimuta's A level results we need to send them here
19/10/23, 6:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263783965838 We'll ask for it once we need the document, kindly don't worry. May I know if we can proceed with the discussion.
19/10/23, 6:42 pm - +263 78 396 5838: Yes we can proceed
19/10/23, 6:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
19/10/23, 6:45 pm - +263 78 396 5838: Very true
19/10/23, 6:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
19/10/23, 6:46 pm - +263 78 396 5838: Yes l agree
19/10/23, 6:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
19/10/23, 6:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
19/10/23, 6:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
19/10/23, 6:49 pm - +263 78 396 5838: Yes so we will pay the 350 usd we once paid again
19/10/23, 6:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly excuse me @263783965838. Could you please elaborate your concern?
19/10/23, 6:52 pm - +263 78 396 5838: Okay we paid an initial amount of 350 usd which was the registration fee which allowed the edoofa to process the admission of chirimuta
19/10/23, 6:54 pm - +263 78 396 5838: So in other words his seat will still be available for the session 2025
19/10/23, 6:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @263783965838,
19/10/23, 6:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: After you made a registration fees, The university will reserved a seat for Chirimuta.
19/10/23, 6:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
19/10/23, 6:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
19/10/23, 7:01 pm - +263 78 396 5838: Yes
19/10/23, 7:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
19/10/23, 7:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
19/10/23, 7:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/10/23, 7:05 pm - +263 78 396 5838: Noo all clear

20/10/23, 2:25 pm - +263 71 563 6867: Zimbabwe has made an improvement in recent years but there is still more space for economic development improvement. Through the career l have chosen, l will play a vital role in Zimbabwe's development by building and maintaining infrastructure, such as power plants and communication networks. l will also help in developing technologies such as water purification systems. l will provide jobs as l will start up my own company. Given opportunity, l would like to work in United States of America because the country has a thriving technology sector, a strong focus on innovation, as well as high standards of living. The difference between electrical and electronics systems is that electrical systems deals with flow of electricity through conductors and conversion of electrical energy into other forms, while electronic systems are concerned with the flow of electrons through semiconductors and the conversion of electrical energy into signals or data. Capacitors consist of two conductive plates separated by a dielectric material. When a voltage is applied to the plates, an electric field is created between them. This electric field stores the energy in the form of a potential difference, or voltage. When the capacitor is discharged, the energy is released in the form of an electric current.

https://ggi.ac.in/
18/11/23, 8:47 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Chirimuta,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
18/11/23, 8:47 am - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
18/11/23, 8:49 am - +263 78 396 5838: Good morning sir yes we have gone through the offer letter
18/11/23, 8:50 am - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.

The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
18/11/23, 8:50 am - +263 78 396 5838: Yes we can move forward
18/11/23, 8:51 am - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Gulzar Group of Institutions, rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
18/11/23, 8:51 am - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
18/11/23, 8:55 am - +263 78 396 5838: 1 tuition fee $1200usd 
2 hostel fee $1200usd 
3 it's $750 but u mentioned earlier that edoofa will pay 150 so we have to pay $600 usd
18/11/23, 8:56 am - +263 78 396 5838: Sorry tuition fee it's $1225 usd
18/11/23, 8:58 am - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly, you are absolutely correct @263783965838. I would like to provide some additional details regarding your offer letter from the Gulzar Group of Institutes. As you can see, following the scholarship, your annual tuition fee amounts to $1225.

In the first year, it is compulsory for students to select on-campus hostel accommodation, primarily because the university needs to complete their Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) formalities. However, from the second year onwards, students have the flexibility to choose off-campus housing if they prefer, as they would have become more familiar with the area and likely formed connections with their classmates.
18/11/23, 8:59 am - +263 78 396 5838: Okay thank you so what you saying is it's a must for the first year students to be on campus hostels
18/11/23, 9:02 am - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263783965838, Yes for the first year students it is compulsory to opt on-campus hostel accommodation as they have to complete the FRRO process. Gulzar Group of Institutes places a strong emphasis on student safety as a top priority. To ensure that students have an affordable and comfortable living experience in the hostels, the university has designed its accommodations with the well-being of the students in mind costing $1200. 

The hostel rooms are four-seaters and come equipped with air conditioning. Importantly, the cost of accommodation also covers the expenses for the food/mess service, which includes three meals a day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) for each student.
18/11/23, 9:03 am - +263 78 396 5838: What do you mean by four seater
18/11/23, 9:06 am - Ashi Edoofa: @263783965838 Four-seater rooms are shared by the four people however, I would like to share that the rooms are well enough for the four people with air conditioning, I hope you are clear.
18/11/23, 9:06 am - +263 78 396 5838: Yes we are
18/11/23, 9:07 am - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Furthermore, the university intentionally assigns roommates to students to foster a supportive and communal atmosphere, enabling students to rely on their peers for assistance and companionship. 

This approach enhances the overall living experience and contributes to a sense of security and camaraderie within the student community. I hope you have taken note of this and this clarifies the tuition fee and the accommodation facilities for you?
18/11/23, 9:08 am - +263 78 396 5838: Yes
18/11/23, 9:08 am - Ashi Edoofa: In light of this, let us move forward with our discussion. As you are now familiar with your annual fee at Gulzar Group of Institutes, let me outline the various facilities and services covered by the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living/Accommodation Costs
3. Food Costs
4. Library Fee
5. 24-Hour Wifi Access
6. Maintenance Fee
7. Water Bill
8. Electricity Bill
18/11/23, 9:08 am - Ashi Edoofa: These components collectively make up the comprehensive package that you will receive as part of your university fee, ensuring a well-rounded and hassle-free educational experience. I hope we are together so far and this resonates with you?
18/11/23, 9:08 am - +263 78 396 5838: Yes
18/11/23, 9:10 am - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we have established the tuition fee at $1225 and accommodation fee at $1200, making his total annual education cost $2425, let me guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. Through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
18/11/23, 9:10 am - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
18/11/23, 9:12 am - +263 78 396 5838: Yes
18/11/23, 9:14 am - Ashi Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earn scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
18/11/23, 9:15 am - Ashi Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2425. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2425 - $1000 = $1425, which will need to be paid by your parents/guardians.
18/11/23, 9:15 am - Ashi Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
18/11/23, 9:16 am - +263 78 396 5838: So after the scholarship percentage the remaining balance is $2425 per year
18/11/23, 9:20 am - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263783965838. To facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Gulzar Group of Institutes.

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1225
2. Per Annum On-Campus Accommodation Fee - $1200

Total per annum cost of education: $1225 + $1200  = $2425
18/11/23, 9:21 am - +263 78 396 5838: What about the uniform fee and other amounts listed just below the table
18/11/23, 9:26 am - Ashi Edoofa: null
18/11/23, 9:27 am - Ashi Edoofa: Yes dear, Let me share more about the same as the students can refer to the offer letter for details on uniform fees ($50) and AIU fees (varies, typically below $200). These are one-time payments and should be made when the student arrives in India, along with the first part of the fee (August 2024).

Regarding the University Exam Fee and ERP Fee (approximately $40, subject to revision) should be paid every semester, along with the first-semester fee.
18/11/23, 9:27 am - +263 78 396 5838: Sorry l don't have data for a WhatsApp call
18/11/23, 9:28 am - +263 78 396 5838: So these amounts are not in the $2425
18/11/23, 9:29 am - +263 78 396 5838: And about the amount is it paid in installments or its needed once
18/11/23, 9:39 am - Ashi Edoofa: . <This message was edited>
18/11/23, 9:43 am - +263 78 396 5838: Sir
18/11/23, 9:45 am - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is correct. The components mentioned in the letter are not part of the $2425 intended to cover your cost of education and living expenses. Instead, these are one-time costs that are to be paid after you arrive in India.

Rest assured, you have the flexibility to make these payments according to the payment plan for your university fees by combining them. While you are in your home country, the only cost you need to address is your university registration fee of $600, which we will discuss soon. I hope this clarifies the query you had, providing you with a better perspective?
18/11/23, 9:46 am - +263 78 396 5838: Yes
18/11/23, 9:48 am - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that @263783965838, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter.
18/11/23, 9:49 am - +263 78 396 5838: Before we proceed l have a question
18/11/23, 9:49 am - Ashi Edoofa: Sure, Please go ahead with your query.
18/11/23, 9:50 am - +263 78 396 5838: Any hope that more offer letters are coming along our way
18/11/23, 9:54 am - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263783965838, Let me inform you that this is the first offer letter we have received for Chirimuta. The other university are also processing the offer letter for him, please be assured that we will share an update with you. With this, May I now if we can proceed and discuss more about the registration fees?
18/11/23, 9:55 am - +263 78 396 5838: Yes
18/11/23, 10:00 am - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, As previously mentioned, the registration fee of $750 is not an additional cost; instead, it's a part of your first-year tuition fee. Therefore, it will be adjusted against the total fee of $2425 for the first year. 

Consequently, the remaining fee that you will be required to pay after [name] arrives in India will be $2425 - $750 = $1675. This amount can be conveniently paid in two installments of $838 and $837, with a six-month gap between them.
18/11/23, 10:00 am - Ashi Edoofa: The first installment can be paid either before your arrival in India or within three days of his arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.

I hope this information is clear and we both have a shared understanding of this arrangement?
18/11/23, 10:02 am - +263 78 396 5838: Sorry to ask this how many months are in a semester in India
18/11/23, 10:08 am - Ashi Edoofa: @263783965838 Please don't be sorry, let me share that as you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 4-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 8 semesters in your degree. With this, I hope you are clear that in India one semester is of 6months. <This message was edited>
18/11/23, 10:10 am - +263 78 396 5838: Okay l understand
18/11/23, 10:14 am - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education
18/11/23, 10:15 am - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 1st, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
18/11/23, 10:16 am - +263 78 396 5838: Which $300 are you talking about the one concerning the uniform fee
18/11/23, 10:18 am - +263 78 396 5838: Earlier we mentioned about other offer letters coming through   so in the case that we wait for other offer letters and we don't get any and we didn't pay the 750 what will happen
18/11/23, 10:45 am - Ashi Edoofa: No dear, I believe there has been some misunderstanding. Let me share that when the student apply for the admission they are entitled to pay $300 as the processing fees, however as you have applied with Edoofa this fees is waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
18/11/23, 10:46 am - Ashi Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
18/11/23, 10:46 am - Ashi Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
18/11/23, 10:46 am - Ashi Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Gulzar Group of Institutes and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
18/11/23, 10:49 am - +263 78 396 5838: Yes but the question which tinotenda was asking yesterday was what if he rejects this offer or we didn't make it to pay the 600 on time and no other offer letters comes what will be the next step
18/11/23, 11:08 am - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @263783965838, Let me assist you regarding your concern that if you ended up missing the opportunity given by Gulzar Group of Institutes, you would lose out on the scholarship from Gulzar and won't be able to join it in the future. Moreover as you are concerned that you will note receive any other offer letter in the future, I want to assure you that we have already shared his application with other universities for a scholarship application and we are currently waiting for an update from them.  

I hope this clarifies the query you had, providing you with a better perspective?
18/11/23, 11:08 am - Ashi Edoofa: Also, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
18/11/23, 11:09 am - +263 78 396 5838: No can you elaborate
18/11/23, 11:10 am - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Gulzar Group of Institutes by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Gulzar without risking losing out on the scholarship.
18/11/23, 11:10 am - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Gulzar to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Gulzar, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
18/11/23, 11:14 am - +263 78 396 5838: Yes all clear now
18/11/23, 11:17 am - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to know that @263783965838, now in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
18/11/23, 11:18 am - +263 78 396 5838: Yes sure
18/11/23, 11:20 am - Ashi Edoofa: Let me share the same, Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of December 1st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of January 1st, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
18/11/23, 11:21 am - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before *December 1st, 2023*

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
18/11/23, 11:22 am - +263 78 396 5838: Can u elaborate more about the payment method
18/11/23, 11:28 am - +263 78 396 5838: And any possibilities to shift the deadline to at least mid Dec or it's impossible
18/11/23, 11:43 am - Ashi Edoofa: Sure, Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
18/11/23, 11:43 am - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
18/11/23, 11:43 am - +263 78 396 5838: Harare
18/11/23, 11:44 am - Ashi Edoofa: @263783965838 Before we shed more light on your concern, I would like to understand why you want to shift the deadline, May I please know regarding this?
18/11/23, 11:45 am - +263 78 396 5838: Short notification need to run around to look for the money usually my father gets his salary mid December that's why we wanted a shift of date if its possible
18/11/23, 12:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting us know dear, we will discuss more about this however before that let me share the payment modes with you and complete our on going discussion. Please be assured that I have taken a note of your concern.
18/11/23, 12:09 pm - +263 78 396 5838: Thank you very much for giving me an listening ear  

And yes let's proceed
18/11/23, 12:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. I believe you will be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
18/11/23, 12:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
18/11/23, 12:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
18/11/23, 12:11 pm - +263 78 396 5838: And after paying how can we notify you that we have made a payment
18/11/23, 12:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me share that once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
18/11/23, 12:31 pm - +263 78 396 5838: Okay so how soon can we get response for our issue of deadline
18/11/23, 12:39 pm - +263 71 563 6867: hello sir
18/11/23, 12:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I genuinely appreciate your openness in sharing an update. I understand the challenges you have mentioned that your father gets his salary in the mid of the month. However as we have processed your application in a timely manner and you have been awarded with the Benefits of Endowment Plan but understanding your concern, we will try to communicate with the University officials and request a flexible plan for you.  In order to understand the situation better, I would like to know what's the minimum amount that you can make with the due date.

In the meantime, Let's continue our discussion for the offer letter shared by Gulzar Group of Institutions.

Each university has its unique strengths, and we aim to provide you with diverse options for your higher education.

Have you considered this transfer option?

11/12/23, 10:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To assist you further and provide clarity on the breakdown of your university registration fee, we have requested the accounts team to provide a summary. We have made every effort to obtain this information, and we are now ready to share it with you. Please find the details below, and kindly review them. If you come across any discrepancies or have any questions, do not hesitate to reach out. However, if everything appears to be in order, please confirm that you have received and acknowledged the provided information.
11/12/23, 10:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Name of Student: Chirimuta Tinotenda
University Name: Gulzar Group of Institutes

Registration Fee Due: $750
Endowment Grant: $150
Fee to be paid by the student/parent: $750 - $150 = $600

Payment Mode Used:  Cash to Mr. Rajan
International Transfer Charges: $42 (7% of the amount to be paid by the student/parent)

Total amount to be deposited including Charges: $600 + $42 = $642

Amount paid for the due registration fee: $214 (Paid on 1-Dec-2023)

Balance Amount Due: $642 - $214 = $428

As per the payment plan shared by the university, from the remaining balance of $428 you need to pay $100 on or before the *15th December 2023* as discussed earlier. It's worth noting that the earlier you make this payment, the sooner you'll be able to complete your university admission process.

18/12/23, 10:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @263783965838 <This message was edited>
19/12/23, 12:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Chirimuta,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
19/12/23, 12:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly. 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
19/12/23, 1:09 pm - +263 71 563 6867: We did go through the offer letter
19/12/23, 1:10 pm - +263 71 563 6867: Good afternoon sir
19/12/23, 1:10 pm - +263 71 563 6867: So the program fee, its 2450 per semester or yearly?
19/12/23, 1:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263715636867 We will discussing the same in the discussion today, As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.

The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
19/12/23, 1:23 pm - +263 71 563 6867: Ok sir  we can proceed
19/12/23, 1:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any queries you have. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
19/12/23, 1:32 pm - +263 71 563 6867: Its saying 1225 for the tuition fee
19/12/23, 1:36 pm - +263 71 563 6867: 2. Duration 4 years
3. Admission fee 200usd
4. Registration 700usd
19/12/23, 1:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 4-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 8 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $1225 making your per annum tuition fee ($1225*2) = $2450. Is that clear?
19/12/23, 1:44 pm - +263 71 563 6867: Without the hostel fee?
19/12/23, 1:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263715636867, Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -

*1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
19/12/23, 1:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
19/12/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 396 5838: So how much is one suppose to pay per semester
19/12/23, 2:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263783965838 May I know for which accommodation are you asking for? <This message was edited>
19/12/23, 2:09 pm - +263 71 563 6867: l really wanted the university but the fees are high hence my parents won't afford
19/12/23, 2:14 pm - +263 71 563 6867: If there was an option for scholarship percentage increase or other better ones, it would be better
19/12/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 396 5838: How is the 1225 per semester paid
19/12/23, 2:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I understand your concern dear, I would like to share that it is totally fine having these concerns. We understand that the cost of education at LPU University is not as per your expectations. Considering that LPU University is one of the best private universities in India that focuses more on branding and that is the reason they have good exposure for the students, however, it's a bit challenging for the parents to afford Higher Education at LPU.
19/12/23, 2:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263783965838 I am not able to understand your query please elaborate
19/12/23, 2:33 pm - +263 71 563 6867: Its okay, but is there any hope again for other offer letters or am now restricted to Gulzar now
19/12/23, 2:34 pm - +263 71 563 6867: As in,  is the maximum number of offer letters 2 or l might receive other ones in future
19/12/23, 2:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: No Dear, There is no maximum number of offer letter for Edoofians however we have only received these two offer letters for you. If we receive any other offer letter for you we will definitely share it with you. For now, Can we move ahead with the discussion for the offer letter from LPU?
19/12/23, 2:44 pm - +263 71 563 6867: Ok sir, we can proceed
19/12/23, 2:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
19/12/23, 2:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and they would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?
19/12/23, 2:50 pm - +263 71 563 6867: Yes clear
19/12/23, 2:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
19/12/23, 2:53 pm - +263 78 396 5838: Yes
19/12/23, 2:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $700 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on January 1st, 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
19/12/23, 2:55 pm - +263 78 396 5838: Yes
19/12/23, 3:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. With this, your registration fees would be $550. I hope you understand?
19/12/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 396 5838: Yes understood
19/12/23, 3:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this, Let me share a few insights into the university with you -
19/12/23, 3:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable. 

It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.
19/12/23, 3:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/

19/12/23, 3:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263783965838 There is no such guidelines for the uniform however in some course there is a requirement to wear the formals during lectures, however while you are in campus you can wear casual clothes
19/12/23, 3:38 pm - +263 78 396 5838: Thank you
19/12/23, 3:38 pm - +263 78 396 5838: And paying the 1225 is there a payment plan
19/12/23, 3:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @263783965838
19/12/23, 3:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, You will be given a flexible payment plan so that you can make the payment without any inconvenience
19/12/23, 3:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, I would also encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter from LPU with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better.
