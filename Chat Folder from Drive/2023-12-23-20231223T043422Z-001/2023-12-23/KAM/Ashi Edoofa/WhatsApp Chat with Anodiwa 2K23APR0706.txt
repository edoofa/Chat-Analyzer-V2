I hope this message finds you well. I am *Mr. Shivjeet, Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As per our commitment, following the successful closure of the 2023 intake, I am delighted to inform you that we are now fully prepared to commence the university application process for your higher studies, targeting the intake of 2024. 

Before we embark on your admission journey, I'd like to inquire about your well-being and that of your family. How have the past few months been for you and your family?

08/09/23, 7:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings! I hope you're enjoying this beautiful evening. How are you doing today?
30/10/23, 5:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parent.

I have received an insight that you wanted to inquire about Anodiwa's admission process and payment. However, I was hoping to discuss the same with you here in the admission group. Unfortunately with repeated reminders I received no response from your end. So if you are currently available now. Shall we proceed with the session?
02/11/23, 2:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and my dear Edoofian.

I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed for quite some time now. This has raised some concerns on my part, which is affecting your scholarship application. As we have already mentioned before, we will be proceeding with your admission process after *August 2023*. Almost all of the student's parents have already completed their admission process for the 2024 intake, which puts us behind schedule by 2 Months now. I understand that there might be challenges regarding this. However, I would only requires one hour of your time for our session, and with pure consistency, we can easily wrap it up during that time frame.
02/11/23, 2:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *I would like to inform you that there are certain opportunities awaiting your admission process that will be of great help to your finances. This opportunity has been greatly appreciated by your fellow peers and their parents, and I would not like you to miss out on it as well. Hence, if you're ready now, please let me know so that we can proceed with the session.*
06/11/23, 6:05 am - +263 71 291 4917: Thank you Sheevjet for your kind gesture. Am sorry for the inc9nveniences that couod have been caused by our inconsistences as regards attending our admissions sessions. We as Anodiwa's proud Edoof8an parents mentioned earlier that we are sole traders usually we are always out of network working from hand to mouth. Anything that requires out attention as parents might have slipped through the fingers mostly because we will either be out of data or network. Im.usually driving nearly daily for the most part of the day do in Zimbabwe we experience serious intermittent internet network problems. However am sure ad from the *16th of November 2023* Anodiwa will vlbe through with her final examinations and we as her parents would be prepared to proceed with the 1hour sessions without any problems. Please kindly bear with us and allow us to proceed with the sessions as from the 16th of November 2023. Thank you in advance👏🏻👏🏻🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
06/11/23, 6:08 am - +263 71 291 4917: However, as I  asked from Saloni earlier on, we are prepared to get a copy of our great daughter's admission breakdown so we can schedule all the payments plan in advance as we await her final results.
06/11/23, 12:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your understanding and for providing this update. I completely understand that you may have some challenges due to network issues and your busy schedules. It's great to hear that Anodiwa will be finishing her final examinations on the 16th of November 2023, and you'll be ready to proceed with the sessions after that date.

Regarding your request for Anodiwa's admission breakdown, we can certainly provide you with that information. When we proceed with the session.
06/11/23, 3:51 pm - +263 71 291 4917: Thank you. We will surely await to get all finer details as  early as possible 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼

13/12/23, 4:05 pm - +263 71 694 6404: I think maybe in mid January Ma'am
13/12/23, 4:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know dear, in that case you need to connect with your school and ask them to provide you the statement of entry for your exams in which they should mention you subject combination. I hope you understand?
13/12/23, 4:13 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Okay ma'am let me look for it
13/12/23, 4:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
13/12/23, 4:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
13/12/23, 4:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
13/12/23, 4:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
13/12/23, 5:01 pm - +263 71 694 6404: I have reviewed them ma'am
13/12/23, 5:01 pm - +263 71 694 6404: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 5:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Perfect @263716946404
13/12/23, 5:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
13/12/23, 5:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
13/12/23, 5:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.
13/12/23, 7:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263716946404 May I know dear if you have taken a note of my messages?
13/12/23, 10:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings, As I am looking forward for your response however, since it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
14/12/23, 3:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Anodiwa, Wishing you a good day!

During our session yesterday, we were looking forward for your response as we have not received your response. I would like to know if you are available for the discussion now so that we can move ahead with your admission journey?
14/12/23, 3:12 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Yes l have ma'am
14/12/23, 3:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response @263716946404. May I know if you are ready for the session please?
14/12/23, 3:17 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Good afternoon
14/12/23, 3:19 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Yes um ready lets continue
14/12/23, 3:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Let's continue with the second benefit of Endowment Plan
14/12/23, 3:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
14/12/23, 3:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
14/12/23, 3:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/12/23, 3:23 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Yes it does
14/12/23, 3:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. *Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750 , this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $650.
14/12/23, 3:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $650. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750 . Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/12/23, 4:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263716946404 Are we still connected?
15/12/23, 5:23 am - +263 71 694 6404: Ma'am it was raining this side so we had no network .
Um sorry for the inconvenience caused
15/12/23, 5:26 am - +263 71 694 6404: Yes ma'am
15/12/23, 5:26 am - +263 71 694 6404: Good morning
15/12/23, 11:39 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Anodiwa, I hope you are doing well.
15/12/23, 11:39 am - Ashi Edoofa: I understand dear that you had network challenges yesterday. May I know if you are available now for the session ?
15/12/23, 3:06 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Hello ma'am
15/12/23, 3:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings @263716946404
15/12/23, 3:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: May I know if you are available for the session?
15/12/23, 3:09 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Yes l am available
15/12/23, 3:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation, Let's proceed with the fourth benefit of Endowment Plan.
15/12/23, 3:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
15/12/23, 3:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
15/12/23, 3:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $650, you'll need to make a payment of $325 on or before December 15, 2023. The remaining $325 should be paid by January 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
15/12/23, 3:22 pm - +263 71 694 6404: No ma'am l have no question
15/12/23, 3:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
15/12/23, 3:41 pm - +263 71 694 6404: No ma'am l was not aware but l be delighted if u highlight me
15/12/23, 3:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
15/12/23, 3:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
15/12/23, 3:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
15/12/23, 3:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
15/12/23, 7:32 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Yes ma'am
15/12/23, 7:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
15/12/23, 10:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 03:00 pm. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
16/12/23, 6:38 am - +263 71 694 6404: Yes they won't be able
16/12/23, 6:38 am - +263 71 694 6404: Okay ma'am
16/12/23, 3:02 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Hello ma'am
16/12/23, 3:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Anodiwa, Wishing you a good day!
16/12/23, 3:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Are you ready for the session?
16/12/23, 3:18 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Same to u ma'am
16/12/23, 3:18 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Yes l am
16/12/23, 3:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, With respect to our on going conversation yesterday,  I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
16/12/23, 3:25 pm - +263 71 694 6404: I agree ma'am
16/12/23, 3:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
16/12/23, 3:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
16/12/23, 3:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
16/12/23, 3:27 pm - +263 71 694 6404: What if one decides to write their examinations in June 2024
16/12/23, 3:27 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Yeah its clear
16/12/23, 3:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Same applies dear
16/12/23, 3:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
16/12/23, 3:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
16/12/23, 3:36 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Okay ma'am so you are saying its possible to get a diploma without even having  a point
16/12/23, 3:36 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Yes ma'am
16/12/23, 3:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263716946404
16/12/23, 3:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
16/12/23, 3:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
16/12/23, 3:50 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Okay ma'am
16/12/23, 3:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
16/12/23, 3:53 pm - +263 71 694 6404: No ma'am l don't
16/12/23, 3:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: So are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
16/12/23, 3:54 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Very excited😊
16/12/23, 4:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information. <This message was edited>

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.

With respect to our conversation, I would like to know if you are ready for the discussion about your offer letter from the *Quest Group of Institutions ​*. I am looking forward for your response, hence could you please share your response with us?

22/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Thank you so much for this wonderful opportunity😊.....I am honored to have been selected and I look forward to joining the university community💫
22/12/23, 2:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @263716946404. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.

The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
22/12/23, 2:10 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Yes ma'am
22/12/23, 2:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) What's your Miscellaneous and Uniform Fee (applicable for first year only) ?
4) What's your University Related and Examination fee [Per annum] ?
5) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
22/12/23, 2:19 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Okay ma'am
22/12/23, 2:29 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Annual Tuition Fee after scholarship - 900usd
Miscellaneous and uniform charges 100usd payable extra in 1st yr 
University related and examination fee- 25usd per semester
Hostel fee 775 usd
Registration fee- 1000usd
22/12/23, 2:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response with us @263716946404. As you can see in your offer letter from the Quest Group of Institutions, after the scholarship your per annum tuition fee is $900.
						
Along with this, there is a $50 fee covering the university's regular examination fee, your library fee, and ERP Fee, along with other basic expenses such as the Wi-Fi facility. When you add this $50 to the per annum tuition fee of $900, the total comes out to be $950.
22/12/23, 2:33 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Okay ma'am
22/12/23, 2:35 pm - +263 71 694 6404: So does this mean for the annual tuition fee after scholarship l will be paying 950 usd
22/12/23, 2:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Correct @263716946404. Let me also brief you on the accommodation as well:  The on-campus accommodations at the Quest campus have different categories and the pricing for every room is different as mentioned in your offer letter.
						
However, all the international students prefer to stay off-campus as it is a lot cheaper and they get more freedom. We would advise the same for you. The university officials will help you find off-campus accommodations and help you settle in after you report to the campus.
22/12/23, 2:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: If you opt for accommodation outside the Campus, it would be comparatively cheaper, the cost will be around $600 per annum and that would include your food cost as well which means you would have to pay only $30 to $40 per month towards your living expenses making your per annum educational cost $950 + $600 = $1550. I hope you are clear about this?
22/12/23, 3:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263716946404 May I know dear if we are still connected?
22/12/23, 3:12 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Thats better then if they will be helping me
22/12/23, 3:12 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Yes its clear
22/12/23, 3:13 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Yes  ma'am
22/12/23, 3:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed dear, Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
22/12/23, 3:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor their higher education, they can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
22/12/23, 3:15 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Okay ma'am
22/12/23, 3:16 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Yes um clear
22/12/23, 3:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $1550 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $1550 - $1000 = $550 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
22/12/23, 3:20 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Yeah Ewyl really makes education more affordable
22/12/23, 3:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
22/12/23, 3:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Moving ahead, as informed, the registration fee of $750 mentioned in your offer letter will be adjusted against your first year's tuition fee, therefore the amount of tuition fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $950 - $750 = $200. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
22/12/23, 3:23 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Yes its clear
22/12/23, 3:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $750 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as January 3rd, 2023*.
22/12/23, 3:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
22/12/23, 3:28 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Yes please
22/12/23, 3:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a student you will be responsible for the remaining $650 of the registration fee. This $650 can be conveniently paid in two instalments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$325 before the first deadline date of January 3rd, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$325 before the second deadline date of February 3rd, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
22/12/23, 3:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $650 within 15 working days, before *January 3rd, 2024* 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
22/12/23, 3:33 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Yes ma'am
22/12/23, 3:34 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Can l ask ma'am
22/12/23, 3:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, dear. Please go ahead with your question
22/12/23, 3:34 pm - +263 71 694 6404: What if you have a change of heart and lets say you receive another offer letter from another university..what do l do
22/12/23, 3:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
22/12/23, 3:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
22/12/23, 3:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the *Quest Group of Institutions* and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
22/12/23, 3:43 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Yes ma'am...l had Lovely professional university in mind <This message was edited>
22/12/23, 3:43 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Yes its now clear ma'am...thank you
22/12/23, 3:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @~Blee🦋. At the same time, since it is an associated university with Edoofa, we have already shared your application with Lovely Professional University for a scholarship application and we are currently waiting for an update from them.
22/12/23, 3:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Quest, you would lose out on the scholarship from Quest and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
22/12/23, 3:49 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Okay
22/12/23, 3:50 pm - +263 71 694 6404: No l was not aware
22/12/23, 3:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Quest by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Quest without risking losing out on the scholarship.
22/12/23, 3:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Quest to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Quest , the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
22/12/23, 3:54 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Yes ma'am l have now understood
22/12/23, 3:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that you doubt is clear. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
22/12/23, 3:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
22/12/23, 3:58 pm - +263 71 694 6404: No ma'am l stay in Bulawayo
22/12/23, 3:58 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Okay l will inform my Father
22/12/23, 4:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
22/12/23, 4:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.

22/12/23, 4:04 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Okay
22/12/23, 4:06 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Ma'am isn't it possible to pay in Bulawayo because we are far from Harare
22/12/23, 4:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It's possible to make the payment dear, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi's Mukuru for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
22/12/23, 4:27 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Yes
22/12/23, 4:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -
