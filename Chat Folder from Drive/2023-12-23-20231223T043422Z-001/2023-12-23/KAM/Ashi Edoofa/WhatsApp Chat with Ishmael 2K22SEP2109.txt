13/09/23, 3:05 pm - +263 77 722 7975: Ok
14/09/23, 8:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Ishmael. How are you doing this lovely evening?
14/09/23, 8:37 pm - +263 77 722 7975: Good evining sir, we are well and how are you
14/09/23, 8:37 pm - +263 77 722 7975: <Media omitted>
14/09/23, 8:38 pm - +263 77 722 7975: Here is the statement of entry sir
14/09/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for sharing the documents with me, it is well noted by the admission team. We are ready and excited to commence your academic journey for the year 2024. 

To proceed with our discussion, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure. I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure.
14/09/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/09/23, 10:01 pm - +263 77 722 7975: Yes sir i do remember the 6 steps of the procedure
14/09/23, 10:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
14/09/23, 10:17 pm - +263 77 722 7975: Okay, about the 6 steps
The Edoofa team sent me a video of the Founders of Edoofa, Mr Angad, as they were explaining about the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Its benefits to African children of different backgrounds.

The registration process began with the application form and luckily i was found eligible for the scholarship and underwent career counselling with my mentor Mr Sahil. 
I also had to fill the statement of purpose. And after that we wait for offer letters from the universities in India and then we begin the university registration and acceptance letter and then finally apply for a Visa.
14/09/23, 10:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
14/09/23, 10:28 pm - +263 77 722 7975: Yes sir
14/09/23, 10:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.

For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
 
As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
14/09/23, 10:43 pm - +263 77 722 7975: Yes, this will definitely ease the strain in the finances
14/09/23, 10:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing to hear that, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
14/09/23, 10:47 pm - +263 77 722 7975: Yes
14/09/23, 10:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
14/09/23, 10:48 pm - +263 77 722 7975: No i wasn't aware
14/09/23, 10:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:
14/09/23, 10:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.

3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
14/09/23, 10:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, choosing the early decision benefits brings two additional advantages:

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.

*The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program*
14/09/23, 10:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Pleasee lt me know once you have gone through these benefits so that we can discuss all of them one by one.
14/09/23, 10:51 pm - +263 77 722 7975: I have gone through the benefits sir
14/09/23, 10:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
14/09/23, 10:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. As you await your A-Level results, initiating the university admission process now positions you as an early applicant. This status comes with the advantage of receiving a provisional letter of intent from the university. This letter will outline your scholarship percentage and associated fees. Once you complete your registration formalities and your results are available, you'll be provided with your Official Admission Letter. This letter will enable you to proceed with your student visa application. I trust this point is now clear to you.
14/09/23, 10:53 pm - +263 77 722 7975: Yes it is now clear
14/09/23, 10:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
14/09/23, 10:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Students now have the reamrkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This can be achieved by making an early decision to initiate the university admission process and securing your seat in advance. By taking this step, you can avail the early decision benefits previously mentioned. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
14/09/23, 10:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you? <This message was edited>
14/09/23, 10:54 pm - +263 77 722 7975: Yes sir
14/09/23, 10:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
14/09/23, 10:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be skillfully adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/09/23, 10:57 pm - +263 77 722 7975: Yes sir
14/09/23, 10:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, we're offering the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
14/09/23, 10:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
14/09/23, 10:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 18, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 18, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 18, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
14/09/23, 10:59 pm - +263 77 722 7975: No sir i have no inquiries
14/09/23, 11:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
14/09/23, 11:01 pm - +263 77 722 7975: No i am not aware sir
14/09/23, 11:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student decides to initiate their admission process before receiving their A-Level results, they gain the advantage of early registration benefits. At this stage, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from entities like Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship percentage as promised.
14/09/23, 11:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there might be a scenario where the student might not achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels. 

In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship. However, if a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university with early decision benefits, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged.
14/09/23, 11:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On the other hand, if a student manages to achieve a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application once the results are available. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how this gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process as per the standard procedures?
14/09/23, 11:05 pm - +263 77 722 7975: Yes it is now clear
15/09/23, 7:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents Ishmael. I hope you are well and blessed. May I know if you are ready to further proceed with the session?
15/09/23, 7:48 pm - +263 77 722 7975: Good evening sir.
We are ready to proceed with the session
15/09/23, 7:50 pm - +263 78 410 0291: Good evening sir
We are well sir,thank you. 
Yes we are ready
15/09/23, 7:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
15/09/23, 8:00 pm - +263 77 722 7975: Yes you are right
15/09/23, 8:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
15/09/23, 8:22 pm - +263 77 722 7975: Yes those will be the left options
15/09/23, 8:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
15/09/23, 8:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the early decision benefits, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for  another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
15/09/23, 8:28 pm - +263 77 722 7975: Yes i am clear with the solution sir
15/09/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
15/09/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
15/09/23, 8:28 pm - +263 77 722 7975: Yes sir
15/09/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
15/09/23, 9:00 pm - +263 77 722 7975: Ok i understand sir
15/09/23, 9:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through all 7 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 7 points clear?
15/09/23, 9:05 pm - +263 77 722 7975: Yes sir i don't have any queries
15/09/23, 9:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright, I’m glad to know that you have understood all of this well! Now, I would like you to take some time and have a discussion with your family concerning the next steps in your university admission journey and update them about the benefits of the early decision. I am sure they would be excited and open to the same opportunity. And we shall connect on Monday at 7:30 PM. Have a great weekend.
15/09/23, 9:07 pm - +263 77 722 7975: Thank you sir, have a blessed weekend
15/09/23, 9:07 pm - +263 78 410 0291: Thank you sir
18/09/23, 7:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Ishmael,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. Please, how was your weekend?
18/09/23, 8:48 pm - +263 78 410 0291: Good evening sir

We are all well sir thank you for contacting us.
18/09/23, 8:51 pm - +263 77 722 7975: Good evening sir, we are well how are you?
18/09/23, 9:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that. I am  too, thank you for asking. Could you let me know if you're available to continue the session at any time now?
18/09/23, 9:00 pm - +263 77 722 7975: Yes i am available sir
18/09/23, 9:01 pm - +263 78 410 0291: Yes sir we can continue
18/09/23, 9:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm pleased to learn that, I'm interested in knowing whether you've had the opportunity to engage in a conversation regarding the advantages of early decision, as we touched upon the previous day..
18/09/23, 9:16 pm - +263 77 722 7975: Yes sir we have had an opportunity and discussed the advantages of the early decision
18/09/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I would be pleased if you let me know how was the discussion on the Early Decision Benefits and what was your thoughts by your parents?
18/09/23, 9:41 pm - +263 77 722 7975: Yes sir, we talked about many benefits actually. Some of them being the fact that if i do not get a minimum of 2 A level passes and i wish to retake my exams, i will get the time and necessary resources to be able to appear for my exams. An my seat will still be reserved with the university. 
There is also an opportunity to mantain the same fee structure even though we are encountering some hikes in university fees, and by the early decision i will be securing my scholarship seat in advance. And my fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023 even if we face some hikes on the fees on the year 2024.
18/09/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear, dear. Now before we move forward and have a conversation regarding the same, may I know if your parents are available with us for this session and if they have any queries that you would like to ask or any concerns that have been bothering you and you would like to share?

Have a great day!
19/09/23, 6:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>

20/09/23, 3:19 pm - +263 78 410 0291: Afternoon sir
We are all fine sir
Thank you for checking
20/09/23, 3:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Are you prepared and ready for our session?
20/09/23, 3:22 pm - +263 78 410 0291: Ishmael is at school now sir
20/09/23, 3:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I now have a better understanding of the situation, and I appreciate you providing this information in advance. It's clear that Ishmael may face some difficulties in attending our session due to school activities. I kindly request both you and Ishmael to be aware that this is a family discussion group, and could also be proceeded exclusively with the parents as well. So, shall we further proceed with the session?
20/09/23, 3:55 pm - +263 78 410 0291: Yes sir we can proceed
20/09/23, 3:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm pleased to learn that. I'm interested in knowing whether you've had the opportunity to engage in a conversation regarding the advantages of early decision, as we touched upon the previous day..
20/09/23, 3:57 pm - +263 78 410 0291: Yes sir i  was following the sessions
20/09/23, 3:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I would be pleased if you let me know how was the discussion on the Early Decision Benefits and what was your thoughts?
20/09/23, 4:09 pm - +263 78 410 0291: The benefits are that if lshmael will not be able too get the required passes he will be able to get his seat it will be reserved with the University,They is still opportunity to maintain the fee structure even though we are encounting some hikes in the University,early discuss will make it easier for him to get his scholarship seat,even though the fees might go up he will still pay same fees as same for 2023
20/09/23, 4:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear, dear. Now before we move forward and have a conversation regarding the same, may I know if   you would like to ask or any concerns that have been bothering you and you would like to share?
20/09/23, 4:17 pm - +263 78 410 0291: From the information that you gave us I'm satisfied sir
20/09/23, 4:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Great! It is good to know all of us are on the same page. I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.*
20/09/23, 4:33 pm - +263 78 410 0291: I  understand sir,we can proceed
20/09/23, 4:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due date will be mentioned.
20/09/23, 4:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?*
20/09/23, 4:37 pm - +263 78 410 0291: Yes i  und
20/09/23, 4:38 pm - +263 78 410 0291: Yes sir i  understand
20/09/23, 4:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is amazing to hear. Alright, please. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
20/09/23, 4:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
20/09/23, 4:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
20/09/23, 4:46 pm - +263 78 410 0291: Yes sir well understood
20/09/23, 4:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great. Now you have two ways to proceed with your child’s university admission process -

*1. Proceed as per the standard procedures*
*2. Proceed with the Early Decision Benefits*

Be assured that I will help you understand the difference between both of them so that you can make a well-informed decision regarding your child’s university admission process. Shall we start with our discussion regarding the same?
20/09/23, 5:00 pm - +263 78 410 0291: Yes sir
20/09/23, 5:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, let us start with the *Standard Registration/University Admission process*-

As you are aware that one’s registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university, to be on the safer side, let us assume that the registration fee is $750 itself.

As per the standard procedures, once you get the offer letter from the university, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of $750.

For example, if you get the offer letter on the 23rd of September and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, the deadline for the registration fee would be the 9th of October 2023 and you would have to make the payment of the fee before then. Are you clear about this?
20/09/23, 5:10 pm - +263 78 410 0291: Yes sir
20/09/23, 5:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great, now let us discuss the *Early Registration/University Admission process -*

As the name states, a student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.

If you do that, you are eligible for all 6 benefits that we discussed earlier. Since the benefit number 3 and 4 helps you ease the registration process, I will be discussing the same in particular and help you understand how that happens -

When we talk about the Early Decision Grant of $150 (benefit number 3)
20/09/23, 5:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To understand the same, let us once again assume that the registration fee due is $750 and if you have a grant of $150, this means that out of the fee due of $750, $150 will be paid by the Edoofa Academic Board on your behalf and hence this leaves your child’s fee due as $750 - $150 = $600.

So, the amount that you will have to pay to reserve/lock your child’s scholarship seat becomes $600.
20/09/23, 5:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

*1. The first part ~ $300* is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 23rd of September, the deadline becomes the 9th of October, 2023)

*2. The second part ~ $300* is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 23rd of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 9th of October 2023, making the second deadline the 9th of November, 2023).
20/09/23, 5:13 pm - +263 78 410 0291: Very clear,i understand sir
20/09/23, 5:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
20/09/23, 5:20 pm - +263 78 410 0291: At moment i am following sir,it is still clear
20/09/23, 5:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, now before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
20/09/23, 5:26 pm - +263 78 410 0291: From my understanding, I have understood that if the fees is $750, 
Edoofa will pay $150
Then will be left with $600,that means $300 will be pain within 15 days and the remaining will be paid within a month
20/09/23, 5:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days.
20/09/23, 5:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. With the standard admission process, as a student you are not paying any more amount of fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until your parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with your admission process.

Please let me know if you are clear on this?
20/09/23, 5:28 pm - +263 78 410 0291: I understand sir
20/09/23, 5:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
20/09/23, 5:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Monday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.

When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *9th October* and *9th November*.
20/09/23, 5:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, If you as parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines ( *9th October* and *9th November*.), you can give us the go-ahead so that we can prepare Ishmael’s application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
20/09/23, 5:33 pm - +263 78 410 0291: Yes sir you can go ahead
20/09/23, 5:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have given us the go-ahead to move forward with Ishmael’s university admission process, I believe you are financially confident that you will be able to manage the registration fee in due time by ( *9th October* and *9th November*.*) and are mentally prepared for the next steps? <This message was edited>
20/09/23, 5:36 pm - +263 78 410 0291: Yes sir i will be able to meet the deadline
20/09/23, 5:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, as you have given us the go-ahead, let us proceed towards preparing Ishmael’s application and forward it to the universities, applicable for the course and suggested by the academic board. Once we get an update from the universities, we will reconnect with you and share the same updates with you. In the meantime, if and when you have any queries, feel free to bring them forward so that we can address them and help you plan for Ishmael’s higher education well.
20/09/23, 5:39 pm - +263 78 410 0291: Oky sir,if I may ask,if he gets the  place in University,is it easy for him to get the passport and visa
20/09/23, 5:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Obtaining the VISA for Ishmeal should be a relatively straightforward process after the university admission process. However, for the passport, the standard procedure that everyone follows will apply.
20/09/23, 5:45 pm - +263 78 410 0291: Oky,sir is there any payment that is needed for processing those documents,
20/09/23, 5:47 pm - +263 78 410 0291: As a family we are suppose to pay for the air ticket if i may ask?

Need to understand,and know hw it all works sir
20/09/23, 5:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that's correct. You'll need to budget for the plane ticket, which typically ranges from $500 to $600, and this payment will be due in July 2024. Additionally, for the VISA application fees, it amounts to $83, which will also be due in July 2024.
20/09/23, 5:52 pm - +263 78 410 0291: Very clear sir
20/09/23, 5:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.
20/09/23, 5:53 pm - +263 78 410 0291: If everything goes well,when is he suppose to land in Lydia sir
20/09/23, 5:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Everything will be alright, please do not worry. Ishmael will safely land at New Delhi, Indira Gandhi International Airport with his colleagues who will be traveling on the same date. After the arrival, I will be there personally to receive him at the airport. <This message was edited>
20/09/23, 6:05 pm - +263 78 410 0291: Thanks you sir,I'm happy to hear that
20/09/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. 

With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
20/09/23, 6:20 pm - +263 78 410 0291: Thank you sir all well understood,will be patient waiting sir.
26/09/23, 1:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ishmael!

26/09/23, 1:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/09/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 410 0291: Good afternoon sir, we are all doing well.

We are very excited Mr Milan
I would like to thank you and your team for working so hard with us,thank you for making this to come soo far.
26/09/23, 3:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome! We will now connect with each other tomorrow at the scheduled time to discuss about the letter. Until then, have a good day!
26/09/23, 4:18 pm - +263 78 410 0291: Thank you sir
27/09/23, 12:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ishmael!

How are you doing today? May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
27/09/23, 12:52 pm - +263 78 410 0291: Afternoon sir 

Yes i managed to go through it
I only need to sort out 
 lshmael's mobile so that he will be able to join us sir
27/09/23, 12:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Galgotias University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
27/09/23, 1:15 pm - +263 78 410 0291: 1.Tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter is USD1000

2.The standard Duration of the course is 4yrs 

3.Admission and Procedure Fee is USD 300
4.Registration Fee is 600
27/09/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a four-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 8 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
27/09/23, 1:27 pm - +263 78 410 0291: Oky sir
27/09/23, 1:28 pm - +263 78 410 0291: That means a semester is a duration of 6 months
27/09/23, 1:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, that is right. Now, I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
27/09/23, 1:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
27/09/23, 1:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
27/09/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 410 0291: Oky i  get it,my question is off-Campus Accommodation how safe is it for students who are coming out of the country sir?
They are not familiar to these place sir?
27/09/23, 1:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes.

Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students. I hope this clears the doubt that you have here, right?
27/09/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 410 0291: I'm more releaved sir  thank you so much for such wonderful explanation
27/09/23, 1:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
27/09/23, 1:48 pm - +263 78 410 0291: I'm following sir
27/09/23, 1:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
27/09/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 410 0291: Yes sir all is clear I'm still following
27/09/23, 1:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
27/09/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 410 0291: Yes sir
27/09/23, 1:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
27/09/23, 1:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 10th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 10th November 2023.*
27/09/23, 1:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *10th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
27/09/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 410 0291: Yes sir i still remember this very clear
27/09/23, 2:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
27/09/23, 2:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
27/09/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 410 0291: No sir we are staying in Bulawayo
27/09/23, 2:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
27/09/23, 2:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
27/09/23, 2:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

22/12/23, 7:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In light of your admission process, As we have shared that one of our partnered universities, Lovely Professional University (LPU), which is among the top 100 universities in India, has been considering your application for the scholarship opportunity. They have mentioned that they would be able to give us an update by the month of January, considering the high volume of applications they have received in the past two months (more than 2000 applications).
22/12/23, 7:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In addition to this, the academic board also mentioned that there are a few more universities willing to put your application in consideration for scholarship opportunities in the month of January. Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter. This approach allows you to have multiple scholarship options, giving you the flexibility to decide on the university for your education in India and then carry out your visa application process the right way.
22/12/23, 7:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this update, I also want to inform you that since we are waiting for updates from the universities, we will be holding our conversation until 20th January and will reconnect around the same time. Until then, we wanted to share these updates with you so that you are well-informed about the process and know what lies ahead. We are thrilled to be a part of this new chapter in your academic journey.
22/12/23, 7:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, now that you are done with your admission process, you are encouraged to channel your energy and focus on your Earn While You Learn (EWYL) journey so that you can maximize the benefits from it. May this period be filled with meaningful learning, personal growth, and amazing opportunities.
