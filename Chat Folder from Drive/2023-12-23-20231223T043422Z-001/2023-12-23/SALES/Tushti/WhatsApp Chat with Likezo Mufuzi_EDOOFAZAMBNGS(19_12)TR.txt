19/12/23, 9:57 am - Tushti: Greetings, Parent and Student!

*I am Ms Tushti, Career Counsellor at Edoofa.*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
19/12/23, 3:50 pm - Tushti: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 am CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
