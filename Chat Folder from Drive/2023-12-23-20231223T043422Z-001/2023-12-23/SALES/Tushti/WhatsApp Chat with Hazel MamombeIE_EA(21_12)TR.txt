21/12/23, 3:46 pm - +263 77 289 2944: Okay, So live in Juru Growth Point in Goromonzi Province. I went to St John's high school Chikwaka also in Goromonzi province where l did both my ordinary and advanced levels. Currently, lam waiting for my advanced level results. I was in the commercial section doing Pure mathematics, Accounts and Business studies. I would like to pursue the course of Accounting because l have always been passionate about accounts. I have two brothers who are both older than me, the first born works at Pick n Pay and the other one in Bulawayo as a bank teller.Iam a very hardworking person who is also good at team work. Also, l interact well with others. However, l tend to have huge trust issues with people.On my free time l usually watch television.
 
My school fees per term rounded to $170 and my father has been responsible for the bills. He will also be supporting me financially for my further education currently, my father is self employed as a small scale farmer and my mother is also self employed as a tailor. They both did their ordinary levels and both went to college. <This message was edited>

22/12/23, 12:01 pm - +263 77 254 1610: Thanks for the platform. Firstly we need to know how the funders operate. Secondly we are parents who wish to see our daughter go to heights in order to attain her career wishes but we are incapacitated by circumstances beyond our control. Be that as it may we can go all the way ,finding all possible means to ascertain that her goals are achieved.
22/12/23, 12:13 pm - Tushti: I am pleased to see that this is a family that priortizes their child's education
22/12/23, 12:14 pm - Tushti: The cost of education abroad can be around $7000 per year, which Edoofa can help bring down to about $2000 per year. Would that be affordable for the family?
22/12/23, 12:17 pm - +263 77 254 1610: Under our current circumstances, these fees are not tenable for us
22/12/23, 12:23 pm - Tushti: I see
22/12/23, 12:23 pm - Tushti: In that case, does the family wish to withdraw this application?
22/12/23, 12:24 pm - Tushti: I believe with help from all family members, and through our Earn While YOu Learn Program, the family would be able to to manage the funds
