21/12/23, 11:33 am - Tushti: Now, you mentioned you have younger siblings in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for your family to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are they facing such a situation?

21/12/23, 11:35 am - Tushti: In that case, how would the family manage the finances involved in your higher education abroad?
