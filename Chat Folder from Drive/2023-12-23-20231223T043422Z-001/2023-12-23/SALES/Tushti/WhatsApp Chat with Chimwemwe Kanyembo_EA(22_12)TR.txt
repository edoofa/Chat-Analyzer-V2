*I am Ms Tushti, Career Counsellor at Edoofa.*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online *tomorrow at 9:30 am* so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!

Please note that you shall be required to add your parent to this group tomorrow, and their participation is mandatory.
