22/12/23, 2:08 pm - Tushti: Now, you mentioned you have a younger sibling in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for the family to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are they facing such a situation?
22/12/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 368 4113: Yaa the inflation is too much 
But however both my parents are trying their best to pay their fees although it is quite difficult for them but their are still managing to send them to school
