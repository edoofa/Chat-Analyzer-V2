20/12/23, 6:01 pm - Tushti: Greetings,  dear Student!

*I am Ms Tushti, Career Counsellor at Edoofa.*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online *tomorrow at 9:30 am* so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!

Please note that you shall be required to add your parent to this group tomorrow, and their participation is mandatory.
21/12/23, 9:33 am - Tushti: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?

22/12/23, 9:28 am - Tushti: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
22/12/23, 3:50 pm - Tushti: Hi, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.

Yes, you have contacted the right person (Allan lmani)

I am very sorry Ms Tushti (Our Counsellor) for late reply.
I am  receiving your massage right now. 

I was not online for the  past five days due to lack of payments for online data (bundles)
and also network problems that l am facing.

Currently l am working on it and with the grace of the Almighty we will be in contact .

Please accept my apologies Madam.
 
I thank you.
