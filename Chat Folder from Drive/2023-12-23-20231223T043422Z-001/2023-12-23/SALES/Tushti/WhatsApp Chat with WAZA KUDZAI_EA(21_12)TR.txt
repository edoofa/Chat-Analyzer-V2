21/12/23, 3:32 pm - Tushti: Now, you mentioned you have younger siblings in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for the family to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are they facing such a situation?
21/12/23, 3:33 pm - +27 78 197 9169: No

21/12/23, 3:42 pm - Tushti: I am pleased to hear the family is supportive, may I also know the financial planning that has been done to help Kudzai realise her dream?
21/12/23, 3:59 pm - +27 78 197 9169: On that subject there is a big age gap between our first and second child. Our second child is still in primary school, so working on that we have enough financial stability for Kudzai's dream. We have money set aside to ensure that she is able to follow the career path that she chooses.
21/12/23, 4:09 pm - Tushti: Would the family be able to raise around $3000 per year for her higher studies abroad?

22/12/23, 10:06 am - Tushti: Alright
22/12/23, 10:06 am - Tushti: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
22/12/23, 10:07 am - Tushti: Now, I would like to know what course the student wishes to pursue
22/12/23, 10:09 am - +27 69 332 3519: Social work
