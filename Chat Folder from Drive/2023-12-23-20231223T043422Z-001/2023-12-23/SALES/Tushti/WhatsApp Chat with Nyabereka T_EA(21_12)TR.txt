22/12/23, 10:55 am - Tushti: Alright, let me give you a brief introduction to the Program you have applied for
22/12/23, 10:55 am - Tushti: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
22/12/23, 10:55 am - Tushti: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School.

22/12/23, 10:55 am - Tushti: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher  education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
22/12/23, 11:00 am - +263 77 757 9946: Yah that's it Mr Tushti this will also help my parents now I understand more about Edoofa scholarship

22/12/23, 11:57 am - Tushti: Thank oyu dear
22/12/23, 11:57 am - Tushti: Now, you mentioned you have younger siblings in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for the family to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are they facing such a situation?
22/12/23, 12:24 pm - +263 77 757 9946: Yah it's very difficult sometimes
22/12/23, 12:27 pm - Tushti: In that case, how would the family manage the finances involved in your higher education abroad?
22/12/23, 12:30 pm - +263 77 757 9946: Maybe it will depend on the percentage of the scholarship and I think my parents can manage it
22/12/23, 12:48 pm - Tushti: Kindly ask the parents to answer
22/12/23, 1:03 pm - +27 69 924 8743: Good day mam , I am Nigel's father  as a parent you have to hassle so that they go to school It's thesam in this case if he gets the scholarship I have to manage the requirements
22/12/23, 1:07 pm - Tushti: I see
22/12/23, 1:07 pm - Tushti: So, would the family be able to raise around $2000 per year for Nigel's tuition fee?
22/12/23, 1:13 pm - +27 69 924 8743: Yes
22/12/23, 1:13 pm - Tushti: Noted

22/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 77 757 9946: <Media omitted>
22/12/23, 2:49 pm - Tushti: Noted
22/12/23, 2:49 pm - Tushti: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
