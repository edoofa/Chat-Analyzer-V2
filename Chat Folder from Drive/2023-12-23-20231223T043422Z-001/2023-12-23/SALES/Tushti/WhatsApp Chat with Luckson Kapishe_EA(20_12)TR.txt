21/12/23, 10:36 am - +263 78 166 1430: I am going U6 next year and am doing mathematics, Food Technology and Design. Am looking forward to be a nutritionist, food specialists or anything in the line of food science because I like designing recipes and as for me food is just fascinating I feel alive when am doing food science stuff also I have always wondered how food is prepared in industries. both my parents are in the line of education as teachers with my Dad having a diploma in education while my mother has a degree in education. I have got 3 siblings with me being the only boy. My big sister is in the music industry and the next one is finishing year 2 in tertiary this year then comes the little girl who is going grade 7 as of next year. both my parents have been supporting me financially in education and they are going to continue to doing so when am in higher education abroad. My school fees per term is $120 at the school Hippo High School in Masvingo province. About myself well I believe I have got good communication skills, and punctuality is a personality of mine also creative with stuff and also good at solving problems. Well what is a human if he/she can't acknowledge his weaknesses mine being someone who is a bit slow in what I do also I get emotionally attached to things and also have trouble in saying no to people. I play chess in my extra time and sometimes read novels or research on recipes and designing some of them. Well I grew up in a family with 3 girls and we also lived with 2 of my uncles who didn't have their parents. Well I can not say something was lacking growing up because my parents always supported me in everything I do and also growing up things were a bit easy thoughsometimes school was challenging.

21/12/23, 10:48 am - Tushti: Now, you mentioned you have a younger sibling in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for your family to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are they facing such a situation?
21/12/23, 10:50 am - +263 78 166 1430: Well yeah they are but it seems they are pulling through because she hasn't been send home from school because of school fees

21/12/23, 12:25 pm - Tushti: The Board has found you eligible for BSc Nutrition and Dietetics
21/12/23, 12:25 pm - Tushti: Shall I brief you about the course?
21/12/23, 12:25 pm - +263 78 166 1430: Yes please
21/12/23, 12:30 pm - Tushti: *B.Sc. in Nutrition and Dietetics* is a 3- year long full- time undergraduate course divided over 6 semesters. It involves the study of food management, promotion of health through healthy food, and primarily focusses on the relationship between the body and food.
B.Sc. in Nutrition and Dietetics essentially involves an advanced learning in ways to enhance the quality of life and overall well-being by promoting healthy diet behaviors and exploring healthier dietary modifications.

The program consists of a comprehensive curriculum that combines the science of nutrition with a broader view of wellness, community and environment, delving into reasons for unhealthy eating behaviors and ways to rectify and improve the same.

Students interested in learning about nutritional matters and food habits, and in training in health care units such as clinics, hospitals and community nutrition in close proximity of doctors, clinicians and dieticians, are best suited for a B.Sc. in Nutrition & Dietetics.

Ideal candidates would have relevant skills such as tact, team spirit and compassion, and an inherent instinct to counsel, guide, and treat patients suffering from diet- based health issues.

Nutrition and Dietetics is fast- growing both as an academic discipline and in practical application, both in India and abroad. Successful graduates of the course interested in further studies in the discipline may pursue M.Sc., M.Phil. and Ph. D in the same subject. Those interested in professionally working in the industry and find lucrative employment opportunities in private sector clinics and hospitals, or may get self-employed.

Other areas of employment include private sector organizations such as leisure cruise companies and private nursing homes. Such graduates may also choose to become psychiatric nursing as a profession where they work with patients suffering from emotional and psychological distress caused from unhealthy diet patterns.
21/12/23, 12:31 pm - +263 78 166 1430: Okay I get it Thank you
21/12/23, 12:34 pm - +263 78 166 1430: Well with what you said about the program I feel this is what I wanted
21/12/23, 12:35 pm - Tushti: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
21/12/23, 12:35 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 80 to 100 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
21/12/23, 12:45 pm - +263 78 166 1430: well after 5 years I believe that I will have a job that will make me be able to help my parents with their finances especially sending my little sibling to a good school. I think in 5 years I will be able to start own a little restaurant which I will upgrade as time goes by. I also see my future as someone recognized in the books of food scientists and also I will be going to school to get a masters of the program like to study more and to get more knowledge. I believe with this scholarship you are to give me it will make things a bit easy for me to find jobs as I will be connected with people like you who are well recognized all over the world. Also I believe that my parents' work will be easier since I will be enrolled into a scholarship
21/12/23, 1:28 pm - Tushti: That is really great Luckson, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?
21/12/23, 1:30 pm - +263 78 166 1430: I am willing to do so it has been something i have always wanted and as we all know when one wants simething he/she gives it his or her full potential
21/12/23, 1:33 pm - Tushti: I am glad to see that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
21/12/23, 1:34 pm - +263 78 166 1430: Well because I believe that abroad I will get many job opportunities
21/12/23, 1:35 pm - Tushti: I see

21/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 166 1430: Now i understand why you recommend it and I think it is also a good choice
21/12/23, 2:54 pm - Tushti: So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
21/12/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 239 9005: Yes madam, the eldest daughter completed Production Engineering
21/12/23, 3:33 pm - Tushti: May I know which university she was enrolled in, and what was the term fee there?
21/12/23, 3:37 pm - +263 77 239 9005: Chinhoyi university of Zimbabwe,$450 fees,a monthly accommodation  of $120 and food staffs $80 monthly
21/12/23, 3:38 pm - Tushti: I see
21/12/23, 3:38 pm - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
21/12/23, 3:38 pm - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
21/12/23, 3:38 pm - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
21/12/23, 3:38 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 3:39 pm - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
21/12/23, 3:39 pm - Tushti: In simple words Lucksonwhat we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
21/12/23, 4:04 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 6:24 pm - +263 78 166 1430: No they are not
21/12/23, 6:36 pm - +263 78 166 1430: Am sorry ma'am something came up at the last moment that needed my attention and I couldn't meet your time I apologise for that
21/12/23, 6:46 pm - +263 78 166 1430: I also see it good for me to study in India because the costs per year are affordable also it makes things easy for me to find a job since you will have plans for me already
21/12/23, 6:48 pm - +263 78 166 1430: the learn while you learn program is also good since it also gives me experience in my line of work also helping my parents with the tuition fees
22/12/23, 9:30 am - Tushti: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
22/12/23, 9:34 am - +263 78 166 1430: Yes we can start
22/12/23, 9:35 am - +263 78 166 1430: I am traveling so network l might trouble me a little
22/12/23, 9:38 am - Tushti: Noted, I hope the parent would participate if you are unable to
22/12/23, 9:38 am - Tushti: Now let me brief you about the EWYL Program
22/12/23, 9:38 am - Tushti: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
22/12/23, 9:38 am - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
22/12/23, 9:39 am - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

22/12/23, 9:39 am - Tushti: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

*I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?*
22/12/23, 9:47 am - +263 78 166 1430: Yes it also helps me with the tuition fees fo the whole year which makes parents' job a lot easier when Catering for me
22/12/23, 9:47 am - +263 78 166 1430: I think its something worth it to be enrolled
22/12/23, 9:48 am - +263 77 239 9005: You are really exceptional and worth enrolling my son
22/12/23, 9:49 am - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that *you and your parent would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.*

Are you ready?
22/12/23, 9:49 am - +263 78 166 1430: Yes I am ready
22/12/23, 9:50 am - Tushti: Luckson, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
22/12/23, 9:52 am - +263 78 166 1430: The student will end up spending 1500-2150
22/12/23, 9:55 am - Tushti: Exactly Luckson, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
22/12/23, 9:55 am - Tushti: <Media omitted>
22/12/23, 9:55 am - Tushti: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
22/12/23, 9:55 am - Tushti: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
22/12/23, 9:57 am - +263 78 166 1430: Okay at least when its guaranteed it makes the parents want to enroll or pay the enrollment fee
22/12/23, 9:58 am - Tushti: Exactly! I hope the parents are online and following the conversation
22/12/23, 9:58 am - Tushti: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
22/12/23, 9:59 am - +263 78 166 1430: Okay  we wait
22/12/23, 9:59 am - Tushti: Luckson, basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
22/12/23, 9:59 am - Tushti: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
22/12/23, 9:59 am - Tushti: I would like to know from the parent whether this is understood?
22/12/23, 10:04 am - +263 77 239 9005: Understood, but I think the payment can be done early next year
22/12/23, 10:04 am - Tushti: May I know by what date the payment could be made, then?
22/12/23, 10:05 am - +263 77 239 9005: The reason being that we have fees for the start of the year to be paid now
22/12/23, 10:06 am - Tushti: I can understand
22/12/23, 10:06 am - +263 77 239 9005: First week of February
22/12/23, 10:06 am - Tushti: Can you give me an approximate date?
22/12/23, 10:07 am - +263 77 239 9005: 5 February
22/12/23, 10:08 am - Tushti: We would need to have at least a part of the payment to be made by mid January
22/12/23, 10:08 am - +263 77 239 9005: Noted
22/12/23, 10:09 am - Tushti: Would the payments be made on time?
22/12/23, 10:10 am - +263 77 239 9005: Yes madam
22/12/23, 10:10 am - Tushti: Noted
22/12/23, 10:10 am - Tushti: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
22/12/23, 10:10 am - Tushti: <Media omitted>
22/12/23, 10:11 am - Tushti: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
22/12/23, 10:11 am - Tushti: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.
22/12/23, 10:11 am - Tushti: August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.
22/12/23, 10:11 am - Tushti: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
22/12/23, 10:11 am - Tushti: With this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, would you like to ask anything?
22/12/23, 10:14 am - +263 78 166 1430: What about the visa is it in the plan l
22/12/23, 10:16 am - Tushti: Yes, our Visa officer shall be assisting you with the process
22/12/23, 10:16 am - Tushti: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready

2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India

3. Also, the financial aspect involved

4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
22/12/23, 10:16 am - Tushti: And, for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have. 

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *tomorrow at 12 pm* I would also be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application*
22/12/23, 10:16 am - Tushti: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session. I look forward to seeing your smiling face on such a picture very soon!
