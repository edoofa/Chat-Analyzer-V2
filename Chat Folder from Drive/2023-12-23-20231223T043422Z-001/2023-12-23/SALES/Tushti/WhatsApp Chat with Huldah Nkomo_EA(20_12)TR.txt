22/12/23, 9:51 am - Tushti: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher  education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
22/12/23, 9:52 am - +263 78 027 1486: Yes
22/12/23, 9:55 am - Tushti: Alright so Huldah, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction. In about a 100 words, please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself: your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background. Also do share the following details:

1. Your current educational level (O Level/ L5/ U6) and subject combination
2. The course you would like to study and why
3. What do your parents do (their profession)
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
6. Who has been financially supporting you for your Education so far
7. Who will be financially supporting your higher education abroad
8.  How much was your per-term fee in school in $?
9. Name of your school and the province in which it is located
22/12/23, 10:19 am - +263 78 027 1486: I just wrote Physics, Chemistry, Statistics and pure mathematics in my  U6 and am currently waiting for my results, I wrote mh O level and attained 9As and 2Bs. I had always dreamt of being an aerospace engineer because it has so much room for innovation and advancement. It had always just been a fantasy because it is not a programme offered in Zimbabwe and the costs of doing it abroad would be overburdening for my parents. My dad is unemployed and my mom is a credit controller , a government employee. I have a young sister in form 2, her fees is $600, I have a sister and a cousin brother in a local university. My mom fiances all these with some help from some small businesses she does with my dad. The highest education level for both my parents is attaining  diplomas in college . My per term fees was also $600 at John Tallach High School in Matabeleland North. I am an innovative girl with hopes to initiate change wherever I am, it may not necessarily be limited to aviation. I enjoy  mathematical  subjects and extra curricula activities such as debate, poetry and public speaking. I like art as far as leisure is concerned. I think I'd say my weakness is keeping my peace when I have power to correct a wrong.

22/12/23, 11:07 am - Tushti: Thank you, dear
22/12/23, 11:07 am - Tushti: Now, you mentioned you have younger siblings in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for the family to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are they facing such a situation?
22/12/23, 11:10 am - +263 78 027 1486: Yes
22/12/23, 11:52 am - Tushti: In that case, how would the family manage the finances involved in your higher education abroad?
22/12/23, 11:52 am - Tushti: Kindly ask the parent to answer
22/12/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 027 1486: They are in a meeting but they will confirm it is from the small businesses I mentioned earlier such as poultry rearing and renting out houses in addition to the salary
22/12/23, 2:50 pm - Tushti: Dear, the question is directed to the parent, they must participate in this process
22/12/23, 3:55 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
