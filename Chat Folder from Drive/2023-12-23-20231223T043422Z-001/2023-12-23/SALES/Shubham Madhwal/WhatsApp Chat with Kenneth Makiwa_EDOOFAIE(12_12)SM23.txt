12/12/23, 1:55 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program
Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!

You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.
12/12/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 389 2394: Thank you,so how do you operate?Do you fully fund or it's patial fund?
12/12/23, 3:42 pm - +263 78 246 5302: a. Partial scholarship
b. $1500 - $3000
c. EWLY program is to prepare students to be job-ready, learn and pick job skills through working experience on live projects. It also help students to earn scholarship credits to further reduce their school fees. EWYL help build technical skills like digital marketing, organization, management and soft skills. Ot also help students get online opportunities to learn employability skills

d. I believe to be accepted in Edoofa scholarship program because i believe l am a hardworking young man capable of f learning and develop new skills. I gave i strong academic record. I came up with 10 subjects, 5 As and 5 Bs, at my o level. I finished my a level this year with good course work standards. I had 3 As in my Pure Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry combination. Final Zimsec results are pending. My financial background is limiting me from achieving my goals and reach my potential. I am a quick learner and i can quickly adapt to my extracurricular activities. I believe I can work under pressure. I am a young innovative Zimbabwean man who believes he can make a change. Zimbabwe is reach in lithium and plenty of iron ores but it is still importing lithium batteries and steel

15/12/23, 11:20 am - +263 78 246 5302: Ok. I am listening.
15/12/23, 11:21 am - Shubham Madhwal: *B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering* is a 4-year undergraduate course

First thing any engineering aspirant considers while choosing a branch in Engineering is placement aspect and the course very well caters to it. A few questions which arise when admissions to engineering colleges commence include the branch in demand, highest paid engineering graduates and others such.  Apart from this palcement criteria, there are some other parameters which should be considered while choosing a discipline like- what are the research opportunities, what is scope of career growth etc.

Mechanical Engineering is the evergreen branch of engineering. Market scenario and demand of engineering graduates change every year but the demand of mechanical engineering degree will never be obsolete. Mechanical engineering graduates can find placements in almost every sector, right from construction sector to steel industry and from automobile to software.

Following are the sub disciplines that are associated with mechanical engineering:

*Production Engineering*
*Industrial Engineering*
*Manufacturing Engineering*
*Automobile Engineering*
*Artificial Intelligence*

The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized sub disciplines are discussed in this section.

*Mechanics* 

Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of forces and their effect upon matter. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and plastic) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics include Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies Dynamics the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations). Mechanics of materials, the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces Kinematics, the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion. Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms. Continuum mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than discrete) Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine

*Mechatronics and Robotics*

Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics. It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems. In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.

Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).

Robots are used extensively in industrial engineering. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.

*Thermodynamics and Thermo-science*

Thermodynamics is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a system. Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy (enthalpy) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.

Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of heat transfer, thermofluids, and energy conversion. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design engines and power plants, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat exchangers, heat sinks, radiators, refrigeration, insulation, and others.

*Design and drafting*

Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.

Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist of spray coatings, surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.

Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).
15/12/23, 11:48 am - +263 78 246 5302: I am intrigued
15/12/23, 11:59 am - Shubham Madhwal: So does this course align with your career aspirations?
15/12/23, 12:02 pm - +263 78 246 5302: Yes
15/12/23, 12:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it

15/12/23, 12:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So Kenneth, Earlier you shared with me that you are aware of the fact that the Edoofa Program Recommends India as a higher education destination for higher education, So I am sure your friend Persistance must have briefed you about the same?

15/12/23, 12:14 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So can you share your understanding about the same?
15/12/23, 12:22 pm - +263 78 246 5302: India is being recommended due to the fact that the living costs are lower compared to other countries like america. Also it has no language barrier unlike german and France. India is providing good education and it's economy is raising.
15/12/23, 12:25 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Yes please you are totally correct,

15/12/23, 12:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great so Kenneth, as you are now aware, the reason why we recommend India as a higher education destination for your higher education, So I am sure your friend Persistance must have also briefed you about the cost of Education here in India after you were aware of the Edoofa scholarship and also about the Earn While You Learn Program.

Can you comment about them in 100-200 words, So that I can get your understanding about the same and assist you accordingly? <This message was edited>
15/12/23, 1:08 pm - +263 78 246 5302: The cost of education in India after an Edoofa scholarship program is reduced to $1500-3000. This cost can be reduced through the Earn While You Learn program that allows students to earn scholarship credits to further reduce their tuition fees. Earn While You Learn program prepares students that are job-ready. The program helps students get online opportunities to learn employability skills.EWYL help build technical skills like digital marketing, organization, management and soft skills. This EWYL can give students a head start in their careers and help them to build up their resume. It can give students a sense of independence and responsibility.
15/12/23, 1:44 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great Answer Kenneth,
I can clearly see that you are aware that the cost of education in India is Around $6000-$8000, After which the cost is reduced to  $2000-$3000, you also have a great understanding of the Earn While You Learn program. 

So My next question to you would be, since there is no limit to the amount that a student can earn at the EWYL program, how many scholarship credits do you plan to earn per month so that you can assist your mother by reducing her financial burden for your education?
15/12/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 246 5302: As many as i can, sir.
15/12/23, 1:49 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted, And I really appreciate and admire your enthusiasm for the same. 
My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.
15/12/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 246 5302: Noted, sir.

15/12/23, 2:12 pm - +263 78 246 5302: The picture shows processes or steps followed inorder to be accepted in Edoofa scholarship program
15/12/23, 2:13 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 1: It’s basically the counselling process with the senior career counsellor who will help you with the information related to the Edoofa Program and help you prepare for the Eligibility Interview
15/12/23, 2:13 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 2: It is the eligibility check process where you will be interviewed by the Program Director to examine your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
15/12/23, 2:13 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 3: Once you clear the Eligibility Interview with the Program Director you will receive an Acceptance Letter from Edoofa. It is after this step that you have to pay the $350 enrollment fees Within the 7 day period of receiving the acceptance letter.
15/12/23, 2:13 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 4: This step is about the enrollment into the Edoofa Program.
15/12/23, 2:13 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.
15/12/23, 2:13 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*
15/12/23, 2:13 pm - Shubham Madhwal: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
15/12/23, 2:13 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
15/12/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 246 5302: Ok.
15/12/23, 2:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Before moving on ahead, Do you have any questions regarding the information shared with you so far?
15/12/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 246 5302: No questions.
15/12/23, 2:25 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As education is one of the crucial and important decisions of life where you have to be mentally and financially prepared. May I know who will be helping you in this process ahead?
15/12/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 246 5302: My mother
15/12/23, 2:26 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That's really good. Now as I have mentioned about the various benefits that you get once you enrol with Edoofa earlier, did I tell you that a student also saves around $1000-$1500 in College Application fees when affiliated with Edoofa?

Do you want me to explain to you further?
15/12/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 246 5302: Explain further.
15/12/23, 2:32 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Let me tell you For Admission forms, a student on average may end up paying *$1000-$1500*. For a Statement of Purpose (SOP), the cost is between *$300-$500*.
Edoofa also helps you with Visa Documentation, University Selection, and sessions, Seels Learning Centre (SLC) classes, etc, All these facilities would cost you more than *$2000* without Edoofa, but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad *for only $350*. This $350 is the Edoofa enrollment fee.
15/12/23, 2:35 pm - +263 78 246 5302: Ok.
15/12/23, 2:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please *The enrollment fee is charged to you for*:

1. Edoofa provides foster care to all its students. This is more like a family with health insurance, mentor assistance, and counsellor help. The enrollment fee includes the Application forms, SOPs, visa assistance, University sessions, etc

15/12/23, 2:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 2:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Earlier the enrollment fee was $750 but due to this pandemic, we understand the problem faced so we have initiated the relief package so now the cost is reduced to $350 and is to be paid once you are found eligible for the program and then your earn while you learn will start and other parts then you can by your scholarship credits. The enrollment fees have to be paid Within the 7-day period of receiving this letter.
15/12/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 246 5302: Alright
15/12/23, 2:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
15/12/23, 2:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 2:* Once the student's complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
15/12/23, 2:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
15/12/23, 2:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
15/12/23, 2:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

6. D) outweigh

7. B) can pollute waterways,

8. C) scientists, and

9. C) after sentence 2.

Section 3

10. 
(x - 1)/3 = k
(x - 1)/3 = 3
3 * (x - 1)/3 = 3 * 3
(x - 1) = 9
(x - 1) + 1 = 9 + 1
x = 10

Therefore, the value of x is 10. So the correct answer is D) 10.

11.
Real part: 7 + (-8) = -1
Imaginary part: 3i + 9i = 12i

So the sum is -1 + 12i. Therefore, the correct answer is A) -1 + 12i.

12. In the equation P = 108 - 23d, the value 108 represents the initial number of phones that Kathy starts with each week. This means that Kathy begins each week with 108 phones to fix. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Kathy starts each week with 108 phones to fix.

13. Given that a/b = 2, b/a = ¹/2
  4(b/a)= 4(1/2)
                 2

14. To solve the system of equations 3x + 4y = -23 and 2y - x = -19, we can use the method of substitution or elimination.
 Substituting for x
3(2y+19) + 4y = -23
10y = -80
 y = -8

Therefore x = 2(-8) +19
                  x = 3

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is (x, y) = (3, -8). The correct answer is B) (3, -8).

15.

Therefore, the point (14, 2) lies on the line. The correct answer is D) (14, 2).

16. Given the equation t^2 - 4 = 0 and t > 0, we can solve for t by taking the square root of both sides:

√(t^2 - 4) = √0
t = ±2

Since t > 0, the value of t is 2. Therefore, the correct answer is B) 2.

Section 5

Life in Rwanda 16 years after the genocide has seen significant progress in various aspects. The genocide in 1994 left the country devastated, with millions of people dead, communities shattered, and infrastructure destroyed. However, through resilience, unity, and determined efforts, Rwanda has managed to rebuild itself and create a better future for its citizens.

One of the most remarkable aspects of life in Rwanda today is the unity and reconciliation that has been fostered among its people. After the genocide, the government implemented a comprehensive plan to promote national unity and healing. The Gacaca courts were established to hold community-based trials, allowing both victims and perpetrators to come together, share their stories, and seek forgiveness. Through these efforts, Rwanda has managed to restore a sense of trust and social cohesion among its citizens.

Furthermore, Rwanda has made significant progress in terms of economic development. The government has implemented various initiatives to promote entrepreneurship, attract foreign investment, and diversify the economy. As a result, Rwanda has experienced steady economic growth over the past decade, with an average GDP growth rate of around 8% per year. This has led to a reduction in poverty rates and an improvement in living standards for many Rwandans.

Education is another area where Rwanda has made significant strides. The government has prioritized education as a means to build a knowledge-based society and create opportunities for its citizens. Today, primary school enrollment rates are close to 100%, and the government has made efforts to increase access to secondary and tertiary education as well. This focus on education has not only empowered individuals but also contributed to the overall development of the country.

In terms of infrastructure development, Rwanda has made impressive achievements. The government has invested heavily in building roads, bridges, and other transportation networks, connecting previously isolated regions and improving access to markets. Additionally, the country has embraced technology and innovation, positioning itself as a hub for tech startups and digital services. These advancements have not only improved the quality of life for Rwandans but have also attracted international attention and investment.

Despite these positive developments, challenges still remain. The scars of the genocide continue to linger, and there is a need for ongoing healing and reconciliation efforts. Furthermore, while poverty rates have decreased, income inequality remains a pressing issue. The government must continue to address these challenges to ensure a more equitable and inclusive society.

In conclusion, life in Rwanda 16 years after the genocide has witnessed remarkable progress. Through unity, reconciliation, and determined efforts, the country has managed to rebuild itself and create a better future for its citizens. Rwanda's achievements in economic development, education, and infrastructure are commendable. However, challenges persist, and the government must continue to address them to ensure a more inclusive and prosperous society. Despite the challenges, Rwanda serves as an inspiring example of resilience and the power of collective healing.


Section 6

Life often throws unexpected challenges our way, testing our resilience and determination. My journey has been no exception, as I have faced numerous obstacles while striving to achieve my goals. However, it is through these trials that I have discovered my true strength and learned valuable lessons that have shaped me into the person I am today.

From a young age, I knew that I wanted to make a difference in the world of technology. However, coming from a humble background and lacking the resources and opportunities that others may have had, I had to carve my own path. I worked tirelessly to educate myself, devouring books, online courses, and any available resources to expand my knowledge.

In the pursuit of success, failure is inevitable. Instead of letting setbacks discourage me, I viewed them as valuable learning experiences. Each failure taught me a new lesson and fueled my determination to succeed. It was through this mindset that I developed resilience and a growth mindset, understanding that failure is not the end but a stepping stone towards success.

No journey can be completed alone. Recognizing this, I actively sought out mentors who could guide and inspire me. Their wisdom and guidance proved invaluable, helping me navigate the complex world of technology. Additionally, I surrounded myself with peers who shared similar goals and aspirations, creating a supportive network that uplifted and motivated each other.

Obstacles are bound to arise on any journey, and my path was no exception. Financial constraints, self-doubt, and societal expectations often threatened to derail my progress. However, I refused to succumb to these challenges. Instead, I dug deep within myself, reminding myself of my passion and the impact I wanted to make. This unwavering commitment to my vision fueled my perseverance and propelled me forward.

As I started achieving my own goals, I realized the importance of giving back and empowering others. I became involved in initiatives that aimed to bridge the digital divide, providing access to technology and education for underprivileged communities. By sharing my knowledge and resources, I hope to inspire others and create a more inclusive and equitable future.

My journey has been a testament to the power of resilience, determination, and the belief in oneself. While the road has been challenging, it has also been incredibly rewarding. Each obstacle I overcame, each failure I experienced, and each person I helped along the way has shaped me into the person I am today. I am proud of my journey, and I am grateful for the lessons I have learned. I am confident that these experiences will continue to guide me as I strive to make a lasting impact in the world of technology.
