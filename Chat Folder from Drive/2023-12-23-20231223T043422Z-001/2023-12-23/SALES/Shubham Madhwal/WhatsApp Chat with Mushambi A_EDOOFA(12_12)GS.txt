14/12/23, 10:53 am - Gurvinder: So let me brief you about the program myself.
14/12/23, 10:53 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
14/12/23, 10:53 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
14/12/23, 10:53 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
14/12/23, 10:53 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
14/12/23, 10:57 am - +263 71 401 8032: Thank you
14/12/23, 10:59 am - +263 71 401 8032: I totally understand this is great.
14/12/23, 11:06 am - +263 71 401 8032: This is amazing.
14/12/23, 11:06 am - +263 71 401 8032: I am learning I am learning.
14/12/23, 11:07 am - +263 71 401 8032: That is exactly what I am looking forward to do.
14/12/23, 11:13 am - +263 71 401 8032: Mr Shorwi Kawadza of Hartzel is my former headmaster .
14/12/23, 12:21 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
14/12/23, 12:22 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Wynne, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
14/12/23, 1:07 pm - +263 71 401 8032: I have what it takes .
14/12/23, 1:07 pm - +263 71 401 8032: I can meet these conditions . I promise that one
14/12/23, 1:16 pm - +263 71 401 8032: Sorry for late replies network here is a problem
14/12/23, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: Now Wynne, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?

18/12/23, 8:11 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!
“Don't let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do.”
Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
18/12/23, 8:14 am - +263 71 401 8032: Morning morning sir. How are you .
18/12/23, 8:14 am - +263 71 401 8032: Thank you for the word
18/12/23, 9:32 am - Gurvinder: I am fine, how are you?
18/12/23, 9:32 am - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
18/12/23, 10:26 am - +263 71 401 8032: The reason why I want to study abroad is that it seems abroad there are better facilities of higher education than in Zimbabwe . Abroad I will be able to explore a new environment and get to understand more about new people so that I will be able to work with different races of people as soon as I am done with higher education .
18/12/23, 12:16 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
18/12/23, 12:40 pm - +263 71 401 8032: Ooh okay this bring back to my main goal in life. In my country I am going to make sure that I become part of companies ( programmes) like weather forecast  and help with all information and skills I will have by then .By that lives will be saved in cases of situations like floods , lightning strikes , heatwaves etc because they would be predicted. 

As a cardiothoreic surgeon, I will be in hospitals giving all I can so that lives will be saved .If God allows, I would like to start a surgery of mine so as to help those with heart  illnesses. In the context of developing and helping my fellow countrymen , I will be having some seasons which I will be treating for free .That will enable me achieve my goal. I am all about saving lives .
18/12/23, 1:11 pm - Gurvinder: May I know how you are going to be a Cardiothoracic surgeon if the course that has been offered to you is *BTech Aerospace Engineering*?
18/12/23, 1:16 pm - +263 71 401 8032: Mmm I was hoping to take two major courses which are 

 *Bachelor in Cardiothoreic surgery* 

 *Btech Aerospace Engineering*

According to my research on Edoofa programme through Adrian .He told me it was possible that one could take two major courses. And that's what I have been aspiring to do.
18/12/23, 1:27 pm - Gurvinder: It is unfortunate that this is not possible, Wynne.
18/12/23, 1:34 pm - +263 71 401 8032: Oooh okay okay so that means I will have to choose one from the above right
18/12/23, 1:34 pm - +263 71 401 8032: Or you will do that for me.
18/12/23, 1:54 pm - Gurvinder: I have offered you *Btech Aerospace Engineering* as if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
18/12/23, 1:57 pm - +263 71 401 8032: Mm okay okay so it's automatic I can't take medicine because I don't have Biology .I only have physics ,chemistry and mathematics <This message was edited>
18/12/23, 2:17 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
18/12/23, 2:17 pm - Gurvinder: So should we continue the session now, if your concern has been addressed?
18/12/23, 2:21 pm - +263 71 401 8032: Yes yes we can. Thank you sir for the help .I totally understand now .thank you very much
18/12/23, 2:21 pm - +263 71 401 8032: We can move sir.
18/12/23, 2:31 pm - Gurvinder: Let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
18/12/23, 2:35 pm - +263 71 401 8032: Yes yes sir. I am ready and willing to work extra hard .That one I can assure you .
18/12/23, 2:39 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
18/12/23, 2:40 pm - +263 71 401 8032: The reason why I want to study abroad is that it seems abroad there are better facilities of higher education than in Zimbabwe . Abroad I will be able to explore a new environment and get to understand more about new people so that I will be able to work with different races of people as soon as I am done with higher education .
18/12/23, 2:43 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
18/12/23, 2:46 pm - +263 71 401 8032: Ooh okay this bring back to my main goal in life. In my country I am going to make sure that I become part of companies ( programmes) like weather forecast  and help with all information and skills I will have by then .By that lives will be saved in case of situations like floods , lightning strikes , heatwaves etc because they would be predicted. In that same context of developing my country, with the help of satellites I would like to investigate and research about diseases which might be a threat and provide answers before the diseases devastate my countrymen.That my goal will he achieved since I am all about saving lives .On top of these I will develop my country by criminal investigations from the space not on the ground.That will make it easy and quick to catch the criminals. 

So that's how intend to develop my country by the skills from my higher education. <This message was edited>
18/12/23, 2:49 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Wynne, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
18/12/23, 2:56 pm - +263 71 401 8032: I do agree to that sir .However, I have been here in Zimbabwe for so long now I have a lot of experience and much knowledge of the environment so I would like a change of environment  . That way I can see and learn how they do their thing that side .That will help me to improve my way of handling things so that when I come back I will have something new and improved to use influence and develop my country .

My country need new ways and improved ones and that can't happen if we remain in here not learning anything new. We will remain stagnant that way. 
So I there by suggest that it is much better I come to India then learn and come back to Zimbabwe and influence and improvise our ways of education . <This message was edited>
18/12/23, 3:01 pm - Gurvinder: It's admirable how you're considering both your dedication to your community and the importance of gaining new experiences and knowledge in a different environment.
18/12/23, 3:02 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
18/12/23, 3:15 pm - +263 71 401 8032: Thank you thank you sir
18/12/23, 3:16 pm - +263 71 401 8032: Yes yes it is.
18/12/23, 3:16 pm - +263 71 401 8032: Why is it that Edoofa recommends India
18/12/23, 3:28 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

*Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

18/12/23, 3:32 pm - +263 71 401 8032: Woow
18/12/23, 3:33 pm - +263 71 401 8032: Woow this is amazing
18/12/23, 3:34 pm - Gurvinder: So now Wynne, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
18/12/23, 3:36 pm - +263 71 401 8032: Mm for now I don't have any question. The way you are explaining things to me. It's exceptional I love it and I totally understand. <This message was edited>
18/12/23, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
18/12/23, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
18/12/23, 3:39 pm - +263 71 401 8032: No .I am not familiar and neither any of my family members familiar.
18/12/23, 3:40 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
18/12/23, 3:40 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
18/12/23, 3:40 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
18/12/23, 3:40 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year, but as some courses are niche in nature like *Bachelor of Technology in Aerospace Engineering* itself is a course which has fewer scholarship seats, which is why for you the Annual fee after the scholarship would be between *$2700-$3700*. This cost includes:
	1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
	2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
	3. Food
	4. Accommodation
18/12/23, 3:42 pm - +263 71 401 8032: Mmm I see I see India is working very hard in helping education fee affordable and I appreciate that .
18/12/23, 3:43 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
18/12/23, 3:44 pm - +263 71 401 8032: I see I see
18/12/23, 3:46 pm - +263 71 401 8032: Okay okay sir. I await.
18/12/23, 4:10 pm - +263 71 401 8032: Yes yes sir
18/12/23, 4:10 pm - Gurvinder: Wynne, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
18/12/23, 4:13 pm - +263 71 401 8032: I totally understand sir.
18/12/23, 4:13 pm - +263 71 401 8032: Thank you thank you
18/12/23, 4:23 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
18/12/23, 4:23 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
18/12/23, 4:24 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*
_How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer!_ by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu*
_It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship_ by *Mr. Ronard Kachaje*

18/12/23, 4:24 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
18/12/23, 4:25 pm - +263 71 401 8032: This is great
18/12/23, 4:26 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Wynne, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
18/12/23, 4:27 pm - +263 71 401 8032: The extension of Edoofa is amazing
18/12/23, 4:28 pm - +263 71 401 8032: Yes yes I really think it will.
18/12/23, 4:31 pm - +263 71 401 8032: I understand sir thank you for the explanation.
18/12/23, 4:32 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.
18/12/23, 4:32 pm - +263 71 401 8032: The programme is good and helpful

18/12/23, 4:32 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
18/12/23, 4:36 pm - +263 71 401 8032: Sir this is amazing
18/12/23, 4:36 pm - +263 71 401 8032: I love it
18/12/23, 4:37 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Wynne, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
18/12/23, 4:38 pm - +263 71 401 8032: I have been looking for this sir. I am so glad to hear this.
18/12/23, 4:39 pm - +263 71 401 8032: Yes they will be. Sir
18/12/23, 4:39 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
18/12/23, 4:40 pm - +263 71 401 8032: Yes I did discuss with them
18/12/23, 4:41 pm - +263 71 401 8032: And they are so happy Edoofa came by to the rescue of high fees. We are all looking forward to receive help from Edoofa. It will be a relief to us Sir
18/12/23, 4:41 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
18/12/23, 4:41 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
18/12/23, 4:43 pm - +263 71 401 8032: I am ready sir.
18/12/23, 4:56 pm - Gurvinder: Wynne as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
18/12/23, 5:05 pm - +263 71 401 8032: A student would end up spending a lot of money sir.
18/12/23, 5:06 pm - +263 71 401 8032: That will be about $1500 minimum for five university
18/12/23, 5:18 pm - +263 71 401 8032: That will be expensive sir.
18/12/23, 5:18 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Wynne, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
18/12/23, 5:19 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 5:20 pm - +263 71 401 8032: I see I see sir
18/12/23, 5:20 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
18/12/23, 5:28 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
18/12/23, 5:32 pm - +263 71 401 8032: Ooh okay okay sir
18/12/23, 5:32 pm - +263 71 401 8032: Yes yes I think so. This is good sir
18/12/23, 5:33 pm - +263 71 401 8032: Yes yes sir my network was gone for a while but it is resolved
18/12/23, 5:33 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
18/12/23, 5:34 pm - Gurvinder: Wynne basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
18/12/23, 5:34 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
18/12/23, 5:34 pm - +263 71 401 8032: Okay okay sir
18/12/23, 5:37 pm - +263 71 401 8032: Ooh okay okay I understand sir
18/12/23, 5:38 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
18/12/23, 5:39 pm - +263 71 401 8032: No , I am not familiar of it sir
18/12/23, 5:41 pm - +263 71 401 8032: I have never heard about it before
18/12/23, 5:53 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 5:54 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Wynne, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
18/12/23, 5:54 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
18/12/23, 7:25 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 10:32 pm - +263 71 401 8032: Oooh I see. This is clear sid
18/12/23, 10:32 pm - +263 71 401 8032: *sir
18/12/23, 10:32 pm - +263 71 401 8032: Thank you sir. Good night
19/12/23, 8:33 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!
“You don't have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great.”
Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
19/12/23, 8:51 am - +263 71 401 8032: Morning morning sir how are
19/12/23, 8:51 am - +263 71 401 8032: *how are you ?
19/12/23, 9:28 am - Gurvinder: I am fine, how are you?
19/12/23, 9:28 am - +263 71 401 8032: I am fine sir thank you
19/12/23, 9:29 am - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
19/12/23, 9:29 am - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
19/12/23, 9:29 am - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
19/12/23, 9:29 am - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
19/12/23, 9:31 am - +263 71 401 8032: Sir I totally understand. Thank you thank you for the explanation
19/12/23, 9:33 am - +263 71 401 8032: I don't have any question for now
19/12/23, 9:50 am - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
19/12/23, 9:50 am - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*

Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application.
19/12/23, 9:59 am - +263 71 401 8032: Thank you thank you sir. This was amazing
19/12/23, 9:59 am - +263 71 401 8032: We are on it just now sir
19/12/23, 10:00 am - +263 71 401 8032: I see the pictures Edoofians are looking good sir
19/12/23, 10:00 am - +263 71 401 8032: Oooh okay okay I will try make sure that they will attend
19/12/23, 11:58 am - +263 77 388 8622: Thank you Mr Gurvinder and how are you and work. I have been following with great joy all the career counselling sessions you were having with Wynne. As his parent (father) am really happy with all the ongoings and hoping that my son will get a place and scholarship to study in India in the field of his interest which we are also happy of. My wife and I and all family members are happy about this move. Tomorrow like you have said we are 100% or more than ready to have some dialogues with you.
19/12/23, 12:00 pm - Gurvinder: Mr Walter, if you have followed the sessions so thoroughly and if you have read the FAQ document, I can even start the session with you right now.
19/12/23, 12:01 pm - +263 77 388 8622: Yes, l am ready even right now.
19/12/23, 12:02 pm - Gurvinder: Please I hope you have been following the session so far.
19/12/23, 12:02 pm - Gurvinder: So are there any questions that you or your family would like to ask regarding the program details?
19/12/23, 12:03 pm - +263 77 388 8622: I have been following thoroughly.
19/12/23, 12:11 pm - +263 77 388 8622: The questions are:
1. On travelling arrangements to and from India will the students sponsor themselves or they are helped.
2. Will the student or Wynne be able to get full scholarship for the course.
3. After completing the course, will be able to get a job there in India or internationally.
4. On the registration fee required, how come that they apply before writing the exams or before results are out. What will happen in case one fails to meet the required standards.
5.Will the students be given accommodation and all necessary for the upkeep of themselves.
19/12/23, 12:49 pm - Gurvinder: 1. The cost of travelling is a one-time expense that you have to bear, but let me assure you that our VISA experts will be there to guide you through the process.
2. Yes getting a full scholarship is possible but that depends on the counselling sessions, the interview, and your child's results.
3. Mr Walter in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners that provide students with good-paying jobs! You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
4. The students are able to apply before the results are out as that helps us to get them a scholarship seat early which increases their chances of getting a higher quantum of scholarship, and also if they fail to meet the requirements, then the enrollment fee is refunded.
5. The students can avail accommodation inside the University only which is affordable and the cost estimation is included in the $2700 to $3700 annual fee which I shared with you earlier.
19/12/23, 12:55 pm - +263 77 388 8622: Thank you for the clarifications. I understand.
19/12/23, 12:55 pm - Gurvinder: So @263773888622, before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that @263714018032 would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will your child be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
19/12/23, 1:28 pm - +263 77 388 8622: 1.Bachelor of Technology in Aerospace Engineering.
2.India.
3.$6000- $8000
4.$2700-$3700
5.$350 -7 days first $200 then remaining in 30 days.
6.The Earn while you learn Program or the EWYL program is backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits ( based on student's performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. The credits can be used to pay off significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
7. Yes very clear.
19/12/23, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: *@263773888622*,  I am happy to see that you understand the program details so well. I totally understand that you have work to do and So I really appreciate your cooperation and the time you are taking out to support your child.
19/12/23, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: Please note that the number of scholarship seats is limited in number, and in case *Wynne* is selected for the scholarship we expect that you are clear and aware of all the details shared during the session along with that you also obey the rules and honour the scholarship terms.
19/12/23, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: In case you do not follow these terms then *Wynne’s* entire scholarship process will go into backlog and you will only be able to apply for the scholarship after 6 months. By then the entire fee structure for the scholarship program may increase*.
19/12/23, 2:05 pm - +263 77 388 8622: Having seen the importance of the program, l decided to give this session time first then all other activities of the day follow. Also l value my child's education first because education is an investment.
19/12/23, 2:06 pm - Gurvinder: It's fantastic to see your commitment to prioritizing your child's education, Mr Walter. Education truly is an investment in their future. <This message was edited>
19/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 388 8622: We pray for Wynne to be selected for for the full scholarship. I will obey the rules and honour the scholarship terms
19/12/23, 2:08 pm - Gurvinder: Ideally, as you know, the tentative dates are:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the *26th or 27th of December 2023* for $200 and the *26th or 27th of January 2024* for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the *26th or 27th of December 2023*
19/12/23, 2:08 pm - Gurvinder: Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
19/12/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 388 8622: I promise we will follow the terms
19/12/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 388 8622: Ok, coming back to you soon, let consult my spouse (wife) since it it's a family program. At the moment am not together with my wife, she  is a bit far away at her work pla
19/12/23, 2:21 pm - Gurvinder: Please do that, but I would suggest calling her and asking so that we can fast-track Wynne's application and let him start his EWYL journey soon so that he can earn Scholarship credits till the session starts and he has collected a major part of his fees as Scholarship credits.
19/12/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 388 8622: Thank you for the advice.
So we prefer the first option that of 27 December then clear the $150 balance by 27 January 2024.
19/12/23, 2:27 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
19/12/23, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: So @263773888622 are you willing to follow the seven-day enrollment fee payment deadline protocol, In case @263714018032  gets selected into the program?
*Please answer in a Voice note format*
19/12/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 388 8622: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 2:37 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 2:38 pm - Gurvinder: And @263714018032 you will have to appear for a test, and the deadline for submitting your test responses is 07:00 PM CAT. Please ensure that you complete the test within the specified time frame and submit it accordingly.

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

Genocide is a term which defines the deliberate killing or strong destroying of a large number of people in a particular nation of ethnic group . This situation once occured in Rwanda 16 years ago and it had many negative effects and some of them are still in existence .

In the direction aftermath of genocide, two million people took refuge in the neighboring countries. This left people of Rwanda socially disrupted they lost their culture (culture erosion ) and family unity . This is a negative effect has caused a bad living to the inhabitants of Rwanda for the past years. 

However, to counter this problem the Rwandans has come on the arduous to reconciliation of their lifestyle . One of the things the government has done is to eliminate the reference to the ethnicity in identification documents . This is to eliminate division between the people of Rwanda so that they would come to be one nation and community spirit  be there fostering unit and culture. Some organizations like  Association Maestro Innocence AMI are giving hand in reconciliation of the social life. 


Talking about the economy of the nation , it is an eye sore. Due to large population lose no much economic activities like farming , mining , crafting to name a few , there was no income in the nation . This is causing a lot of horror to the people of Rwanda since there is lack of everyday commodities. We can just say Rwanda is suffering economically .

Not only economy and social life in Rwanda were affected by genocide but politics were as well affected. The president who are said managed to stop genocide have been ruling the nation since ever the genocide came to an end. This has triggered the argument that is the ruler trying to recover and heal the wounds Rwanda has suffered or he is there to exploit the horror to legitimise his ruthless authoritarian and predominantly Tutsi regime. This has led to the answer that Rwanda might be indirectly a dictatorship country and this is a negative effect of genocide. 

So overally life after genocide in Rwanda is not amazing at all. There is an accumulation of problems there though they are trying all they can to counter it.
19/12/23, 7:00 pm - +263 71 401 8032: *Section 6 Personality Test*
So my name is Wynne Mushambi son of Mr Walter Mushambi of Mutare , Gwanyamwanya Village . As weird and  bad looking of the name of the village , the village is just like it , it is an eyesore. 

From that eyesore village, originated me a person who is willing to make something in life. My dream started in a way nobody could imagine . In a brief we can just say a well wisher who helped some orphan  kids of my community was and is still my motive. 

In the course of helping those kids he got to a point he narrated his life story to the people. In the narration he mentioned he started like me living a low life in a neglected-like village with his grandparents. He had to walk a very long distance to school and sometimes get fired from school because he had not paid school fees. To counter that problem he had to do some piece jobs while going to school . From his explanation you could tell on your own that life was not a smooth flow for that person but he still made it in life .

That gave me courage and strength that I would make it. To be honest hope was not anywhere to be found that time because my parents were not yet employed and the jobs were not easy get. Getting a job was difficult ,morelike cutting an ignite rock with a nail cutter.  So I had to strive my primary school reading and studying very hard going to school not to waste any time , trying to utilize every dollar my parents had paid school fees because I knew they had not earn that money easily .

It was then when I was about to enter secondary school ( high school) my parents got lucky or I should say by God's mercy they got employed in the Ministry of education . They managed to keep sending me to school but it was hard and it is still hard for I am not the only kid in my family who need to go to school . My siblings also need that privilege so that made me consider looking for assistance in form scholarships and well-wishers like I am doing now. This will help me achieve my dream and reduce the burden of school fees from my parents. Not forgetting the motive from the well wisher , I want to be successful in life so that my kids and my circle of influence will not suffer the same problems I suffered that time .

That made me who I am now . Aiming to achieve something in life . Who knows maybe one day , I will be one person's motive as well. <This message was edited>
