I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa

Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
19/12/23, 10:07 am - +260 763785676: Good morning to you too 
Thank you for welcoming me to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session
I understood that Edoofa is a scholarship program that is merit based.It is a scholarship program whose priority is to ensure a positive reinforcement for all students,it is a 50% scholarship program but with good benefits provided by it through the Earn While You Learn Program(ewyl). The ewyl program is a project based program that helps students earn scholarship credits for themselves with the help of their mentors to help parents with finances
19/12/23, 11:41 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Deborah,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
19/12/23, 11:43 am - +260 763785676: It is a pleasure to connect with you too Mr Gurvinder and the other members 
Thank you for the information.
19/12/23, 11:44 am - +260 763785676: This message was deleted
19/12/23, 11:58 am - +260 763785676: And the privilege to be a part of this program
19/12/23, 12:33 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more about the program.
19/12/23, 12:33 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
19/12/23, 12:33 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
19/12/23, 12:33 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
19/12/23, 12:33 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
19/12/23, 12:33 pm - Gurvinder: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia*
19/12/23, 12:34 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 12:34 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 12:34 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
19/12/23, 12:43 pm - +260 763785676: I am looking forward to be a part of Edoofa so that I can become independent,take responsibility towards my higher education by myself and help my parents reduce the financial burden.I would really love to do all that for my myself and family
19/12/23, 1:12 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Deborah, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
19/12/23, 1:16 pm - +260 763785676: Yes. I think I have what it takes to meet the two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship
19/12/23, 1:28 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
19/12/23, 1:29 pm - Gurvinder: Now Deborah, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

20/12/23, 2:05 pm - Gurvinder: Did you understand the course?
20/12/23, 2:06 pm - +260 763785676: Yes and I would like to learn more.

20/12/23, 3:00 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Deborah, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
20/12/23, 3:01 pm - +260 763785676: Yes I am willing.
20/12/23, 3:10 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
20/12/23, 3:16 pm - +260 763785676: I highly believe my country is far much behind with technological advancements therefore they won’t provide me with access to these various hardware and software that’s available abroad, studying within my country will ensure that my learning process and progress is delayed which means my skills won’t develop like they should.
20/12/23, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
20/12/23, 3:27 pm - +260 97 9988111: Very good question
20/12/23, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: Please address it.
20/12/23, 3:38 pm - +260 763785676: I am still typing
20/12/23, 3:38 pm - +260 763785676: I’d help the learning system in my country by sensitising the government of my country about the learning methods and techniques used abroad by demonstrating how technology used abroad  makes work easy, faster and accessible to people of all calibres
20/12/23, 3:42 pm - +260 763785676: Done
20/12/23, 4:00 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Deborah, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
20/12/23, 4:01 pm - +260 763785676: Yes I agree
20/12/23, 4:20 pm - +260 763785676: With the hardwork and dedication plus a conducive environment provided by Edoofa, I best believe I will become a reputed personality in my country which will allow me access to contribute to the learning system in our country
20/12/23, 4:31 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
20/12/23, 4:42 pm - +260 763785676: Yes it is, I believe India has the best working personnel with the know-how required for one to achieve their full potential because of the conducive learning environment and the technological  advancements it has experienced thus far, Indians seem to very smart and their work ethic is at its level best that’s why they were able to advance more even after being under a British colony for over 200 year’s
20/12/23, 4:44 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
20/12/23, 5:07 pm - +260 763785676: Comment on the articles,I am inspired to be apart of the greats on those articles which calls for a lot of hardwork and dedication.
20/12/23, 5:09 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
20/12/23, 5:17 pm - +260 763785676: No one seems to be familiar but it must be very expensive as compared to the cost here in Zambia , tertiary education is costly here in Zambia too such that not many parents afford to pay for it.
20/12/23, 8:14 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 8:52 pm - +260 763785676: Good day too.
21/12/23, 9:43 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!
“You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem and smarter than you think.”
Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
21/12/23, 9:44 am - +260 763785676: Good morning to you too Sir.
21/12/23, 10:47 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
21/12/23, 10:47 am - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
21/12/23, 10:47 am - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
21/12/23, 10:47 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 10:47 am - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
21/12/23, 10:50 am - +260 763785676: Thank you for the information
21/12/23, 11:08 am - +260 763785676: Amazing. Edoofa is bridging a huge gap in ensuring that selected students are awarded scholarships and helping out families that cannot afford to meet high tertiary fees.
21/12/23, 12:36 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
21/12/23, 12:39 pm - +260 763785676: Yes.I will would like to know more about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth
21/12/23, 1:34 pm - Gurvinder: Deborah, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
21/12/23, 1:47 pm - +260 763785676: It would be exciting if I was part of the program.
21/12/23, 2:08 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
21/12/23, 2:08 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
21/12/23, 2:08 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*

21/12/23, 2:09 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
21/12/23, 2:17 pm - +260 763785676: Yes.i think it would really help/ benefit me in many ways looking at the teaching skills and programs used.
21/12/23, 2:26 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Deborah, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
21/12/23, 2:35 pm - +260 763785676: Okay, I understand how the earn while you learn program operates. Thank you.
21/12/23, 2:36 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

21/12/23, 2:36 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
21/12/23, 2:44 pm - +260 763785676: It is amazing to now understand that this is possible with Edoofa, I’m certain it’s very motivating to work hard and become a star performer or as you stated a proud edoodian.
21/12/23, 2:45 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Deborah, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
21/12/23, 2:49 pm - +260 763785676: I believe so too.
21/12/23, 2:50 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
21/12/23, 2:57 pm - +260 763785676: We did discuss, but not in depth.
21/12/23, 2:58 pm - +260 763785676: We’re still discussing building on this vital information you’re giving us.
21/12/23, 3:01 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
21/12/23, 3:02 pm - +260 763785676: Yes.i am ready.
21/12/23, 3:02 pm - Gurvinder: Deborah as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
21/12/23, 3:07 pm - +260 763785676: $ 2250.Would be the cost of applying to about 5 universities
21/12/23, 3:08 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Deborah, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
21/12/23, 3:08 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 3:11 pm - +260 97 9988111: What a rare privilege. This is attainable and very reasonable.
21/12/23, 3:14 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
21/12/23, 3:24 pm - +260 763785676: I think it’s a great way to make sure the admission process is not disturbed,it’s amazing.
21/12/23, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
21/12/23, 3:25 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).


Phase 3: Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.


The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.

However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
21/12/23, 3:36 pm - +260 97 9988111: Edoofa, very considerate indeed👏🏾
21/12/23, 3:38 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
21/12/23, 3:48 pm - +260 763785676: I am not familiar with it. Please help me understand.
21/12/23, 3:54 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 3:54 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Deborah, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zambia itself.
21/12/23, 3:54 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
21/12/23, 3:56 pm - +260 763785676: Yes thank you for explaining everything.
21/12/23, 3:59 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
21/12/23, 3:59 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
21/12/23, 3:59 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
21/12/23, 3:59 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
21/12/23, 4:02 pm - +260 763785676: No.the explanation is enough
21/12/23, 4:03 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
21/12/23, 4:03 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
21/12/23, 4:03 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

SECTION 5
In the afternoon of the tragic genocide that occurred in Rwanda in 1994, the country has undergone significant transformations showcasing resilience, reconciliation, and a commitment to rebuilding. The years following the genocide have witnessed a remarkable journey towards healing and progress, shaping a new narrative for Rwanda.

One of the key aspects of post-genocide Rwanda is the emphasis on unity and reconciliation. The government, under the leadership of President Paul Kagame, initiated measures to foster a sense of national belonging and shared identity. Efforts such as the Gacaca courts, which aimed at community-based justice, played a crucial role in addressing the overwhelming number of cases resulting from the genocide. These mechanisms, though imperfect, provided a platform for truth-telling, accountability, and the restoration of relationships within communities.

Economically, Rwanda has made significant strides. The government has implemented policies aimed at promoting economic development and reducing poverty. The focus on sectors such as agriculture, tourism, and information technology has led to substantial economic growth. The capital city, Kigali, stands as a testament to this progress with its modern infrastructure and a burgeoning tech sector. Foreign investments and partnerships have contributed to Rwanda's economic rejuvenation, positioning it as one of the fastest-growing economies in the region.

Education and healthcare have also seen positive changes in post-genocide Rwanda. Efforts to rebuild the education system and promote inclusivity have resulted in increased literacy rates. The emphasis on education as a tool for reconciliation and nation-building has paved the way for a new generation of Rwandas who are determined to break the cycle of violence and promote unity.

The healthcare sector has witnessed improvements, with initiatives aimed at providing accessible and quality healthcare services to all citizens. The government's commitment to rebuilding a healthy nation is evident in the successful implementation of health insurance schemes, community health programs, and disease prevention measures.

These efforts have contributed to improved life expectancy and overall well-being. 

While Rwanda has made commendable progress, challenges persist. The psychological scars of the genocide continue to affect individuals and communities. The process of healing and reconciliation is ongoing, requiring sustained efforts in mental health support and trauma counselling. Additionally, questions surrounding political freedoms and human rights have been raised, promoting discussions about the balance between stability and democratic values.

Rwanda's experience also offers valuable lessons for the international community. The importance of addressing root causes of conflict, promoting justice, and supporting post-conflict reconstruction cannot be overstated. The resilience of the Rwandan people serves as an inspiration for other nations grappling with the aftermath of violence and strife.

In conclusion, life in Rwanda in the years following the genocide reflects a story of remarkable resilience and progress. The country has overcome immense challenges, focusing on unity, reconciliation, and economic development. While acknowledging the strides made, it is essential to remain vigilant in addressing ongoing challenges and fostering a sustainable path towards a brighter future for Rwanda and its people.

SECTION 6
During my secondary life I never thought of studying in another country because I thought it was too expensive. Then when I wrote my grade nine exam I heard someone from my school went to study in another county which sounded delightful.
And ever since that day, I have been imaging myself flying abroad to another county to study high education and start working to make money. I choose my course of study in grad11 which is Bachelor of Computer Application. I once went for a computer tour. In the process they introduced us to some computer technicians, they showed us how they do there job.i admired there job and informed my mother on the course I would like to study.
When I finished my exams I heard a former Njase girl who is Francine Chilabi went to study in India with a scholarship. That led me to confidence to register to Edoofa. After doing some research on universities in Zambia, it appears to be that most schools are dropping academically.
After going through a counselling session with Edoofa I was inspired to go there. I want to become a successful person in life and help my parents with financial businesses including my young siblings education. 
Looking at the information I was given by Edoofa it can be interesting to study there and interact with different people from different countries.
Hope my story can also inspire someone out there if I will be chosen for the Edoofa program.
