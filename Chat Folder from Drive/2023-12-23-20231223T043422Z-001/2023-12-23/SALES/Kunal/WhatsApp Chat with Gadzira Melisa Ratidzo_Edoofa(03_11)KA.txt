I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
08/11/23, 3:35 pm - +263 78 694 1822: Yes I am
08/11/23, 3:37 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
08/11/23, 3:37 pm - Kunal: Based on my evaluations, considering your subjects, interests and passion, you are eligible to pursue

08/11/23, 3:50 pm - +263 78 694 1822: Yes please
08/11/23, 4:04 pm - Kunal: *Bachelor in Psychology* is a 3-year undergraduate course.

*What is a Bachelor in Psychology course?*

In Bachelor in Psychology, students learn mainly about the processing of the human mind and human behaviour. They study how humans behave differently in different circumstances while dealing with different sets of people. On the basis of this, various conclusions are drawn.

 *What is it about?*

Psychology, in simple terms, is the study of human mind and human behavior. A student of psychology has to study how a human mind works in different situations, how it develops perception, what are the various circumstances and how they affect the development of human behavior. Although psychology is introduced at school level in India, it is only at the college level when one learns the basic theories and applications related to Psychology and Psychoanalysis. Psychology courses at the undergraduate level are generally application based and prepare students for entry level jobs in related fields.

BA Psychology is ideal for students who have a leaning towards Arts and Social Sciences and are willing to take up an in-depth study of psychology.

*Career Prospects*

What can you do with a BA degree in Psychology?

The graduates of BA Psychology have a lot of opportunities ahead, both in academics and in the job sector.

09/11/23, 7:38 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
09/11/23, 7:38 pm - Kunal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
09/11/23, 7:38 pm - Kunal: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
09/11/23, 8:48 pm - Kunal: Let us connect at *7:30 am CAT Tomorrow to resume your session *(In case you have any challenges, please let me know the time you will be available, and we will schedule accordingly)*

Please note that your participation and activeness is an important parameter of evaluation. 

*In case the student is having lessons, the parents can also take part in the session*

Stay Blessed!
10/11/23, 7:40 am - Kunal: Good morning to you all
I hope you all are doing fine

Shall we proceed with our session?
10/11/23, 8:04 am - +263 78 694 1822: Morning how are you doing today
10/11/23, 8:04 am - +263 78 694 1822: Yes
10/11/23, 8:18 am - Kunal: It is good to hear from you

I am doing fine, thank you
10/11/23, 8:18 am - Kunal: Please address the same and let us continue
10/11/23, 8:27 am - +263 78 694 1822: I'm a bit confused ,but I think I will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn program
10/11/23, 8:33 am - Kunal: Indeed
If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
10/11/23, 9:37 am - +263 78 694 1822: Alright I now understand
10/11/23, 9:46 am - Kunal: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
10/11/23, 9:46 am - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
10/11/23, 9:46 am - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
10/11/23, 9:46 am - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different.
Let me know which point out of 4 you like the most
10/11/23, 10:47 am - Kunal: Are we connected?
10/11/23, 10:56 am - +263 78 694 1822: Yes we are
10/11/23, 10:56 am - +263 78 694 1822: Was going through what you just sent me
10/11/23, 11:04 am - +263 78 694 1822: Point number 2
10/11/23, 11:05 am - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and maximum exposures
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

10/11/23, 11:05 am - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
10/11/23, 11:09 am - +263 78 694 1822: Okay l understand
10/11/23, 11:11 am - +263 78 694 1822: I hope to get a full scholarship ,but I think my mom will be financially stable to pay the remaining fee
10/11/23, 11:12 am - Kunal: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
10/11/23, 11:14 am - +263 78 694 1822: There are happy about it that l will get access to better tertiary education which will bring a better change in my life <This message was edited>
10/11/23, 11:14 am - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at even a greater pace, as you will be transformed to a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family thereby yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle free life to your parents.
10/11/23, 11:15 am - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
10/11/23, 11:19 am - +263 78 694 1822: Oooh thank you
10/11/23, 11:19 am - Kunal: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
10/11/23, 11:19 am - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
10/11/23, 11:19 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
10/11/23, 11:21 am - +263 78 694 1822: Ooh that's affordable
10/11/23, 11:21 am - Kunal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
10/11/23, 11:21 am - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
The Foster and Care throughout your course
10/11/23, 11:21 am - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
10/11/23, 11:26 am - +263 78 694 1822: This is good news
10/11/23, 11:26 am - Kunal: Indeed it is
10/11/23, 11:26 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
10/11/23, 11:29 am - +263 78 694 1822: I think we discussed up to stage 4
10/11/23, 11:29 am - Kunal: That is right.We had very well covered till the Acceptance Letter and Enrollment formalities which is in stage 4.Even though we had mentioned stages 5 and 6 briefly we are left with some more information from the last two stages
So shall I explain it to you
10/11/23, 11:30 am - +263 78 694 1822: Yes
10/11/23, 11:31 am - Kunal: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
10/11/23, 11:31 am - Kunal: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
10/11/23, 11:31 am - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
10/11/23, 11:33 am - +263 78 694 1822: Yes I'm now clear with the process
10/11/23, 11:48 am - Kunal: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
10/11/23, 11:49 am - Kunal: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*
