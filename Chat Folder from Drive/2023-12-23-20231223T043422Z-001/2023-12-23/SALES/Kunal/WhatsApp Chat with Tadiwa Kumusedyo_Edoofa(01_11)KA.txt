01/11/23, 12:22 pm - Kunal: Let me help you understand more about the program
01/11/23, 12:22 pm - Kunal: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
01/11/23, 12:22 pm - Kunal: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than *200 schools in Zimbabwe*. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with *St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others*. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few *St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.

02/11/23, 1:20 pm - +263 71 649 4467: OK thank you Mr
02/11/23, 3:40 pm - +263 71 649 4467: OK
02/11/23, 3:42 pm - Kunal: Welcome, Tatenda
02/11/23, 5:19 pm - +263 78 807 0093 was added
02/11/23, 3:42 pm - +263 78 807 0093: Thank yu sir
02/11/23, 3:44 pm - Kunal: Tatenda, you can also go through the aspects of the program from this group itself
02/11/23, 3:46 pm - +263 71 649 4467: Olk l will go thru it
02/11/23, 4:09 pm - Kunal: I welcome Tatenda and family
We are going to proceed ahead in the same group for the application of Tatenda and Tadiwa
02/11/23, 4:09 pm - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
02/11/23, 4:11 pm - +263 78 807 0093: Olk so wen am l supposed to present that information
02/11/23, 4:11 pm - Kunal: Let me guide ahead
02/11/23, 4:11 pm - Kunal: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
02/11/23, 4:11 pm - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
02/11/23, 4:11 pm - +263 78 807 0093: Thank yu Mr Kunal we can proceed
02/11/23, 4:11 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
02/11/23, 4:12 pm - +263 78 807 0093: Olk l understand
02/11/23, 4:13 pm - Kunal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
02/11/23, 4:13 pm - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
The Foster and Care throughout your course
02/11/23, 4:13 pm - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
02/11/23, 4:17 pm - +263 71 649 4467: I understand
02/11/23, 4:17 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
02/11/23, 4:32 pm - Kunal: I am expecting the response
02/11/23, 5:34 pm - +263 77 374 4493, +263 77 571 8410 and +263 78 852 0800 were added
02/11/23, 5:50 pm - +263 78 852 0800: the fon battery died
02/11/23, 6:18 pm - Kunal: I would suggest you to address this and let us finish the session
02/11/23, 9:35 pm - +263 71 649 4467: Stage 1
02/11/23, 9:48 pm - +263 78 807 0093: We have fully addressed stage 1
03/11/23, 5:13 am - Kunal: Good morning, everyone
03/11/23, 5:13 am - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
03/11/23, 7:44 am - +263 71 649 4467: Yes please
03/11/23, 12:25 pm - Kunal: I am contented with your responses and performance so far as a result, let me promote your application to Stage 2 of the Edoofa Cycle. Congratulations!!👏🏼👏🏼.

Your next session is scheduled at *1:00 pm CAT Tomorrow (04/11/2023), and Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa* will evaluate your application and guide you through the most important *Eligibility Check* after addressing your questions. 

Make sure to be available on time after having a detailed discussion with your family and *it is strongly recommended for parents/guardians of the applicant to be online for the next session as higher education is a family decision.*

04/11/23, 1:59 pm - +263 71 649 4467: Not that much sir
04/11/23, 2:06 pm - Austin: Tadiwa, please refer this
04/11/23, 2:07 pm - +263 71 649 4467: Can you resend sir I just changed my WhatsApp so I can show them
04/11/23, 2:14 pm - Austin: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
04/11/23, 2:14 pm - Austin: <Media omitted>
04/11/23, 2:15 pm - +263 71 649 4467: Thank you sir
04/11/23, 2:20 pm - Austin: <Media omitted>
04/11/23, 2:21 pm - Austin: Please go through the conversations and let me know once done
04/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 71 649 4467: Am done sir
04/11/23, 3:21 pm - Austin: So, can you tell me

1. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

2. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

3. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?
04/11/23, 3:29 pm - +263 71 649 4467: 1:$6000_$8000 per year
2:$2000 
3:$500_$1000 and payable in a few weeks
04/11/23, 3:34 pm - Austin: 3) *Enrollment fee*
For all the services and assistance including Applications to Universities, Statement of Purpose, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection and sessions, Earn While you Learn program and training, etc all you have is $350 which can either be paid in two phases($200 in 7 days and remaining within the next 30 days) or together
04/11/23, 3:46 pm - +263 71 649 4467: Ok sir thank you
04/11/23, 3:53 pm - Austin: You are welcome, Tadiwa!
04/11/23, 3:54 pm - Austin: *Registration Fee*
The registration fee is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from the University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. 

*The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived from the cost of education.*
 
For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $1800 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $1800-600= $1200
04/11/23, 3:55 pm - +263 78 807 0093: 1:$6000_$8000 per year
