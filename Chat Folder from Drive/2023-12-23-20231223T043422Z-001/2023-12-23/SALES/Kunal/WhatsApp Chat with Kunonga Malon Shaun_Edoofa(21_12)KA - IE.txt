I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it

22/12/23, 11:09 am - Kunal: Malon, I was referring about this course without the specific focus on Economics, provides a broader foundation in business and commerce. This program equips you with a versatile skill set applicable across various sectors, offering a comprehensive understanding of business principles, management, and finance.
22/12/23, 11:24 am - +263 77 703 3674: Mr Kunal sir ,some of the degrees you are opting that l take are of little significance here in Zimbabwe,some of them are valuable there in India but not in Zimbabwe,due to the differnces in our economies .Both India and Zimbabwe are developing nations but at different levels of growth and development making some degrees useful in another country and not of much importance in another.With such a degree l cant get employment here in Zimbabwe but if l was in India l would  get employment .That's why l asked for a degree in agricultural economics, l can get  both  employment and be an entrepreneur. In short ,may you give me either bachelor of science Honors in  agricultural economics, bachelor of commerce Honors  in economics or bachelor of science honors in agribusiness .If you can not ,it is ok.I thank you for your time and consideration.
