*I am Ms.Harmehak, Career Counselor at Edoofa.*

I am here to evaluate Vanessa Shenjere's application for the Edoofa Program. 

Shall we start?
20/12/23, 9:40 am - +263 78 199 1863: Hello Ms Harmehak
Yes we can start
20/12/23, 9:43 am - Harmehak: It is a pleasure to connect with you today, 

You can address me as *Ms. Harmehak and we do have with us, Mr. Sahil who is the Senior Career Counselor and Mr. Jyotishman who is the Head of Admissions* and will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
20/12/23, 9:44 am - +263 78 199 1863: Alright
Thank you
20/12/23, 9:44 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Vanessa, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
20/12/23, 9:57 am - +263 78 199 1863: Alright

I am a 19 year old girl.  I live with my mother and I have 2 siblings. My father is a heavy-machinery assessor, he basically graduated college. My mother is an entrepreneur. My oldest brother is an electrical engineer and my older sister is in university studying business marketing and risk management.
I obtained 8 A's, 3 B's and a distinction in my final Ordinary level exams. I went on to study Maths, Physics and Chemistry Alevel because I wanted to pursue either engineering or medicine. Educationwise, my strengths are in mathematics and my weaknesses in Chemistry, I found chemistry challenging. I was the previous headgirl of the school and I initiated several projects at the school such as the student council which is basically a voice for the students, I was the founder of the girl child protection programme and several clubs such as the LEOS club.
My parents are divorced so I grew up with my mother. I do visit my father from time to time and he is based in South Africa.
20/12/23, 10:07 am - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Vanessa, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!

I can see despite their personal relationship, your parents are leading a family that greatly values education too!
20/12/23, 10:11 am - +263 78 199 1863: Thank you
20/12/23, 10:11 am - Harmehak: Well Vanessa now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
20/12/23, 10:13 am - +263 78 199 1863: Yes I do
As much as I love my country, I think it's backward in terms of infrastructure and technology and therefore this results in an education system that's short-changed
20/12/23, 10:19 am - Harmehak: You see, Vanessa, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
20/12/23, 10:21 am - +263 78 199 1863: Yes Ms Harmehak
The economy is in a bad state
20/12/23, 10:22 am - Harmehak: Yes, however I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future, Vanessa!

Would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
20/12/23, 10:23 am - +263 78 199 1863: I have never lived alone or away from family so it will be a new experience for me. However, I am good at adjusting well to new environments so hopefully I'll find my way
20/12/23, 10:25 am - Harmehak: Vanessa, I am delighted to see your dedication along with your commitment to move out of your comfort zone!

Now I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially? <This message was edited>
20/12/23, 10:28 am - +263 78 199 1863: Yes they are aware and supportive of it
20/12/23, 10:34 am - Harmehak: I appreciate please!
20/12/23, 10:34 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
20/12/23, 10:37 am - +263 78 199 1863: Alright
Understood
20/12/23, 10:45 am - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Engineering ?
20/12/23, 10:47 am - +263 78 199 1863: I obtained 8 A's 3 B's and a distinction
I'll have to send you a picture of my results. I don't have it right now
I want to study engineering because I'm into mathematics a lot so I want to do a job that keeps me working on math problems and solving them
20/12/23, 10:48 am - Harmehak: Do share the picture once you have the access to it.
20/12/23, 10:49 am - +263 78 199 1863: Alright I will
20/12/23, 10:49 am - Harmehak: Well that's good,

Vanessa, would you agree with me that engineering is a vast field?
20/12/23, 10:49 am - +263 78 199 1863: I would and I will admit that I need help with choosing which type of engineering I need to do exactly
20/12/23, 11:13 am - Harmehak: Sure Vanessa!

So which fields are you inclined towards currently?
20/12/23, 11:18 am - +263 78 199 1863: Biomedical engineering and electrical
20/12/23, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: Alright please,

So what motivates you to study the same, Vanessa?
20/12/23, 12:26 pm - +263 78 199 1863: May you please rephrase your question
20/12/23, 12:47 pm - Harmehak: What motivates you to study in the field of Biomedical engineering or Electrical Engineering?
20/12/23, 12:54 pm - +263 78 199 1863: It's mostly because of my love of mathematics and as a female I have the urge to work in a male dominated career so I can inspire other girls
20/12/23, 1:10 pm - Harmehak: Oh alright please,

Given your choices, I shall suggest Electrical engineering considering your fondness for Mathematics,

What is your take on the same?
20/12/23, 1:34 pm - +263 78 199 1863: That's fine thank you
20/12/23, 2:19 pm - Harmehak: Shall I brief you about the same?
20/12/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 199 1863: Yes please

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
20/12/23, 3:56 pm - +263 78 199 1863: Mainly because of a backward education system, due to lack of technology and infrastructure. Also because of the lack of jobs due to a receding economy
20/12/23, 4:08 pm - Harmehak: I can understand, Vanessa.
20/12/23, 4:09 pm - Harmehak: However I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future, Vanessa.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
20/12/23, 4:23 pm - Harmehak: Please!
20/12/23, 4:42 pm - +263 78 199 1863: I researched that India ranks well regarding the best education systems in the world and that the current Indian educational system is more accessible, adaptable and practical as a result of  innovation, research and technology
20/12/23, 4:51 pm - Harmehak: Very correct!

Thank you for the information
20/12/23, 5:08 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
20/12/23, 5:17 pm - +263 78 199 1863: No we're not aware
20/12/23, 5:19 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
20/12/23, 5:19 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
20/12/23, 5:19 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
20/12/23, 5:19 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
20/12/23, 5:19 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 5:29 pm - +263 78 199 1863: Alright
So the 2000 to 3000 after the Edooda scholarship is for 50% off?
20/12/23, 5:33 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
20/12/23, 5:36 pm - +263 78 199 1863: That's a considerate deduction
Understood
20/12/23, 5:37 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate
20/12/23, 5:37 pm - Harmehak: Vanessa, from Mr Piyush's experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
20/12/23, 5:38 pm - +263 78 199 1863: I agree
20/12/23, 5:40 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Vanessa?
20/12/23, 5:46 pm - +263 78 199 1863: Yes
20/12/23, 5:47 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
20/12/23, 5:47 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
20/12/23, 5:47 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
20/12/23, 5:47 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

Have you been following the discussion please?
20/12/23, 6:46 pm - Harmehak: Are we connected, Vanessa?
20/12/23, 7:13 pm - Harmehak: I am expecting to hear from you Vanessa, so that we proceed ahead and conclude the discussion!

I believe you are following the discussion!

May I know the reason behind delayed in response and not getting back?
20/12/23, 7:15 pm - +263 78 199 1863: My apologies Ms Harmehak
I'm having network problems
20/12/23, 7:16 pm - +263 78 199 1863: I went through the Earn While You Learn Program and it sounds fun and it sounds like it brings out students' creative side. I love it
20/12/23, 7:16 pm - Harmehak: I do understand!

Are you now in a stable network?
20/12/23, 7:17 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!
20/12/23, 7:17 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
20/12/23, 7:17 pm - +263 78 199 1863: Pardon my father, his travelling but I'm sure he will go through everything soon
20/12/23, 7:18 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please,

I do understand.
20/12/23, 7:18 pm - +263 78 199 1863: Alright
Understood
20/12/23, 7:18 pm - +263 78 199 1863: Yes ma'am
20/12/23, 7:18 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

20/12/23, 7:24 pm - +263 78 199 1863: Yes that really is helpful
Thank you for the insight
20/12/23, 7:24 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome
20/12/23, 7:24 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
20/12/23, 7:27 pm - +263 78 199 1863: Yes ma'am
20/12/23, 7:28 pm - Harmehak: Vanessa, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
20/12/23, 7:28 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
20/12/23, 7:29 pm - +263 78 199 1863: Around $1500- $2250
20/12/23, 7:31 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
20/12/23, 7:31 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 7:31 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
20/12/23, 7:31 pm - Harmehak: You see, Vanessa, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
20/12/23, 7:32 pm - +263 78 199 1863: That sounds fair
20/12/23, 7:33 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
20/12/23, 7:33 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
20/12/23, 7:33 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
20/12/23, 7:36 pm - +263 78 199 1863: Alright
20/12/23, 7:37 pm - +263 78 199 1863: Alright
20/12/23, 7:41 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
20/12/23, 7:42 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
20/12/23, 7:42 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 7:42 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
20/12/23, 7:42 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
20/12/23, 7:45 pm - +263 78 199 1863: Yes understood

I have a question
20/12/23, 7:46 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
20/12/23, 7:46 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
20/12/23, 7:46 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
20/12/23, 7:46 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 7:49 pm - +263 78 199 1863: Alright


So the 1st $350 is specifically for Edoofa?


Then for the specific university that I get into I'll have to pay around $500-$1000

Confirm if I'm correct please
20/12/23, 7:52 pm - Harmehak: *The $350, enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.*

The $500-1000 is registration fee which is waived of from your First Year's Fee and is not a separate fee, Vanessa!
20/12/23, 7:53 pm - +263 78 199 1863: Alright understood
20/12/23, 7:54 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
20/12/23, 7:54 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
20/12/23, 7:54 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 8:00 pm - +263 78 199 1863: Alright
Thank you
20/12/23, 8:01 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
20/12/23, 8:01 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
20/12/23, 8:01 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.
