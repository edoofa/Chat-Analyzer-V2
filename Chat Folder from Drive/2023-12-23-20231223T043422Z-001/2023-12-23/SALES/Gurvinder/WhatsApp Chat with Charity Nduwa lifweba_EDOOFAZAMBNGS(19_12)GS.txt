19/12/23, 9:42 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Charity!

I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa

Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
19/12/23, 10:33 am - +260 97 7693941: Hello! This is charity's mum. Unfortunately  am not home with her at the moment, am in another town!
19/12/23, 11:54 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Mrs Mulonda,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
19/12/23, 11:54 am - Gurvinder: May I know when will you be back home?
19/12/23, 12:54 pm - +260 97 7693941: Am back home by 2nd January  2024.
19/12/23, 1:13 pm - Gurvinder: So Let us continue the counselling session with you itself.
19/12/23, 1:13 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program?
19/12/23, 2:01 pm - +260 97 7693941: Well!  I believe its an organisation  that is helping  students  in securing  scholarships and sponsorship  in different  colleges/universities  in india
19/12/23, 2:13 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program clearly.
19/12/23, 2:13 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
19/12/23, 2:13 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
19/12/23, 2:13 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
19/12/23, 2:14 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
19/12/23, 2:14 pm - Gurvinder: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia*

19/12/23, 2:14 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 2:14 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
19/12/23, 8:49 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
20/12/23, 8:32 am - +260 97 7693941: So sorry  about  that. I was in a meeting. I've read through  and ready to hear more.
20/12/23, 8:37 am - +260 97 7693941: I've noted one program  that is focusing  on " Earn while you learn'  program.   Does it mean while learning  a student  can be working a job??
20/12/23, 8:44 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!
“There are no shortcuts to any place worth going.”
Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
20/12/23, 9:11 am - +260 97 7693941: Goodmorning!
20/12/23, 9:35 am - Gurvinder: Please address this.
20/12/23, 9:58 am - +260 97 7693941: Indeed.  As the mother  to charity,  I would  certainly  like  this  for my daughter  .
20/12/23, 10:33 am - +260 97 7693941: It would  really help  us financially considering  that my husband  has be a kidney  patient  for some time now and it has affected  our financial  stability.
20/12/23, 11:24 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Mrs Mulonda, as we start your daughter's counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
20/12/23, 12:06 pm - +260 97 7693941: Well! I would  have loved  my daughter  to get the scholarship but  after  reading this  I don't seem  to qualify because  I've  not been  consistent  on the counselling  stage due to circumstances  beyond  my control  and the other  reason  is that am not home with my family for them to be present throughout  the counseling and eligibility process.  So with this in mind, I don't know how Edoofa could be of help in this kind of  a scenario. <This message was edited>
20/12/23, 12:28 pm - Gurvinder: Please Mrs Mulonda, I just want 2-3 hours of your time in a day, I hope you can do that?
20/12/23, 12:39 pm - +260 97 7693941: Yes please I can do that.
20/12/23, 1:10 pm - Gurvinder: Now Mrs Mulonda, I would like to know Charity better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about her, her career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Her highest education level?
2. The course she would like to study?
3. What do you parents do?
4. What is the parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting her for her Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting her financially for her higher education abroad?
7. Does she have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?


Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
20/12/23, 2:27 pm - +260 97 7693941: About Charity! Her full names  are Charity  Nduwa Lifweba.  She was born  on the 16th of April  2006. She is the third born in a family  of three girls  and she is  the last born. Her highest level  of education  is grade twelve  and that's senior secondary  school  level  here in zambia.  She wrote her grade twelve  exams  in November  this year  2023 and she is waiting  for results  which will  be coming  out anytime  soon and among the courses   she would love to study are architecture, law  and pharmacy. The father is an accountant and me the mother  am in to small scale farming.  As far as education  is concerned, I went up to college. The dad went up to university  level  and soon to retire.

20/12/23, 2:39 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to know about Charity.
20/12/23, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during her introduction you mentioned she would like to study architecture, law  and pharmacy, could you please share what motivates her behind these fields of study?
20/12/23, 3:05 pm - +260 97 7693941: For  architecture, she said  she  loves  drawing and coming up with designs  of different  shapes,  for law it's because  she enjoys  watching  court  proceedings on TV shows and that how she  thinks of doing law one day. For pharmacy  it's  because  her aunty is a pharmacist  that's  where she gets the inspiration.
20/12/23, 3:13 pm - Gurvinder: It's wonderful to hear about your daughter's diverse interests in architecture, law, and pharmacy. Her motivations in each field seem rooted in her genuine passion and exposure to various aspects of these professions.
20/12/23, 3:13 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share your Grade 10 and Grade 12 results for evaluation?
20/12/23, 3:25 pm - +260 97 7693941: For grade twelve (12). The results  are not yet  out. For grade 9-10 results,  like I said  earlier, am not home meaning  I can't access  them right  away,  but I've managed to call home so that they scan and send  them over, then I too can send then over to you.
20/12/23, 3:32 pm - Gurvinder: Please, you can send her Grade 12 term results.
20/12/23, 3:35 pm - +260 97 7693941: Oh ok. Will  ask them to send those too since am not home.
20/12/23, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
20/12/23, 3:40 pm - Gurvinder: Please you can also add someone from home so that it could be easier.
20/12/23, 3:40 pm - Gurvinder: Is Charity on whatsapp?
20/12/23, 4:13 pm - +260 97 7693941: I can add someone from home yes,  but the problem  will be network  ! We leave  in an area which  has very poor mobile network  services and to get a message  over is quite  a struggle. So having  said this I think we end the chat here cause I think I won't manage to get all the necessary  information  that you might need.  Thankyou for your time.
