20/12/23, 12:47 pm - Gurvinder: Good Afternoon Member, Mr Ncube!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
20/12/23, 12:49 pm - +263 77 138 2796: Good day Mr Singh....its Member you are correct.
Thank you for contacting
20/12/23, 1:13 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Member,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
20/12/23, 1:16 pm - +263 77 138 2796: Thank you Mr Gurvinder, its also awesome to be introduced to the whole team
20/12/23, 1:38 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Member, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Mbalenhle, is that correct?
20/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 138 2796: Yes she is the one who introduced it to me
20/12/23, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Mbalenhle, also do tell me whether you learnt about Mbalenhle’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
20/12/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 138 2796: Ok, about journey and experience she did not disclose that to me..

I learnt that Edoofar program is a scholarship initiated by Anhad Edutrain solutions, i was further told that it covers 50-100% tutution fees. I also learnt that the program works closely with local ambassadors for more clarity....Furthermore, l was l also advised about the program of Earn While You Learn whereby a student will be enhancing his or her skills on the field of study
20/12/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 138 2796: Further on the issue of EWYL program, l also learnt that it helps students earn credits to fund their higher education
20/12/23, 2:31 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more about the program.
20/12/23, 2:31 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
20/12/23, 2:31 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
20/12/23, 2:31 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
20/12/23, 2:31 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
20/12/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 138 2796: Thank you so much very clear
20/12/23, 2:44 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Member, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
20/12/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 138 2796: Thank you...yes l think l have what it takes to meet these 2 significant metrics
20/12/23, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: Now Member, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

22/12/23, 9:41 am - Gurvinder: Member, I wanted to discuss an exciting opportunity that a Bachelor of Arts in Geography presents, particularly regarding a career in the mining industry.

Geography plays a pivotal role in the mining sector. Understanding the earth's surface, terrain, and the distribution of resources is fundamental in mining operations. Here's why a BA in Geography could be a valuable asset for your future in mining:

Spatial Analysis: Geography offers insights into spatial analysis, which is crucial in identifying optimal locations for mining sites, assessing geological formations, and understanding terrain variations that impact mining activities.

Resource Management: Studying Geography equips you with knowledge of natural resource distribution. This includes understanding mineral deposits, water resources, and environmental factors critical for sustainable mining practices.

Environmental Impact Assessment: Mining operations often have environmental implications. A Geography background provides expertise in assessing and managing these impacts, ensuring responsible and eco-friendly mining practices.

Geospatial Technology: Geography programs often cover geospatial technologies like GIS (Geographic Information Systems) and remote sensing. These tools are extensively used in the mining industry for mapping, exploration, and monitoring purposes.

Global Perspective: Geography offers a broad understanding of global landscapes, cultures, and economic factors. This broader perspective is invaluable in navigating international mining operations and understanding diverse market landscapes.

By pursuing a BA in Geography, you'll acquire a versatile skill set that aligns perfectly with the needs of the mining industry. Your knowledge of spatial analysis, resource management, and environmental considerations will be invaluable assets in this field.
