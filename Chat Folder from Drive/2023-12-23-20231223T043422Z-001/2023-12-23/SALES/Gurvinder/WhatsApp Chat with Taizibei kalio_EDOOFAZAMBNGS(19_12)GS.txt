19/12/23, 2:07 pm - Gurvinder: Excuse me, Mrs Nkhata.
19/12/23, 2:07 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more about the program.
19/12/23, 2:07 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
19/12/23, 2:07 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
19/12/23, 2:08 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
19/12/23, 2:08 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
19/12/23, 2:08 pm - Gurvinder: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia*
19/12/23, 2:08 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 2:08 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 2:08 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
19/12/23, 2:10 pm - +260 96 5067812: Yes sir
19/12/23, 2:30 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Taizibei, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
19/12/23, 2:32 pm - +260 96 5067812: Yes sir
19/12/23, 2:47 pm - Gurvinder: Now Taizibei, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?

5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in Grade 12?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

21/12/23, 12:37 pm - +260 96 5067812: 1.My name is Taizibei Kalio am eighteen years old and I just finished writing my grade 12 exams this year.
2.I would like to study bachelors in computer science.
3.My dad is a coordinator at lower Zambezi national park and my mom is a farmer and a house wife.
4.My dad finished his grade 12 exams and started working at the park not quite sure about mom.
5.The people who have been supporting my education are my aunty,uncle and dad.
6.My aunty and uncle will continue to support my education abroad.
7.Yes! I do have siblings the younger ones are still in school and my older sister is a teacher.
8.I was at Njase Girls secondary,in southern province of Zambia.
21/12/23, 1:33 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
21/12/23, 1:42 pm - +260 96 5067812: Well..I feel studying abroad gives me more advantage and most schools abroad give more opportunities to jobs .Most schools in my country also have challenges with accommodation due to congestion  which may also not be the case abroad , I feel.
21/12/23, 2:30 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
21/12/23, 2:35 pm - +260 96 5067812: Well as suggested to study bachelors in computer science I would help my country by introducing the skills I'll learn to my work mates and family members and friends because Zambia is a developing country and is still developing when it comes to technology too.
21/12/23, 2:39 pm - +260 96 5067812: And since I can work anywhere which can also be in the education sector many students or learners can learn from me  and at least that would make a difference
21/12/23, 2:44 pm - +260 96 5067812: For example as a programmer I can be able to be programming a lot of things like softwares, operating systems  and many more
21/12/23, 3:02 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Taizibei, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
21/12/23, 3:03 pm - +260 96 5067812: Yes I agree
21/12/23, 3:22 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
21/12/23, 3:22 pm - +260 96 5067812: Yes
21/12/23, 3:31 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

*Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*
