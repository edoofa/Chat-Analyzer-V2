Im a hard working student who has a passion in Computer Science. I learn at Presbyterian High school in Mhondoro, Mashonaland West. It's a boarding school and the school fees is almost 700USD rounded off.
I have strength in learning new concepts fast, Hardworking, passionate in everything I do and also i like to get things done as a team that's what motivates me. My weakness is im an introvert and don't talk much to people I'm not comfortable with but I'm tryna fix it since opportunities like these requires me to be more flexible.
My family background is so stable. My parents insist I get my education in Zimbabwe, since this Schoolarship is a 50-100% they might be flexible to send me out and get an education and explore since they can afford my education this side. And yeah they are educated too.
