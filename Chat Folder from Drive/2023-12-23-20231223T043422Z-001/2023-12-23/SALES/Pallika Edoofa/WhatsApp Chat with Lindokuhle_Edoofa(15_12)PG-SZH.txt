19/12/23, 9:03 am - +263 78 904 5337: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 9:06 am - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, Lindokuhle, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
19/12/23, 9:07 am - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
19/12/23, 9:12 am - +263 78 904 5337: Yes indeed I have researched about foreign education but never applied am waiting to finish my A level as I feel it is a very important step in education before one goes to tertiary
19/12/23, 9:12 am - +263 78 904 5337: Well understood @917982048840

19/12/23, 9:16 am - +263 78 904 5337: Thank you ✅ I guess I had not given much thought to scam artists but my parents where concerned
19/12/23, 9:27 am - Pallika Edoofa: I can understand!
19/12/23, 9:29 am - Pallika Edoofa: Based on my evaluation, considering your subjects, interests, and passion, you are eligible to pursue


*Bachelor of Commerce (B.com)*



Do you want me to explain the course in depth?
19/12/23, 9:29 am - +263 78 904 5337: Yes please

19/12/23, 9:30 am - Pallika Edoofa: *I hope this course aligns with what you are aiming for*
19/12/23, 9:32 am - +263 78 904 5337: I was drawn by Actuarial Scieace and ACCA can you explain those ones to me
19/12/23, 9:46 am - Pallika Edoofa: Lindokuhle, But you have mentioned that you were interested in Business. And also, Note that If you aspire to pursue Actuarial Science and ACCA, opting for a BCom (Bachelor of Commerce) is a recommended path.

20/12/23, 9:24 am - +263 78 904 5337: Well, after completing the undergrade Programe for 3 years, I will partake in some kind of employment that is in the field of Bachelors in Commerce(technology or telecommunications etc) in order to gain expirience in the field. After that I will then apply I will then take up my masters to further enhance my skills. Without Edoofa all of this would not be possible
20/12/23, 9:34 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Lindokuhle, I appreciate and admire your insight.

However, as your concierge, I would like to inform you that the professional path you have selected will need a significant amount of hard work and attention.

So, are you prepared to put in *200%* effort and seize any possibilities that come your way in order to alter your career?

*“The only way to have a life is to commit to it like crazy.”*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
21/12/23, 8:44 am - +263 78 904 5337: Good morning
Yes we shall
21/12/23, 8:45 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Lindokuhle, continuing the session, So now as you are aware that Edoofa Recommends *India* as a Higher Education Platform
By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
21/12/23, 8:46 am - +263 78 904 5337: I am not completely oblivious but I am aware it is costly
21/12/23, 8:51 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
21/12/23, 8:52 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 8:52 am - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.





*So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?*
21/12/23, 8:55 am - +263 78 904 5337: Much to our disappointment this is very expensive even with the scholarship package
21/12/23, 8:57 am - Pallika Edoofa: I understand that, Lindokuhle, 


let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
21/12/23, 8:59 am - +263 78 904 5337: Am thinking that Edoofa's package is one that offers employment whilst learning giving the applicant an opportunity to pay off schoolfees
21/12/23, 9:01 am - Pallika Edoofa: Lindokuhle, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
21/12/23, 9:01 am - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
21/12/23, 9:01 am - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
21/12/23, 9:01 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
21/12/23, 9:01 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 9:01 am - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
21/12/23, 9:01 am - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
21/12/23, 9:12 am - +263 78 904 5337: I genuinely this that the earn while you learn Programe is a good idea considering the fact that most international students find it hard to adopt into the local market.
Am growing very fond of Edoofa
21/12/23, 9:13 am - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
21/12/23, 9:16 am - +263 78 904 5337: I understand but then the work while you earn Programe only proves funding for payment of tuition or is the salary that the student earns monitered?
21/12/23, 9:18 am - Pallika Edoofa: Lindokuhle, through this program you will be able to earn 50-100$ scholarship credits every month that will reduce your tuition fees.
21/12/23, 9:19 am - +263 78 904 5337: I get it now Pallika
21/12/23, 9:19 am - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!
21/12/23, 9:19 am - Pallika Edoofa: Now, As we are proceeding towards the end of the session, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
21/12/23, 9:25 am - +263 78 904 5337: I like point 1 and 3 the most because they specifically cater to my needs as an individual
21/12/23, 9:25 am - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 

Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

21/12/23, 9:26 am - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
21/12/23, 9:26 am - +263 78 904 5337: The parents will be the ones that will be helping with the fees
21/12/23, 9:30 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
21/12/23, 9:46 am - +263 78 904 5337: Like any parent they are disheartened that thier last born child would be going overseas but at the same time they are excited of the opportunities that their daughter will expirience
21/12/23, 9:52 am - Pallika Edoofa: Lindokuhle, Certainly understand the mixed emotions. It's natural for parents to feel disheartened about their last-born going overseas, yet the excitement for the opportunities awaiting their daughter is also palpable. It's a bittersweet moment, and your understanding of their feelings is evident.
21/12/23, 9:52 am - Pallika Edoofa: Also as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
21/12/23, 9:53 am - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
21/12/23, 10:00 am - +263 78 904 5337: Yes it and also police clearance am sure you wouldn't want to admit anyone with a criminal record.
And also the applicants grades
21/12/23, 10:02 am - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, Lindokuhle, I have listed the main requirements.
21/12/23, 10:02 am - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
21/12/23, 10:03 am - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
21/12/23, 10:03 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 10:03 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
21/12/23, 10:05 am - +263 78 904 5337: Yes please
21/12/23, 10:07 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
21/12/23, 10:07 am - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
21/12/23, 10:07 am - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
