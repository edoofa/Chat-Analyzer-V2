22/12/23, 1:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
22/12/23, 1:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
22/12/23, 1:10 pm - +263 78 623 8811: Yes Iam
22/12/23, 1:11 pm - +263 78 623 8811: No i just searched for  names of universities abroad
22/12/23, 1:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/12/23, 1:15 pm - +263 78 623 8811: Ok thank you for sharing
22/12/23, 1:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Anotida, Based on my evaluation, considering your subjects, interests, and passion, you are eligible to pursue

*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*

*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.
*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.
