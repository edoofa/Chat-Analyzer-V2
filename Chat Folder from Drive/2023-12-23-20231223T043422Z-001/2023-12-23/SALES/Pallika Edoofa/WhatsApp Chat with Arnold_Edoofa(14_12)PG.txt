15/12/23, 7:49 am - +263 77 268 6147: Good morning Edoofa team,my name is Herbert Mutanda a father to Arnold.

I have gone through your discussion With my son on various areas.He answered you very well but there are some areas which I need to revisit.

You noted that you offer 50-100% scholarship on tuition fees which is very commendable. Arnold has 3  other siblings who need to be taken care of back home,as a result given the the scenario of Zimbabwe's economic situation,I don't think as parents of Arnold we will manage transport and living costs based on our earnings.

I suggest if you have a special package for those who are less privileged,you may help by adding his name on that list.

On the issue of tuition fees,you only mentioned that you offer 50-100% but I don't know the actual tuition fees I have to pay on top of your provision.

Thank you.
15/12/23, 12:30 pm - +263 78 495 8058: Good afternoon

15/12/23, 1:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I do understand the challenges Mr Herbert and we will be discussing all the aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program in detail in this session where I will also be guiding you through the cost of education.
15/12/23, 1:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence

Are you ready?
19/12/23, 8:35 am - Pallika Edoofa: Arnold, I appreciate and admire your insight.

However, as your concierge, I would like to inform you that the professional path you have selected will need a significant amount of hard work and attention.

So, are you prepared to put in *200%* effort and seize any possibilities that come your way in order to alter your career?

19/12/23, 9:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: Arnold, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
19/12/23, 9:25 am - +263 78 495 8058: oky i understand this is Great... i wanted to add Communication skills to my combination... an Arts subjesct twhich is compulsory

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

21/12/23, 9:06 am - Pallika Edoofa: Continuing the session, If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
21/12/23, 9:11 am - +263 78 495 8058: wow this is Great... i mean this is totally something good

So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
21/12/23, 9:32 am - +263 78 495 8058: well they think its a Great opportunity but they also think its unsafe there

21/12/23, 9:37 am - Pallika Edoofa: I understand their concern, Arnold, Being a parent, the concern regarding the welfare and personal development of their child is absolutely understandable. 

To give a glimpse, we have a community of more than 2500 Zimbabweans with  300+ associate schools from Zimbabwe with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, and parents, who have been bringing success stories of Edoofians for the past 14+ years due to the kind of foster and care that we provide throughout their course!

With UGC-approved Universities whose degrees are Globally accredited, and which have all security and healthcare facilities including counselling departments, Edoofians are exposed to a conducive environment that motivates them to focus on their career and achieve their dreams. There are Zimbabwean Communities at Every University so no child will feel lonely. Moreover, our Admission Team, EWYL(Earn While You Learn) mentor and counsellor of a student will be available to him/her throughout the course. At any point, if the student or parent needs assistance we will be readily accessible. This is the reason why Edoofa is known as a *Higher Education Concierge!*

The Universities are strict in terms of the welfare of children. Being in Zimbabwe itself, your parents will be able to track the happenings, academic performance, and University details

21/12/23, 9:43 am - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?

21/12/23, 9:46 am - +263 78 495 8058: oky so yu can even tell the mentors the challenges yu are facing on the EWYL program
21/12/23, 9:46 am - +263 78 495 8058: yess thats all it
21/12/23, 9:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
21/12/23, 9:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
21/12/23, 9:56 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 9:56 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
21/12/23, 10:19 am - +263 78 495 8058: ohhh i see 😰
21/12/23, 10:20 am - +263 78 495 8058: oky i understand
21/12/23, 10:20 am - +263 78 495 8058: yess
21/12/23, 10:20 am - +263 78 495 8058: please
21/12/23, 10:28 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
21/12/23, 10:28 am - Pallika Edoofa: This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
21/12/23, 10:28 am - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
21/12/23, 10:29 am - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
21/12/23, 10:30 am - +263 78 495 8058: oky i understand this is all a lot from and i appreciate all this
21/12/23, 10:31 am - +263 78 495 8058: as for me... you said l'll be part of the 2025 intake i think by then we'll have had the fee prepared

21/12/23, 10:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Arnold!
21/12/23, 10:43 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 11:09 am - +263 78 495 8058: oky so this is the personalized counseling session
21/12/23, 11:10 am - +263 78 495 8058: i guess we've finished stage 1

21/12/23, 11:18 am - +263 78 495 8058: so umm l wanna hear from you... what do think bout our first stage session did it go GRt
21/12/23, 11:20 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's right!!
21/12/23, 11:20 am - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
21/12/23, 11:21 am - +263 78 495 8058: yess please
21/12/23, 11:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5*: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.



*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*



This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
21/12/23, 11:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
21/12/23, 11:29 am - +263 78 495 8058: yess I'm now clear with the process
21/12/23, 11:31 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Arnold, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*
 
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -

I hope you are doing well
22/12/23, 10:34 am - Pallika Edoofa: Did you manage to discuss the Edoofa Program with your family, please?
22/12/23, 10:35 am - +263 78 495 8058: yes we discussed pretty much about the EWYL programme and they understood how it works
22/12/23, 10:36 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, can you provide a summary of your family discussions regarding the Edoofa Scholarship Program and share their thoughts after learning more about the program?
22/12/23, 10:41 am - +263 78 495 8058: yess well we understood that the Edoofa scholarship program is a great opportunity for someone like me, also it is safe and secure.
the EWYL program is something i could do so that it becomes affordable

we've also agreed that we'll go through the stages until I'm proud to be an Edoofian

through the EWYL programme my parents have agreed that they'll manage the expenses

they think this is an opportunity i i must be serious cause i will never get another chance like this one
22/12/23, 10:43 am - Pallika Edoofa: Excellent, well it seems that you took your family through the entire conversation which we did during your counseling session! May I know if your family has any questions for me?
22/12/23, 11:01 am - +263 77 268 6147: I have gone through your conversation with Arnold,it seems he is copying up.i have realised that you have a great understanding on career guidance.

On the issue of area of study I think you should advise him well so that he makes a well informed decision.

I like your approach and advise,well done.
22/12/23, 11:02 am - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Herbert, I am glad you understand this opportunity's importance and the power to transform your child's career!
22/12/23, 11:02 am - Pallika Edoofa: This is well noted, 
May I know your thoughts regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
22/12/23, 11:13 am - +263 77 268 6147: Given the fact that we come from a poor background I think we should collaborate on the financial aspect so that we achieve a common goal.for the mean time you may go ahead with your dialogue with Arnold.

I think you understand the situation in Zimbabwe,we are surviving through a rough course as a result I can not guarantee you that by the time Arnold finishes his high school I will be in a  position to sustain those experiences.
22/12/23, 11:32 am - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Herbert,  I do understand the challenges, did you manage to compare the cost of education in Zimbabwe with that through the Edoofa Scholarship Program?
22/12/23, 11:39 am - +263 77 268 6147: It's expensive here in Zimbabwe that is why youths here doesn't achieve their goals academically
22/12/23, 11:40 am - Pallika Edoofa: Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months this year and let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
22/12/23, 11:40 am - Pallika Edoofa: At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self-sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program. We also ensure they develop employability skills so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate. I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your child’s career, aren't you?
22/12/23, 11:47 am - +263 77 268 6147: That's a fantastic approach,I think it will work that way.Earn while You Learn is a better approach because it eases our financial tension,
22/12/23, 11:58 am - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed!
22/12/23, 11:58 am - Pallika Edoofa: I appreciate your willingness to invest in your child’s career
22/12/23, 11:58 am - Pallika Edoofa: Arnold, Before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me?

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
22/12/23, 12:31 pm - +263 78 495 8058: 1) Bachelor of Arts in Geography

2) India

3)$6 000/$8 000 per year

4)$2 000/ $3 000 per year

5)$500 - $1 000 within 3 to 4 months
22/12/23, 12:31 pm - +263 78 495 8058: 6) the Earn While You Learn program... (EWYL) is part of the Edoofa scholarship program in which students are given actual online projects during which they gain work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits. The credits can be used to pay off part if their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable

the Earn While You Learn programe helps the students to learn and develop the skills of his/ her feild study

The EWYL Program also helps in growth of a student and providing a boost for the student to keep up with the changing market

Through the EWYL programe chances of getting employment after graduation are high

It also helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local communities which are more expensive

If a student manage to earn scholarship credits based on his/ her performance, the cost of his education will be further decreased down to $1 000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student's education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month

As much as a student is willing to work hard to sponser his higher education, he/ she can earn accordingly

7) yess I'm clear about the same
22/12/23, 12:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good Work, Arnold!!
22/12/23, 12:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/12/23, 12:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/12/23, 12:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Dear parents @263772686147 @263773093282 , Before proceeding further, we would like to ensure that you are fully aligned and supportive of the career path of your child. Please go through the letter from our Program Director addressed to the parents of our applicants. Your role in your child's higher education is significant with moral and financial support, and your active participation is greatly appreciated.

 We will begin the eligibility check process today and you can expect the results in the coming days. *If your child's application is found eligible, are you in a position to raise the enrollment fee within the 7-day timeframe or as per the payment plan($200 in 7 days and $150 in 30 days)?* Your acknowledgement is expected at the earliest and is mandatory to proceed. Do not hesitate to share if you have any challenges.

*Please share your acknowledgement using voice notes*
22/12/23, 12:38 pm - +263 78 495 8058: oky thank you
22/12/23, 12:39 pm - +263 78 495 8058: ohh we are to do the eligibility check process right here in this group online
22/12/23, 12:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That will be done after your parents will acknowledge that!
22/12/23, 12:47 pm - +263 78 495 8058: oky i understand
22/12/23, 12:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: May I know when will they acknowledge?
22/12/23, 12:51 pm - +263 78 495 8058: i do not know but soon enough... there still at their workplace
22/12/23, 12:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Can you confirm from them and let me know!
22/12/23, 12:57 pm - +263 78 495 8058: As we discussed we were willing to knoe that if I'm found eligible we're to raise the enrollment fee immediately in 7 days and the rest in 30 days

My parents are assuming that they will be in a position to raise the enrollment fee when i finish my A level examinations next year 2024 and they will do the payment plan around this time next year... of which I'm to go to University the following year 2025
22/12/23, 12:59 pm - +263 78 495 8058: how long does it take for me to be found eligible
22/12/23, 1:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Arnold, There are two important reasons why the 2025 intake has been open now!

1) Zimbabwean students receive the results very late compared to other African Nations. The WAEC results of Ghana, Nigeria and other Western African Nations are declared mid-year. Malawians receive around the same time, Zambians receive the results much earlier compared to Zimbabwe, and students from other nations will be occupying the majority of the scholarship seats. This is the reason, we evaluate the O level and term results, interests and passion, career goals, extracurriculars, achievements, roles of responsibilities etc to evaluate the form 5 students for the Edoofa scholarship program. We also give the opportunity to parents to take part in the sessions on behalf of applicants so that deserving applicants do not miss the golden opportunity.
22/12/23, 1:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Moreover, do you feel your family can be prepared for your higher education abroad just within a few months after your A level results?
22/12/23, 1:06 pm - +263 78 495 8058: yess, exactly
22/12/23, 1:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand but most families find it challenging to prepare for their child's higher education abroad within a short span considering the economic challenges in Zimbabwe
22/12/23, 1:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As, Early financial planning for tertiary education is crucial for parents for several reasons:

*Cost of Education:* Tertiary education, including college or university, can be expensive. Tuition fees, books, accommodation, and other associated costs can add up significantly. Planning allows parents to save and budget for these expenses, reducing the financial burden when the time comes.

*Time Horizon:* Tertiary education typically takes several years to complete. By starting to save early, parents have a longer time horizon to accumulate the necessary funds.

*Financial Stability:* By planning early, parents can avoid financial stress and debt. Without proper planning, they may have to rely on loans or other high-cost financing options, which can lead to long-term financial challenges. SAVE YOURSELF FROM LOANS

*INTERNSHIPS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK:* Early planning can also involve students participating in projects that will be offered by the EWYL Department of Edoofa after Induction which can help offset the cost of education. These opportunities often have application deadlines, so planning allows parents to take advantage of them.

*Teach Financial Responsibility:* Involving children in the financial planning process can teach them valuable lessons about money management, savings, and responsibility. It helps instill good financial habits from an early age.

*Avoiding Last-Minute Rush:* Delaying financial planning until the last minute can lead to rushed decisions and inadequate savings. Early planning provides a more thoughtful and organized approach.

*Goal Setting:* Setting specific financial goals for education allows parents to track their progress and adjust their savings strategies as needed. It provides a clear roadmap for achieving the desired educational outcomes.

*Peace of Mind:* Knowing that you have a financial plan in place for your child's education can provide peace of mind. It reduces uncertainty and allows parents to focus on other aspects of their child's development without constant worry about funding education.

In conclusion, early financial planning for tertiary education is essential for parents to ensure that they can provide their children with quality education without compromising their own financial stability. It allows for more effective financial management and better opportunities for both parents and students. <This message was edited>
22/12/23, 1:11 pm - +263 78 495 8058: Oky i understand in Zimbabwe we start our exams in mid October and end in November... we expect our A level results the following year around February... so if we start the eligibility check when exactly will the results come out
22/12/23, 1:12 pm - +263 78 495 8058: i understand
22/12/23, 1:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Arnold, You don't have to wait for your results, Arnold, because once you qualify and enroll, you can begin the Earn While you Learn Program while being in Zimbabwe itself to gain experiences and earn scholarship credits
22/12/23, 1:16 pm - +263 78 495 8058: i mean the eligibility check process, when will you decide that I'm eligible... if we start the test today
22/12/23, 1:17 pm - +263 78 495 8058: oky i understand
22/12/23, 1:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, Arnold, If we begin your eligibility check stage today, it would be of 1-2 days after which the results will be out which means if you qualifies for the Edoofa Scholarship, the due date for the first part of the enrollment fee ($200)will fall on the next week of December and remaining $150 in January. Is your family confident and comfortable with the timeframe?
22/12/23, 1:18 pm - +263 78 495 8058: This means i can begin my EWYL program during the period of waiting for A level results
