04/11/23, 11:48 am - Pallika Edoofa: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India have a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
04/11/23, 11:51 am - +263 78 634 8127: I believe India offers the best education and being there can help me get a good job in a good country
04/11/23, 11:52 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Ruvimmbo, I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students can achieve their career goals and have a prosperous career ahead of them.

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
04/11/23, 11:53 am - +263 78 634 8127: No
04/11/23, 11:53 am - +263 78 634 8127: We are not aware
04/11/23, 12:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Please let Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

06/11/23, 10:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings!

I am here to begin our session,

Shall we begin with your session?
06/11/23, 10:56 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Ruvimbo, I understand the network challenges that you are facing, Please let me know once available.
06/11/23, 11:39 am - +263 71 370 6111: I'm ready ,, my network is stable
06/11/23, 11:44 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's great, Ruvimbo, However, I hope that you have gone through this, and hope that you have discussed it with family.
06/11/23, 11:45 am - Pallika Edoofa: Furthermore, let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
06/11/23, 11:49 am - +263 71 370 6111: No I'm not aware
06/11/23, 11:51 am - +263 71 370 6111: Yes I have
06/11/23, 12:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Ruvimbo, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
06/11/23, 12:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
06/11/23, 12:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
06/11/23, 12:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
06/11/23, 12:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
06/11/23, 12:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 12:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
06/11/23, 12:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
06/11/23, 12:39 pm - +263 71 370 6111: I'm definitely surely that I will benefit from the EWYL program basing on what you have told me
06/11/23, 12:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
06/11/23, 12:44 pm - +263 71 370 6111: It's becoming more clear now ,,
06/11/23, 12:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!!!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
06/11/23, 1:07 pm - +263 71 370 6111: Yes I am ,,, honestly i like all 4 points and choosing would be a difficult thing because all 4 points are of benefit to me and the career i want to persue
06/11/23, 1:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 

Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.
