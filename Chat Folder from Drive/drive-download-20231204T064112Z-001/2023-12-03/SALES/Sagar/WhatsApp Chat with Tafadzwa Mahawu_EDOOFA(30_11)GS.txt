30/11/23, 4:50 pm - Sagar: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
30/11/23, 5:55 pm - +263 78 942 4537: Thank you so much sir
30/11/23, 5:56 pm - +263 78 942 4537: I'm sorry to be honest with you l haven't learnt anything since l was introduced the Edoofa Program but l would like to learn more
01/12/23, 8:04 am - Sagar: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
01/12/23, 8:05 am - +263 78 942 4537: Yah that is actually true good morning sir
01/12/23, 8:24 am - Sagar: Let us continue the session by briefing you about the program.
01/12/23, 8:24 am - Sagar: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
01/12/23, 8:24 am - Sagar: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
01/12/23, 8:24 am - Sagar: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
01/12/23, 8:25 am - Sagar: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
01/12/23, 8:35 am - +263 78 942 4537: Yes of cause sir especially the sense of reducing financial burden because my mom is a widow
01/12/23, 8:47 am - Sagar: Okay so Tafadzwa, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
01/12/23, 8:47 am - Sagar: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
01/12/23, 8:47 am - Sagar: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
01/12/23, 8:51 am - +263 78 942 4537: I understand your requirements sir but my mom is an occupied  person she is free on weekends especially Sunday
01/12/23, 8:53 am - +263 78 942 4537: I understand sir but lm willing to give my full participation and best effort in the counselling process, lm am a person of my word l assure you sir
01/12/23, 8:53 am - Sagar: Noted, will she be able to go through the counselling session when she gets free?
01/12/23, 8:54 am - Sagar: And I hope you too will brief her about the program.
01/12/23, 8:54 am - +263 78 942 4537: Yah l will make sure of that and l will tell her everything she has to know about the programme
01/12/23, 8:55 am - Sagar: That is great.
01/12/23, 8:56 am - Sagar: Alright so Tafadzwa, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

01/12/23, 12:27 pm - Sagar: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
01/12/23, 12:27 pm - Sagar: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
01/12/23, 12:29 pm - +263 78 942 4537: I'm am confident about myself sir and l will surely pass and embrace your expectations

01/12/23, 12:33 pm - Sagar: *Bachelor of Journalism and Mass Communications (B.J.M.C)* is a 3-year duration undergraduate program for students who wish to pursue their career in Journalism and media industry.
01/12/23, 12:33 pm - Sagar: The Career Options and Job opportunities are very high with the media sector. A student who has completed B.J.M.C can work with the news channels, news magazines, publication houses, Media is a connection between the population and the world. It is an important source by which anybody can get information at the same time and at different places.

01/12/23, 2:55 pm - Sagar: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
01/12/23, 3:21 pm - +263 78 942 4537: Sir it my honour to write this to you                             l hereby write this essay putting much emphasis on how l see myself after 5 years completion of  the programme and how Edoofa can enable me to achieve my dreams.              International journalism is my passion and my dream too, l see my self as a great person in my society, country and world too after the 5 year completion of the  programme , my dream is to facilitate a good information world for my country and the world at large, l see my self as capable and with great potential and ability to achieve the things l have mentioned above. At the pick of financial crisis I my family Edoofa is like the rising sun that touches the flora and fauna at the beginning of a new spring, lt is like the good samaritan that comes at the right time when the patient needed help. I have 100 % belief that the Edoofa will help me with their scholarship and make a big drive in my to way to become a  successful journalist, l am sure they will provide me with the financial necessities l will need to archive my goals and l really trust their program and have full faith that they will help me.                 Thank you
01/12/23, 3:22 pm - Sagar: That is really great Tafadzwa, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
01/12/23, 3:27 pm - +263 78 942 4537: I as a young boy growing up in a poor society hardwork is the first required survival skill and my experiences have moulded me into a hard worker. I know the industry has many obstacles but my strong sprit and hard work will surely overwhelm them until l reach my goals
01/12/23, 3:38 pm - Sagar: That is great.
01/12/23, 3:38 pm - Sagar: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
01/12/23, 3:45 pm - +263 78 942 4537: Studying in my country is actually is good but most universities in my country require points above 14 to do such programs and vacancies are not easily accessible when you come from poor families they require connections and if you see only a minimum number of poor people study in  local universities
01/12/23, 3:48 pm - +263 78 942 4537: These universities some of them don't offer big programs and those who does offer are overcrowded and has rich people as thier first priference and are not easily accessible
01/12/23, 3:48 pm - Sagar: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
01/12/23, 3:57 pm - +263 78 942 4537: That is actually a gorger question, when l become a journalist at least l will have power to enlighten my people to fight towards change, equality and freedom, in that sense they will fight for change and that will mean a new beginning in the education system where there is just and fairness, similar to the French revolution were  philosophers enlightened the people to liberty, equality and fraternity
01/12/23, 3:59 pm - Sagar: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Tafadzwa, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
01/12/23, 4:05 pm - +263 78 942 4537: I do agree with you sir everyone is a product of the environment they grow up in and a conducive environment, a good reputation and utmost dedication will help in the drive for change in my community and the education system of my country
01/12/23, 4:05 pm - Sagar: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
01/12/23, 4:07 pm - +263 78 942 4537: Yah of cause l want to know but as times pass other countries have fought corruption and created an identity for themselves and they have even developed
01/12/23, 4:09 pm - Sagar: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
01/12/23, 4:10 pm - Sagar: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
01/12/23, 4:18 pm - +263 78 942 4537: No not at all sir you can proceed with the session lm really OK
01/12/23, 5:05 pm - +263 78 942 4537: I think you must have been working for so long and your day is over at work thank you for today's conversation have a good day,. Till the take care we will catch up tommorow

02/12/23, 10:02 am - Sagar: Good morning, Tafadzwa.
02/12/23, 10:02 am - Sagar: So let us continue the session.
02/12/23, 10:02 am - Sagar: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
02/12/23, 10:07 am - +263 78 942 4537: No sir thy are not familiar with the cost of similar quality education for international student without scholarship in lndia
02/12/23, 10:15 am - Sagar: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
02/12/23, 10:15 am - Sagar: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
02/12/23, 10:15 am - Sagar: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

02/12/23, 10:16 am - Sagar: In simple words Tafadzwa what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
02/12/23, 11:07 am - +263 78 942 4537: OK sir l got it very  well
02/12/23, 11:16 am - Sagar: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
02/12/23, 11:18 am - +263 78 942 4537: Yah of cause you can go ahead
02/12/23, 11:19 am - Sagar: Tafadzwa, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
02/12/23, 11:23 am - +263 78 942 4537: Yah it is actually amazing for it gives one the chance to work at the same time learning, it also make the University education more affordable
02/12/23, 11:23 am - Sagar: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

02/12/23, 11:23 am - Sagar: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
02/12/23, 11:23 am - Sagar: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

02/12/23, 11:24 am - Sagar: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
02/12/23, 11:24 am - Sagar: *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
02/12/23, 11:28 am - +263 78 942 4537: Of cause l think this will benefit me a lot you know getting to know your carrier before graduation gives you hope and confidence to work hard
02/12/23, 11:30 am - Sagar: I am delighted to hear that Tafadzwa, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
02/12/23, 11:35 am - +263 78 942 4537: The earn and learn enhances the skills of a student to earn money for a living, when you earn and learn this will reduce the cost of the university fees and at the same time making education affordable for you will be deducting some money from the original price
02/12/23, 11:37 am - Sagar: That is correct.
02/12/23, 11:37 am - Sagar: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

02/12/23, 11:37 am - Sagar: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
02/12/23, 11:42 am - +263 78 942 4537: First of all l must say this is so motivating and encouraging
02/12/23, 11:44 am - +263 78 942 4537: Yah of cause it is something l have been looking for especially the sense of being financially indipentent at a young age it's very motivating even to other people in the society
02/12/23, 11:45 am - Sagar: Tafadzwa, by now, I hope you have understood that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is not merely a platform for students to gain admission to an internationally recognized university. It offers much more. Among various differentiators, the value provided by Edoofa to a particular student surpasses that offered by any admission agent or consultant.
02/12/23, 11:45 am - +263 78 942 4537: Yah that is true and undeniable
02/12/23, 11:46 am - Sagar: Alright Tafadzwa, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
02/12/23, 11:48 am - +263 78 942 4537: No not at all sir she  is  not capable of doing so that is the reoson why l applied for the scholarship
02/12/23, 11:49 am - +263 78 942 4537: By now l hope you have understood my background and situation so well sir
02/12/23, 12:02 pm - Sagar: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 9:30 AM. Please be online during your session time!
