29/11/23, 10:37 am - Sagar: Noted
29/11/23, 10:38 am - Sagar: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Fadzai,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
29/11/23, 10:54 am - +263 71 837 4564: Thank you so much Mr Gurvinder for having here on this platform
29/11/23, 10:54 am - Sagar: It is my pleasure.
29/11/23, 10:55 am - Sagar: Alright, so Fadzai, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Master, is that correct?
29/11/23, 11:23 am - +263 71 837 4564: Yes that's right
29/11/23, 12:05 pm - Sagar: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Master, also do tell me whether you learnt about Master’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
29/11/23, 12:13 pm - +263 71 837 4564: I learnt that your organisation is offering scholarships and also that I can work while studying
29/11/23, 12:14 pm - Sagar: I see you are well informed.
29/11/23, 12:14 pm - Sagar: Let me also brief you about the program.
29/11/23, 12:14 pm - Sagar: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
29/11/23, 12:14 pm - Sagar: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
29/11/23, 12:15 pm - Sagar: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
29/11/23, 12:15 pm - Sagar: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
29/11/23, 12:15 pm - +263 71 837 4564: Master talked to me about the 5pointer that you offer and that i should do them with outmost sincerity
29/11/23, 12:17 pm - Sagar: That is correct.
29/11/23, 12:17 pm - Sagar: Please address this.
29/11/23, 12:20 pm - +263 71 837 4564: Yes that's true
29/11/23, 12:21 pm - Sagar: Okay so Fadzai, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
29/11/23, 1:00 pm - +263 71 837 4564: Yes . I think I can do it.
29/11/23, 1:05 pm - Sagar: Alright so Fadzai, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
29/11/23, 1:28 pm - +263 71 837 4564: I am  Fadzai Mudzamba. Recently turned 18 and currently in lower 6. Did my form 1-4 at Howard High School in Mashonaland Central. At the end of form 4 , had 5As and 5Bs . Right now i am studying commercials at Zengeza High School and I would like to pursue accounting. I am a part of Environmental Club ten and also a part of the Zengeza Youth Sanctuary club . When i am not studying, i usually spend my time reading novels and helping out in the society. My parents are self employed and they are into farming
29/11/23, 1:29 pm - +263 71 837 4564: I have better leadership skills . I have also been groomed and received leadership training from ICMF ... INTERNATIONAL COACHING AND MENTORSHIP FOUNDATION  under the smart teens life coaching program which is there to improve the teenage and give them life coaching skills
29/11/23, 1:29 pm - Sagar: That is great Fadzai.
29/11/23, 1:30 pm - Sagar: So Fadzai, could you kindly tell me how much *Zengeza High School* charges you every term, who in your family financially supports your education, and what profession they are in?
29/11/23, 1:31 pm - +263 71 837 4564: Each term is charged 75usd and 100rgts . My father who is into farming is the one who pays for my school fees
29/11/23, 1:32 pm - Sagar: Noted.
29/11/23, 1:32 pm - Sagar: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study accounting, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
29/11/23, 1:37 pm - +263 71 837 4564: Zimbabwe is not economically stable and has adopted the dollarization system to help due to an unstable currency. So i have had an interest in accounting with the hope that one day i will be successful in that field and will be able to help in giving back to the society and also improving the economic systems such that the living conditions in this country are improved
29/11/23, 1:38 pm - Sagar: Noted, that is a noble cause.
29/11/23, 1:38 pm - Sagar: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
29/11/23, 2:09 pm - +263 71 837 4564: Actually no one . I am the first one
29/11/23, 2:10 pm - Sagar: Alright so now can you share your O Level and Form 5 results for evaluation?

29/11/23, 3:23 pm - Sagar: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*Bachelor of Commerce (B.com)*
29/11/23, 3:32 pm - +263 71 837 4564: Okay
29/11/23, 3:33 pm - +263 71 837 4564: Noted
29/11/23, 3:37 pm - Sagar: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
29/11/23, 3:37 pm - Sagar: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
29/11/23, 3:52 pm - +263 71 837 4564: Yes i have an aim to achieve higher
29/11/23, 3:55 pm - Sagar: So should I brief you about the course now?
29/11/23, 5:57 pm - +263 71 837 4564: Yes please.
30/11/23, 8:24 am - Sagar: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Education is the key that unlocks the golden door to freedom.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
30/11/23, 8:53 am - +263 71 837 4564: Good morning Mr Gurvinder
30/11/23, 8:53 am - Sagar: Let us continue the session now by briefing you about the course.
30/11/23, 8:54 am - Sagar: *Bachelor of Commerce (B.com)* is a three year long undergraduate course that is evenly distributed into 6 half-yearly semesters. 

A high number of jobs are available for B.com graduates in industries such as Information Technology, Manufacturing, Telecommunications and Banking.The most sought after B.Com. jobs are Financial Manger, Accountant, Lecturer, Chartered Accountant, Human Resource Development etc.
30/11/23, 8:54 am - Sagar: The 3 year B.com degree program aims to facilitate a deep understanding of how business organizations work. It develops knowledge and skills in core B.com subjects like Accounting, Finance, Banking & Insurance, Marketing, Human Resources and Taxation.
The entire B.com syllabus is designed in a manner which develops competency in students, allowing them to pursue higher level programs. It also increases practical knowledge and employability.
30/11/23, 8:54 am - Sagar: After being awarded the B.Com degree, candidates can either look for jobs in various departments or opt for higher education.

*B.Com graduates can pursue post-graduation courses such as M.Com (Master of Commerce), MBA (Master of Business Administration), CA (Chartered Accountant), CS (Company Secretary), Actuarial Scientist, and ACCA (Association of Chartered Accountants).*
30/11/23, 8:54 am - Sagar: *B.Com graduates have a plethora of job positions in government as well as private sectors to choose from provided that they are not limited to careers in accounts and finance*
30/11/23, 9:28 am - +263 71 837 4564: If i  can be an accountant first then continue to being a chartered accountant
30/11/23, 9:30 am - Sagar: Yes, you can.
30/11/23, 9:30 am - Sagar: Did you understand the course?
30/11/23, 9:32 am - +263 71 837 4564: Yes I do.
30/11/23, 9:35 am - +263 71 837 4564: So that means it only takes 3years then I can graduate and have a degree
30/11/23, 9:38 am - Sagar: Yes, that is correct.
30/11/23, 9:38 am - Sagar: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
30/11/23, 10:12 am - +263 71 837 4564: If i am given this opportunity to study under a scholarship with your organisation, I see myself able to pursue my journey of becoming an accountant. And comparing with the time that is taken here in Zimbabwe, that course will take 4 years which is giving me a good year of improving myself and working hard for the betterment of the society at large . I see myself working for a successful organisation before I can proceed to becoming a chartered accountant. This has always been my dream and being given an opportunity to study is a dream coming true it self. I promise to Commit myself to working harder . I also want to help others so that they might also be able to get this chance to study at reputable institutions and get better education so that their future is brighter and they are also able to improve the living conditions of those that are around them.
30/11/23, 10:15 am - Sagar: That is really great Fadzai, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
30/11/23, 10:39 am - +263 71 837 4564: Yes . I am prepared.
30/11/23, 10:43 am - Sagar: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
30/11/23, 1:27 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 1:27 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 1:27 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 1:27 pm - Sagar: Yes, that is true.
30/11/23, 1:46 pm - +263 71 837 4564: I see that they have developed a better system
30/11/23, 1:47 pm - Sagar: So now Fadzai, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
30/11/23, 2:09 pm - +263 71 837 4564: I understand that i can  earn while learning, i have been wondering if its for the whole 3 years or maybe after a while. And I also wanted to know if they offer you jobs right there after graduating since most jobs here require experience of upto 5 years
30/11/23, 2:14 pm - Sagar: The Earn While You Learn program starts from the day when you enrol in the Edoofa program.
30/11/23, 2:14 pm - Sagar: Fadzai, in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!

You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
30/11/23, 2:34 pm - +263 71 837 4564: Ooh . i understand
30/11/23, 2:37 pm - Sagar: So now Fadzai, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
30/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 71 837 4564: I don't have any questions
30/11/23, 2:40 pm - Sagar: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
30/11/23, 2:49 pm - +263 71 837 4564: No . no one from my family has studied abroad
30/11/23, 2:53 pm - Sagar: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
30/11/23, 2:54 pm - Sagar: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
30/11/23, 2:54 pm - Sagar: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
30/11/23, 2:54 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 2:55 pm - Sagar: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
30/11/23, 4:48 pm - Sagar: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
30/11/23, 8:19 pm - +263 71 837 4564: So this amount is for the whole course
30/11/23, 8:24 pm - +263 71 837 4564: Thank you so much for the information
01/12/23, 8:03 am - Sagar: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
01/12/23, 8:58 am - +263 71 837 4564: Good morning Mr Gurvinder
01/12/23, 9:04 am - Sagar: So let us continue the session now.
01/12/23, 9:05 am - Sagar: This is the amount that one has to pay for a year of education, but in simple words Fadzai what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
01/12/23, 9:34 am - +263 71 837 4564: I understand
01/12/23, 9:35 am - Sagar: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
01/12/23, 9:36 am - +263 71 837 4564: Yes please
01/12/23, 9:36 am - Sagar: Fadzai, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
01/12/23, 9:37 am - Sagar: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
01/12/23, 9:37 am - Sagar: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
01/12/23, 9:37 am - Sagar: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
01/12/23, 9:41 am - +263 71 837 4564: That's great
01/12/23, 9:41 am - +263 71 837 4564: Which means getting an opportunity to gain experience
01/12/23, 9:44 am - Sagar: Yes, that is correct.
01/12/23, 9:45 am - Sagar: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

01/12/23, 9:45 am - Sagar: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion.

01/12/23, 9:45 am - Sagar: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
01/12/23, 9:46 am - Sagar: *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
01/12/23, 9:48 am - +263 71 837 4564: I think it will be of great help as i will be gaining experience and also becoming independent
01/12/23, 9:52 am - Sagar: I am delighted to hear that Fadzai, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
01/12/23, 12:15 pm - +263 71 837 4564: Okay
01/12/23, 12:15 pm - +263 71 837 4564: So the more tasks you take the more you can earn and it's giving you an opportunity to reduce the amount that is paid by the parents. I understand
01/12/23, 12:24 pm - Sagar: Yes that is correct.
01/12/23, 12:25 pm - Sagar: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

01/12/23, 12:25 pm - Sagar: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
01/12/23, 12:36 pm - +263 71 837 4564: This is totally unique and out of the box
01/12/23, 12:43 pm - Sagar: Fadzai, by now, I hope you have understood that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is not merely a platform for students to gain admission to an internationally recognized university. It offers much more. Among various differentiators, the value provided by Edoofa to a particular student surpasses that offered by any admission agent or consultant.
01/12/23, 1:03 pm - +263 71 837 4564: Yes i understand
01/12/23, 1:06 pm - Sagar: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
01/12/23, 4:16 pm - +263 71 837 4564: Sorry I wasn't reachable due to network maybe tomorrow morning
01/12/23, 4:34 pm - Sagar: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
02/12/23, 12:00 pm - Sagar: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 9:30 AM. Please be online during your session time!
