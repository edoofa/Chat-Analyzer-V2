02/12/23, 10:39 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/12/23, 10:39 am - Pallika Edoofa: I understand that Ms. Loveness, Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

Will you be able to manage the remaining expenses?
02/12/23, 10:41 am - +263 77 263 4652: I hope so.
02/12/23, 10:41 am - +263 78 155 8395: Our family is from Masvingo Central District under Chief Murinye in Masvingo province. It is a family of six me being the second eldest daughter. I have not yet discovered my weaknesses but what l know is that my strength is being patient. I love playing volleyball game and studying.
02/12/23, 10:42 am - +263 77 263 4652: Given the opportunity i think i can manage
02/12/23, 10:43 am - +263 78 155 8395: Not yet experienced it
02/12/23, 10:43 am - +263 78 155 8395: Am still waiting for my A' level results
02/12/23, 11:01 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's great, Ms. Loveness, However, I do understand the how difficult it is to manage Mangoma's higher education and other children's school expenses.
02/12/23, 11:01 am - Pallika Edoofa: Considering your family conditions, I'd like to highlight the financial aspect of higher education in India for international students. On average, the cost ranges from *$6000-$8000 per year*, which, while lower than many Western countries, may still be a hurdle for some. However, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, eligible students can significantly reduce this cost to *$2000-$3000 per year*. Considering the added benefit of enhancing your employability, especially in comparison to opportunities in your hometown, wouldn't you consider putting in the extra effort to explore this opportunity
02/12/23, 11:21 am - +263 77 263 4652: Some of these opportunities, I lack knowledge. I lack information. Given proper information of the  employment opportunities i can pursue them
02/12/23, 11:30 am - +263 77 263 4652: Where you said ''your employability'. Were you referring to me.
02/12/23, 11:31 am - +263 78 155 8395: My parent
02/12/23, 11:32 am - +263 78 155 8395: She is the one to support me
02/12/23, 11:33 am - +263 77 263 4652: Yes I would like to pursue it especially when I consider the level of employment in our country. The rate of unemployment is too high.
02/12/23, 11:41 am - +263 77 263 4652: I think I can manage to raise the required amount.
02/12/23, 11:45 am - Pallika Edoofa: It was referred to Mangoma
02/12/23, 11:45 am - Pallika Edoofa: Great!!!!
02/12/23, 11:45 am - +263 77 263 4652: Alrighty
02/12/23, 11:45 am - +263 78 155 8395: Okay thank you

02/12/23, 11:46 am - +263 78 155 8395: I would do try my best once l got an opportunity like this one
02/12/23, 11:50 am - +263 78 155 8395: Currently l have O'level results only  and am still waiting for my A'level results
02/12/23, 11:51 am - +263 77 263 4652: <Media omitted>
02/12/23, 11:53 am - +263 77 263 4652: <Media omitted>
02/12/23, 12:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, So, are you having the term results of A level?
02/12/23, 12:13 pm - +263 78 155 8395: Yes I do have
02/12/23, 12:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, Please share that too
02/12/23, 12:15 pm - +263 78 155 8395: Okay
02/12/23, 12:18 pm - +263 77 263 4652: <Media omitted>
02/12/23, 12:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, Ms. Loveness.
02/12/23, 12:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: May I know why the grades are low?
02/12/23, 12:26 pm - +263 77 263 4652: Yes the grades are low. Science teachers are very mobile in our home country and they take long time to replace. So she spent most of the time without a chemistru teacher.
02/12/23, 12:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Ms. Magona, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
02/12/23, 12:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also,As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
02/12/23, 12:30 pm - +263 77 263 4652: Sure I am confident
02/12/23, 12:35 pm - +263 78 155 8395: I did a research in passive. I haven't applied yet
02/12/23, 12:36 pm - +263 78 155 8395: I have hope and trust that l did well
02/12/23, 12:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/12/23, 12:39 pm - +263 78 155 8395: Thank you
02/12/23, 12:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mangoma, I would like to know out of these in which course you are more inclined to medicine, computer science, mechatronics and robotics?
02/12/23, 12:47 pm - +263 78 155 8395: First preference _ medicine
Second preference - robotics | mechatronics 
Third preference - civil engineering
02/12/23, 12:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mangoma, I would like to know that if you are interested in Medicine, so why haven't you opted Biology?
02/12/23, 12:50 pm - +263 78 155 8395: I have passion in computers that's why l opted  physics rather than biology.
02/12/23, 1:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mangoma, Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
02/12/23, 1:25 pm - +263 77 263 4652: She did not do well O level biology because she lacked online lessons during vivid.
02/12/23, 1:25 pm - +263 77 263 4652: But she wanted Medicine
02/12/23, 1:27 pm - +263 77 263 4652: So because of that reason, she could not do A level biology
02/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 77 263 4652: Covid
02/12/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 263 4652: Thank you for such detailed information
02/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 155 8395: Okay thank you
02/12/23, 1:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: No problem, Ms. Lovenes. Considering her subjects and interests, as her counselor, I recommend guiding her toward engineering courses, given her eligibility. Considering her interest in computers, I would suggest a B.Tech in Computer Science (CSE). Alternatively, she could explore Civil Engineering. Would you like a more detailed explanation of these options?
02/12/23, 1:42 pm - +263 78 155 8395: Yes
02/12/23, 1:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Which course you would like me to explain?
02/12/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 155 8395: B tech Computer science
02/12/23, 1:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *B.Tech. Computer Science Engineering* is an engineering undergraduate course in computer sciences
				
A B.Tech. Computer Science graduate has various Career Options and Jobs to choose from. They can work in profiles such as Software Engineer, Data Engineer, Testing Engineer, System Analyst and Technical Support Engineer

This way, these businesses don’t have to build and run their own data centers, which can be way more expensive. The Cloud Computing and Virtualization specialization prepares students to understand the emerging technologies of Cloud Computing and Virtualization, their principles, modeling, analysis, design, deployment, and industry-oriented applications. Major solution architectures and enabling technologies are covered.
