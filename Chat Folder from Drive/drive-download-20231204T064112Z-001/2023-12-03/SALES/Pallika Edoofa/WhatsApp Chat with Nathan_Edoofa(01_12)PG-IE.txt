02/12/23, 12:18 pm - +263 78 944 1188: Thanks
02/12/23, 12:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Also, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
02/12/23, 12:25 pm - +263 77 475 8112: Yes l am
02/12/23, 12:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Nathan
02/12/23, 12:27 pm - +263 77 475 8112: 2 A level passes starting from E or C
02/12/23, 12:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Nathan, I would like to know if you are interested in the Medical Field, so why haven't you opted for Biology in your A level?
02/12/23, 12:31 pm - +263 77 475 8112: Here in Zimbabwe Maths. Physics. CHemistry have many programs to do than Maths Biology and Chemistry so thats why l leave biology
02/12/23, 12:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Nathan, Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
02/12/23, 12:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since you do not have Biology, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine and Pharmacy, but considering your interest there are better courses from the Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help fulfill your dreams of working in this field
