27/10/23, 4:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Based on my evaluation, considering your subjects, interests, and passion, you are eligible to pursue


​*B.Tech Civil Engineering*



Do you want me to explain the course in depth?
27/10/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 989 8389: Go ahead with explanation
27/10/23, 4:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: ​*B.Tech Civil Engineering: What is it About?*

Civil engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines in the world. Civil engineering, until a few decades back, was a much sought after course among Indian students, but lately has been sidelined due to the software and IT boom. However with the increasing need to develop and maintain India’s infrastructure, which is lagging in all aspects, this field is bouncing back strongly.

There are options for higher studies after the completion of B.Tech. course. Students can pursue Master’s degree in specialized course. Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Civil engineering and other allied branches like-

*Structural Engineering*
*Architectural Engineering*
*Geotechnical Engineering*
*Environmental Engineering etc.*

*B.Tech Civil Engineering: Who should opt?*

Before you decide to pursue your undergraduate studies in this field, it is important to understand that Civil engineering is not just about buildings and bridges. If you are under the assumption that all that civil engineers do is wear a yellow helmet and supervise workers in construction sites, then you are yet to understand the true capacity of this field. 


*Career aspects*

In these cases, you will have to hunt for a core engineering job all by yourself through off-campus placements. Creating strong professional networks, developing a great resume with stellar GPA and doing impressive projects and internships will help you secure a job in one of the core civil engineering companies.

Also, civil engineers find work not just in construction industry, but also in other industries such as oil and energy, transportation, petroleum, environmental, power and electric utilities, chemical etc where infrastructure projects and construction facilities are involved. Some students transition to software, consulting or banking as they feel that salary and growth prospects are better in these sectors.
27/10/23, 4:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *I hope this course aligns with what you've been aiming for*
27/10/23, 4:25 pm - +263 77 989 8389: So B. Tech Civil Engineering is specifically for what?
27/10/23, 4:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Dylan, Please read the information thoroughly.
27/10/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 989 8389: Okay noted, yes its good
27/10/23, 4:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Dylan, Since you have understood the course well, can you tell me how you see yourself in 5 years after your course If you are provided with this career option how can being an Edoofian enable you to achieve your career goals?
27/10/23, 4:45 pm - +263 77 989 8389: I think in 5 years time I will be able to achieve the best goals with the assistance of Edoofa
27/10/23, 4:49 pm - +263 77 989 8389: But now am still in A level doing L5
27/10/23, 4:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I appreciate and admire your insight.

However, as your concierge, I would like to inform you that the professional path you have selected will need a significant amount of hard work and attention.

So, are you prepared to put in *200%* effort and seize any possibilities that come your way in order to alter your career?
27/10/23, 4:52 pm - +263 77 989 8389: Yes am prepared or to exceed that 200%
27/10/23, 4:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Dylan, I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career. 

So, now that you have a good vision of your career and insight about the program, are you aware of the country Edoofa recommends for Higher Education?
27/10/23, 4:53 pm - +263 77 989 8389: No
27/10/23, 4:54 pm - +263 77 989 8389: But if not India
27/10/23, 4:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: It is!!
27/10/23, 4:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So now as you are aware Edoofa Recommends *India* as a Higher Education destination

I would be interested to hear your perspective on why you believe studying in India and within the Indian Education System would be instrumental in achieving your dreams.
27/10/23, 5:02 pm - +263 77 989 8389: Studying abroad with the assistance of Edoofa in India can help me to achieve my best goals since Edoofa will with me where ever I am during my studies again India with its technology system can help me too

27/10/23, 5:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India have a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
27/10/23, 6:16 pm - +263 77 989 8389: India is a good country and again with the technology to help me to achieve the best again Edoofa can assist in job findings
27/10/23, 6:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Dylan, I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students can achieve their career goals and have a prosperous career ahead of them.

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
27/10/23, 6:25 pm - +263 77 989 8389: My family can be aware and in any case they can understand and assist, being studying in India will help me to grow internationally
27/10/23, 6:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
27/10/23, 6:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/10/23, 6:29 pm - +263 77 989 8389: To my family alone they cannot afford but if Edoofa have 95% yes the remaining they can afford
27/10/23, 6:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that!!!

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
27/10/23, 6:31 pm - +263 77 989 8389: No I don't know
27/10/23, 6:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
27/10/23, 6:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
27/10/23, 6:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
27/10/23, 6:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
27/10/23, 6:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

27/10/23, 6:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/10/23, 6:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
27/10/23, 6:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
27/10/23, 6:37 pm - +263 77 989 8389: I wish to benefit from EWYLP
27/10/23, 6:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that!!
27/10/23, 6:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*. <This message was edited>
27/10/23, 6:43 pm - +263 77 989 8389: $90 per month the family may try but not on every month sometimes they can failed because they still need some to help them
27/10/23, 6:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Dylan, please note that these are the scholarship credits that are earned by the student themselves.
27/10/23, 6:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Proceeding further,Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
27/10/23, 6:50 pm - +263 77 989 8389: 4
27/10/23, 6:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on *Higher Education Concierge*

Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

27/10/23, 6:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
27/10/23, 6:53 pm - +263 77 989 8389: Family
27/10/23, 6:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
27/10/23, 6:55 pm - +263 77 989 8389: Feel motivated and inspired
27/10/23, 6:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
27/10/23, 6:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
27/10/23, 6:58 pm - +263 77 989 8389: It's this
27/10/23, 6:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
27/10/23, 6:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
27/10/23, 6:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/10/23, 6:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
27/10/23, 7:01 pm - +263 77 989 8389: Yes
27/10/23, 7:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
27/10/23, 7:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
27/10/23, 7:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*

27/10/23, 7:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, Dylan, 
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
27/10/23, 7:16 pm - +263 77 989 8389: Tomorrow my battery is about to die
27/10/23, 7:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Dylan, we about to end the session already
27/10/23, 7:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me explain the other steps,

*Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks. <This message was edited>
27/10/23, 7:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
27/10/23, 7:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.

28/10/23, 6:54 pm - Austin#276: May I know did you managed to discuss the Edoofa Program with your family, please?

28/10/23, 7:07 pm - +263 77 989 8389: Network is bit more challenging today, am sorry
28/10/23, 7:08 pm - Austin#276: So may I know what all discussions you had with your family with regard to the Edoofa Scholarship Program? You can share a summary and their thoughts after getting to know the program well.
28/10/23, 7:09 pm - Austin#276: I can understand
28/10/23, 7:39 pm - +263 77 989 8389: In summary we agreed that Edoofa scholarship can do better for my career in education. Again we agreed to do B. TECH CIVIL ENGINEERING. We discussed that India is the best in terms of fees prices for students from other countries. Edoofa have more Zimbabwean internationals doing their studies in India. We also discussed about the percentage on how it will be paid if they are to pay 90%
28/10/23, 7:41 pm - Austin#276: I am glad your family understands this opportunity's importance and the power to transform your career.
28/10/23, 7:42 pm - +263 77 989 8389: Thank you Sir
28/10/23, 7:42 pm - Austin#276: Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on tuition fees, The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extracurricular Activities
28/10/23, 7:43 pm - +263 77 989 8389: Well, I thank you
28/10/23, 7:44 pm - Austin#276: You are welcome, is your family having any questions for me please?
28/10/23, 7:45 pm - +263 77 989 8389: Yes, they were saying since am still in Form 5 how Edoofa can assist me
28/10/23, 7:47 pm - +263 77 989 8389: Also on transport and other things does Edoofa assist me to come to India
28/10/23, 8:08 pm - Austin#276: Please note that the intake for 2024 and 2025 is already open and form 5&6 students are reserving their seats for the same if they qualify for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. The major reason for opening the Seat Reservation opportunity for Zimbabwean students is that they receive the results very late compared to other African Nations. This is the reason, we evaluate the O level and term results, interests and passion, career goals, extracurricular, achievements, roles of responsibilities etc to evaluate the form 5 students for the Edoofa scholarship program. We also give the opportunity to parents to take part in the sessions on behalf of applicants so that deserving applicants do not miss the golden opportunity.

28/10/23, 8:09 pm - Austin#276: Early financial planning for tertiary education is crucial for parents for several reasons:

*Cost of Education:* Tertiary education, including college or university, can be expensive. Tuition fees, books, accommodation, and other associated costs can add up significantly. Planning allows parents to save and budget for these expenses, reducing the financial burden when the time comes.

*Time Horizon:* Tertiary education typically takes several years to complete. By starting to save early, parents have a longer time horizon to accumulate the necessary funds.

*Financial Stability:* By planning early, parents can avoid financial stress and debt. Without proper planning, they may have to rely on loans or other high-cost financing options, which can lead to long-term financial challenges. SAVE YOURSELF FROM LOANS

*INTERNSHIPS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK:* Early planning can also involve students participating in projects that will be offered by the EWYL Department of Edoofa after Induction which can help offset the cost of education. These opportunities often have application deadlines, so planning allows parents to take advantage of them.

*Teach Financial Responsibility:* Involving children in the financial planning process can teach them valuable lessons about money management, savings, and responsibility. It helps instill good financial habits from an early age.

*Avoiding Last-Minute Rush:* Delaying financial planning until the last minute can lead to rushed decisions and inadequate savings. Early planning provides a more thoughtful and organized approach.

*Goal Setting:* Setting specific financial goals for education allows parents to track their progress and adjust their savings strategies as needed. It provides a clear roadmap for achieving the desired educational outcomes.

*Peace of Mind:* Knowing that you have a financial plan in place for your child's education can provide peace of mind. It reduces uncertainty and allows parents to focus on other aspects of their child's development without constant worry about funding education.


In conclusion, early financial planning for tertiary education is essential for parents to ensure that they can provide their children with quality education without compromising their own financial stability. It allows for more effective financial management and better opportunities for both parents and students.

30/10/23, 8:11 pm - Austin#276: I appreciate the willingness of your family to invest in your career,
30/10/23, 8:11 pm - Austin#276: Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months this year and Let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
30/10/23, 8:12 pm - Austin#276: @263779898389 At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self-sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program. We also ensure them develop employability skills so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate. I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?
30/10/23, 8:22 pm - +263 77 989 8389: I thank you very much with that highlight, very true and well said so am looking forward from you, I thank you
30/10/23, 8:34 pm - Austin#276: You are most welcome, Dylan!
30/10/23, 8:34 pm - Austin#276: So, before we move  to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

7.

Are you clear about the same?
30/10/23, 8:50 pm - +263 77 989 8389: My name is Dylan Mafemera an Zimbabwean international, the course I would do is B. Tech Civil Engineering through Edoofa. This will be in India. The average cost for studies in India is around 2000-3000 without scholarship. 350 usd is the amount to be paid but categorised in to 2 ways 200 in 7 days then 150 in 30 days
30/10/23, 9:19 pm - Austin#276: Please address the remaining questions too
30/10/23, 9:40 pm - +263 77 989 8389: The said Earn While Learning Program is a program which Edoofa can create as an opportunity to Edoofans students. This opportunity can helps the students for fees. The companies will pay an amount after the student work and this will be paid to the university where the student is and this reduces pressure to the parents or guardians example : the company can pay 100 then multiply by 12 then subtract from the total fees charged. After receiving offer letter from the university yes the applicant has to pay the amount mentioned.

My apologies for the delay in replying back, we discussed over and over again but we came up with an answer which somehow can not been accepted. According to our finances right now we have nothing since we are to pay rentals which is 250 usd again paying fees for the little sister of Dylan which is 30usd again we are now budgeting 350usd for his exams registration fees which will be paid somewhere in February 2024. So may the Edoofa group of people understand that and with any chance to give Dylan another chance.

All I have, I thank you,

Mr Mafemera
