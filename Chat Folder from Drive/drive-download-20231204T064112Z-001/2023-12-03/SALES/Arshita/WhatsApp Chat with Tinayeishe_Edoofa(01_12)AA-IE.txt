01/12/23, 12:43 pm - Arshita: Tinayeishe, It is good to see that you have taken the time to learn about the program and fill out the application form to apply. Can you please tell me: 

1)  *What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?*

2) *What are your understandings of the program as per your discussions with Anotidaishe?*
01/12/23, 1:22 pm - +263 78 790 1774: I want to study in India so that l can develop in my studies and l also want a scholarship
01/12/23, 1:28 pm - +263 78 790 1774: My understandingz of the program as per my discussions wth Anotidaishe are as follows :

He taught me that the Edoofa Program is an International Education Scholarship Program that has its mission to make its students- us EDOOFIANS, Employable. And they do it by their EWYL program. As a part of this program, we Edoofians get the opportunity to learn and enhance our skills by working on real-time projects that we get from industry leaders.  The most interesting part about this program is that as a part of this program, we can self-finance our education over and above the scholarship that we have gotten based on our merit.
01/12/23, 2:04 pm - Arshita: Good to know about your understanding
01/12/23, 2:04 pm - Arshita: Let me elaborate you about the program
01/12/23, 2:04 pm - Arshita: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
01/12/23, 2:04 pm - Arshita: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa.
