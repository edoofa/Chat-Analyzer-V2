02/12/23, 11:41 am - Arshita: That is well noted
02/12/23, 11:41 am - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. 

I hope you are confident about achieving it.
02/12/23, 11:43 am - +263 77 300 0978: Yes I'm it can be achieved

02/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 300 0978: I discovered that India is  growing interms of education
02/12/23, 6:30 pm - Arshita: Let us connect at  *12:30 pm CAT on Monday(04/12/23) to resume your session (In case you have any challenges or lessons, you can let me know and we will plan accordingly)*

Please note that your participation and activeness an important parameters of evaluation. If the applicant is occupied with lessons, parents can initiate on their behalf.
