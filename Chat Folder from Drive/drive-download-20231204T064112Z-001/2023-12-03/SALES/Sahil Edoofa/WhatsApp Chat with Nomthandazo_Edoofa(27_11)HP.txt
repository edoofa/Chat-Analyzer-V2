27/11/23, 4:08 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Moyo, now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
27/11/23, 4:08 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
27/11/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 512 2044: Ok thank you madam your assistance would be greatly appreciated
27/11/23, 4:20 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
27/11/23, 4:20 pm - Harmehak: Alright so Mrs Moyo, before we proceed ahead, I would like to know you and Mr Moyo better as parents. 

Kindly go ahead, share a bit with us about yourself, what do you do, what is your highest qualification, and what motivates you to support your child ahead for education?
27/11/23, 4:42 pm - +263 77 512 2044: Ok l am a mother of 3 age 55 yrs not employed ..I did O level but did not pass .Nomthandazo is our last born as for Mr Moyo, he is a carpenter self employed we struggle to pay fees due to economic hardships but we would like our daughter Nomthandazo to study further because she is passionate and determined when it comes to education
27/11/23, 4:50 pm - Harmehak: Well received Mrs Moyo, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself please.

May I know more about your elder children please?
27/11/23, 4:54 pm - +263 77 512 2044: My first born is a daughter is a 32 yr old ,married and is a teacher and my second born is a son 26 yrs old and is unemployed
27/11/23, 4:57 pm - Harmehak: It's a pleasure to know about them please.
27/11/23, 4:57 pm - Harmehak: You and Mr Moyo have surely lead a wonderful family.
27/11/23, 4:58 pm - Harmehak: I would like to know Nomthandazo better as a student.

How she is at school, her interests and hobbies along with what exactly would she like to study?
27/11/23, 5:16 pm - +263 77 512 2044: She is very serious about getting educated as a girl child. She loves school and is a very good leader, she also plays netball at school. Her dream is to study medicine and become a doctor one day
27/11/23, 5:53 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful,

It's a pleasure to know more about her!
27/11/23, 5:53 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
27/11/23, 7:13 pm - +263 77 512 2044: I'm very confident in my daughter
27/11/23, 7:31 pm - Harmehak: That's great
27/11/23, 7:34 pm - +263 77 512 2044: Thank you
27/11/23, 7:36 pm - Harmehak: May I know her O level results and A level subject combination please?
27/11/23, 7:40 pm - +263 77 512 2044: She has 8 O level subjects including Maths,Chemistry and combined science now she is doing Maths Biology and Chemistry at A level
27/11/23, 7:43 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please,

Why didn't she happen to pursue Physics as well in her A level, Mrs Moyo?

I believe it's an important science subject, wouldn't you agree?
27/11/23, 7:47 pm - +263 77 512 2044: Yes I agree but she didn't pass the subject at O level that's why she is not doing physics at A level
27/11/23, 7:53 pm - Harmehak: I can understand!
27/11/23, 7:53 pm - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
27/11/23, 8:05 pm - +263 77 512 2044: So if she's not doing physics, is she still able to medicine by any chance maybe
27/11/23, 8:05 pm - +263 77 512 2044: do medicine *
27/11/23, 8:30 pm - Harmehak: I would have loved to continue however I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 12 PM CAT*, as my working hours are over and it's already been a long day, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.* <This message was edited>

28/11/23, 1:59 pm - Harmehak: Anything else that you would like to ask please?
28/11/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 512 2044: Which are other courses that are available which are not in the health sector
28/11/23, 2:40 pm - Harmehak: I would need to know her interests for the same please.
28/11/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 512 2044: Ok it's just that she always spoke about how she would like to become a psychologist or maybe a psychiatrist  but I'm sure she can choose amongst the ones available
28/11/23, 2:55 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please,

She can surely pursue Bachelors in Psychology as well in that regard.
28/11/23, 2:55 pm - Harmehak: Is she available for a discussion?

30/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 71 814 6129: This is motivating
30/11/23, 3:02 pm - Harmehak: Wonderful,

Did the resources encourage you more about India, Nomthandazo?
30/11/23, 3:03 pm - +263 71 814 6129: Yes and it shows the excellence of India very well
30/11/23, 3:04 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Nomthandazo 

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
30/11/23, 3:06 pm - +263 71 814 6129: No we have no idea
30/11/23, 3:07 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
30/11/23, 3:07 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
30/11/23, 3:07 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
30/11/23, 3:07 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
30/11/23, 3:07 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 3:12 pm - +263 71 814 6129: Edoofa is very helpful to students like me who cannot afford such amounts of money
30/11/23, 3:17 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
30/11/23, 3:19 pm - +263 71 814 6129: It's a very good program that helps in a big way
30/11/23, 3:52 pm - Harmehak: That's great
30/11/23, 3:53 pm - Harmehak: Nomthandazo, from Mr Piyush's experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
30/11/23, 5:36 pm - +263 71 814 6129: Yes I agree
30/11/23, 5:36 pm - Harmehak: That's great

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program and how it would be assisting you further.
30/11/23, 5:36 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
30/11/23, 5:36 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
30/11/23, 5:36 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

30/11/23, 5:36 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 5:42 pm - +263 71 814 6129: So EWYL program helps earn money while learning?
30/11/23, 5:43 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, Nomthandazo
30/11/23, 5:44 pm - +263 71 814 6129: Ok I understand
30/11/23, 5:44 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
30/11/23, 5:54 pm - +263 71 814 6129: Ok ma'am
30/11/23, 5:55 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

30/11/23, 6:19 pm - +263 71 814 6129: Does edoofa by any chance provide 100% scholarships
30/11/23, 6:20 pm - Harmehak: May I know your understanding of a 100% scholarship, Nomthandazo?
30/11/23, 6:23 pm - +263 71 814 6129: I think it's the one that covers everything including accommodation, living expenses, and tution fees
30/11/23, 6:24 pm - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
30/11/23, 6:26 pm - +263 71 814 6129: I now understand ma'am thank you
30/11/23, 6:27 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please,

Do you have any other queries?
30/11/23, 6:27 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1500-$1900*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
30/11/23, 6:30 pm - +263 71 814 6129: I will definitely work hard to get 90-100% scholarship because it would be very helpful
30/11/23, 6:30 pm - +263 71 814 6129: No
30/11/23, 6:31 pm - Harmehak: Thats wonderful, please!
30/11/23, 6:32 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
30/11/23, 6:33 pm - +263 71 814 6129: Yes
30/11/23, 6:37 pm - Harmehak: Nomthandazo, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
30/11/23, 6:37 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
30/11/23, 6:41 pm - +263 71 814 6129: About 1500-2250
30/11/23, 6:43 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
30/11/23, 6:43 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 6:43 pm - Harmehak: You see, Nomthandazo, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
30/11/23, 6:45 pm - +263 71 814 6129: Yes it's good
30/11/23, 6:48 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
30/11/23, 6:48 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
30/11/23, 6:48 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
30/11/23, 6:51 pm - +263 71 814 6129: I am understanding ma'am
30/11/23, 6:52 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
30/11/23, 6:52 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 6:52 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
30/11/23, 6:52 pm - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
30/11/23, 6:52 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
30/11/23, 6:56 pm - +263 71 814 6129: Yes I understood
30/11/23, 6:57 pm - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
30/11/23, 6:57 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 6:57 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
30/11/23, 6:57 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
30/11/23, 6:57 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

30/11/23, 7:00 pm - Harmehak: Do connect your parents with Mrs Ruth as well, Nomthandazo
30/11/23, 7:01 pm - +263 71 814 6129: Ok I will ma'am
30/11/23, 7:03 pm - +263 71 814 6129: Is it possible to continue with the conversation later ma'am, there is no electricity this side
30/11/23, 7:03 pm - Harmehak: We have concluded our discussion itself, please
30/11/23, 7:04 pm - +263 71 814 6129: Thank you so much for the information you provided
30/11/23, 7:04 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome
30/11/23, 7:05 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
30/11/23, 7:05 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
30/11/23, 7:05 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

01/12/23, 11:52 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good Morning Nomthandazo Moyo , Mr.Elphas Moyo and Mrs.Thenjiwe Moyo

*I am Sahil, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa* , and I trust you are doing well.

First and foremost, allow me to extend my warm congratulations to you for successfully completing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program. I hope your recent session with *Ms.Harmehak* was enlightening and provided you with a deeper understanding of our program. I've been closely reviewing your responses from your counseling session, and I trust you've taken the time to revisit the session with your family members.

Now, as we move forward, I will be your guiding light through the eligibility check stage, ensuring that all your queries and concerns are addressed.
*Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?*

01/12/23, 4:02 pm - Sahil Edoofa: ​​May I know what all did you happen to discuss with your family members, and what all would they like to ask from the entire process?

01/12/23, 4:41 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents had the chance to connect with Mrs. Ruth? Were you able to discuss all your queries and gain insights into her journey with Edoofa? As a single parent of two daughters and a small-scale farmer, how did she successfully manage her responsibilities? Additionally, how did Edoofa assist her in overcoming any challenges she encountered, and what was her experience throughout the process?
01/12/23, 4:50 pm - +263 77 512 2044: We had not yet contacted her but we will definitely contact her now
01/12/23, 4:57 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Do it today
01/12/23, 4:57 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
01/12/23, 4:58 pm - +263 77 512 2044: Yes I have already contacted her

01/12/23, 5:05 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>

02/12/23, 3:09 pm - +263 71 814 6129: Yes we can. I apologise for being late
02/12/23, 3:48 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your provisional offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
02/12/23, 5:05 pm - +263 71 814 6129: 1. I would like to study cardiovascular technology
2. India
3. $6000 - $8000 a year

02/12/23, 5:07 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Are parents ready for the same ?
02/12/23, 5:10 pm - +263 71 814 6129: Yes my mother agrees however my father is currently unavailable due to work
02/12/23, 5:11 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you discussed with him ?
02/12/23, 5:14 pm - +263 71 814 6129: Yes I have and he sounded positive
02/12/23, 5:14 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can they acknowledge in this group ?
02/12/23, 5:16 pm - +263 71 814 6129: Yes they can
02/12/23, 5:17 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Waiting
02/12/23, 5:19 pm - +263 77 512 2044: Hello sir i am Nomthandazo's mother
02/12/23, 5:21 pm - Sahil Edoofa: @263775122044 Are you ready for the same ?
02/12/23, 5:22 pm - +263 77 512 2044: Yes I am
02/12/23, 5:23 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
02/12/23, 5:23 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
02/12/23, 5:23 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
02/12/23, 5:23 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/12/23, 5:23 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 7 th  or 8 th December 2023 for $200 and the  7 th  or 8 th of January  for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 7th  or 8th December 2023. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
02/12/23, 5:32 pm - +263 77 512 2044: Currently sir I'm not financially prepared as I don't have enough money at the moment but given more time I will be able to come up with it. I surely want my daughter to be part of the Edoofa scholarship program.
02/12/23, 5:33 pm - Sahil Edoofa: What challenges are you facing can you elaborate ?
02/12/23, 5:37 pm - +263 77 512 2044: Currently we are facing expenses for her A level exams which she still has to  register for and these are very expensive considering that the only working person in the house is my husband.
02/12/23, 5:45 pm - Sahil Edoofa: How would you want me help you in this situation please considering we only have limited seats
02/12/23, 5:50 pm - +263 77 512 2044: I was thinking maybe we can pay for her reservation seat sometime next year since she will be going for higher education in 2025 when her results are out. What do you suggest sir?
02/12/23, 5:54 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Seats are being reserved in advance due to the multi-step process involved in studying abroad. The reservation process for 2025 will conclude by the end of this month.

02/12/23, 6:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Nomthandazo's admission is for August 2025 Intake. Let me share with you for all the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake. Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways

1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:- Having a head start that too of more than 20 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.

Giving you an example, Persistance Muza the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself. 

This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.

2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:- Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels. 

3,  Having the benefit of the Community:- This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.

02/12/23, 6:12 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I truly understand that making sacrifices initially can be challenging, but it's an investment in your child's future. From my experience, I've witnessed countless families facing similar challenges at the start, and eventually, it transformed not just their child's life but the lives of future generations. This could be a life-changing opportunity for your child, and I encourage you to consider it as a valuable investment in their future.
