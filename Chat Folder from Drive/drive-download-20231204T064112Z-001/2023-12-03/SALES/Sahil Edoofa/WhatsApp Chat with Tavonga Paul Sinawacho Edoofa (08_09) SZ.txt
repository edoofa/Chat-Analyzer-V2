11/09/23, 11:06 am - +263 71 994 5500: Okay
11/09/23, 11:07 am - +91 82875 72068: Phenomenal! Based on the information that I have propagated earlier may I know what is your knowledge or understanding about the *Edoofa Scholarship Program*, please?
11/09/23, 11:09 am - +263 71 994 5500: It's a scholarship program that is based on offering quality education to the African student
11/09/23, 11:28 am - +91 82875 72068: You really have a good grasp of the program, but I'll explain it further.

The *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is an innovative initiative spearheaded by Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. as part of the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) program. This program aims to address the challenges of affordability and employability in higher education by empowering students to both earn scholarship credits and acquire essential 21st-century job skills. Through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, deserving students, known as Edoofians, can avail themselves of scholarships ranging from 50% to 100%, enabling them to pursue their desired courses while actively engaging in live projects that contribute to their scholarship credits. This approach particularly assists African students in self-financing their education.

In essence, the Edoofa Program, through its SEELS initiative, acts as a bridge between financial assistance, college education, and the enhancement of employability skills.
11/09/23, 11:28 am - +91 82875 72068: It's worth noting that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is highly competitive, with approximately 50,000 applicants vying for just 1,500 scholarship positions. Given this intense competition, our conversation will be far from ordinary – I'll be guiding you towards readiness for the Eligibility Check Interview. As your counselor, we'll delve into your application details, including your chosen course, preferred country for education, financial considerations, university options, and more. Following our discussions, you'll proceed with the Eligibility Procedures, which encompass a scholarship test and an interview with the Program Manager.

Successfully navigating these Eligibility Check Procedures is essential to secure your qualification for the scholarship. Are you prepared to compete?
11/09/23, 11:52 am - +263 71 994 5500: Okay am understanding the concept

12/09/23, 3:21 pm - +263 71 994 5500: Okay sir I have understood the course it is a very good course
12/09/23, 3:21 pm - +263 71 994 5500: I would like to pursue it
12/09/23, 3:22 pm - +91 82875 72068: So does the course align with your career aspirations?
12/09/23, 3:24 pm - +263 71 994 5500: Yes it aligns because right now I'm do business studies right now
12/09/23, 4:24 pm - +91 82875 72068: Not to worry Tavonga! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
12/09/23, 4:24 pm - +91 82875 72068: <Media omitted>
12/09/23, 4:24 pm - +91 82875 72068: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
12/09/23, 4:40 pm - +263 71 994 5500: I think it is affordable for my family
12/09/23, 4:46 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well moving on, we have familiarized ourselves with the economic condition of African nations and we offer something special and extremely valuable to our *Edoofians*. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.

Sounds impressive? Do you have any idea how that's done?
12/09/23, 4:47 pm - +263 71 994 5500: I don't have idea how it works
12/09/23, 4:49 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, Tavonga. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
12/09/23, 4:49 pm - +91 82875 72068: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
12/09/23, 4:49 pm - +91 82875 72068: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
12/09/23, 4:49 pm - +91 82875 72068: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
12/09/23, 4:49 pm - +91 82875 72068: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
12/09/23, 4:49 pm - +91 82875 72068: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
12/09/23, 5:00 pm - +263 71 994 5500: So the EWYL program will be paying that 2000 to 3000 fee ?
12/09/23, 5:05 pm - +91 82875 72068: The program gives an equal opportunity to every student to self-finance their own education through the *Earn While You Learn* program and there is no upper limit for the credits. However, if a student is not able to use the EWYL program to the maximum, the student will have to bear a certain amount of fees that we will discuss as the session progresses
12/09/23, 5:11 pm - +263 71 994 5500: Ok it cover that 2000 -3000 fee you have mentioned above
12/09/23, 5:16 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, Tavonga, benefiting from the *Earn While You Learn* program depends on the student's diligence. However, while the parents are responsible for the remaining fees if the student demonstrates exceptional dedication and effort, they have the opportunity to self-finance a significant portion of the fees.
12/09/23, 5:18 pm - +263 71 994 5500: Can you estimate the significant portion of the fee
12/09/23, 5:31 pm - +263 71 994 5500: Ok
12/09/23, 7:07 pm - +91 82875 72068: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so let us connect at 10:00 am CAT tomorrow to resume your session ( *Incase you are facing any challenges, please let me know the time you will be available and we will schedule accordingly* )

Please note that your participation and activeness is an important parameter of evaluation.

13/09/23, 11:44 am - +263 71 994 5500: I now understand the EWYL
13/09/23, 11:51 am - +91 82875 72068: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
13/09/23, 11:51 am - +91 82875 72068: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
13/09/23, 11:51 am - +91 82875 72068: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
13/09/23, 1:49 pm - +263 71 994 5500: Higher education concierge and Earn while you learn program
13/09/23, 1:50 pm - +91 82875 72068: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect after 60 minutes for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule. 

Meanwhile, you can go through our Social Media page to learn more about the experiences of Edoofians and the program!

13/09/23, 4:40 pm - +263 71 994 5500: Will continue tomorrow my phone's battery is about to die
13/09/23, 4:41 pm - +91 82875 72068: I can understand Tavonga. However, I would request you to be active for the next 30 minutes as we are about to conclude the session.
13/09/23, 4:42 pm - +263 71 994 5500: Ok sir
13/09/23, 4:42 pm - +91 82875 72068: Now I know you focus more on affordability and employability. So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
13/09/23, 4:44 pm - +263 71 994 5500: My family supports me because they also want me to aquire quality education
13/09/23, 4:46 pm - +91 82875 72068: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
13/09/23, 4:46 pm - +91 82875 72068: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
13/09/23, 4:48 pm - +263 71 994 5500: The qualifications documents
The I'd card 
Passport
13/09/23, 4:49 pm - +91 82875 72068: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
13/09/23, 4:50 pm - +91 82875 72068: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
13/09/23, 4:50 pm - +91 82875 72068: <Media omitted>
13/09/23, 4:50 pm - +91 82875 72068: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
13/09/23, 4:55 pm - +263 71 994 5500: Okay I understand it very well sir
13/09/23, 4:58 pm - +91 82875 72068: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
13/09/23, 5:02 pm - +263 71 994 5500: Okay sir it's a very good 
I now understand
13/09/23, 5:05 pm - +91 82875 72068: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
13/09/23, 5:11 pm - +263 71 994 5500: Okay it very  flexible
13/09/23, 5:11 pm - +91 82875 72068: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
13/09/23, 6:44 pm - +263 71 994 5500: Very sorry my phone's battery was dead
13/09/23, 6:47 pm - +263 71 994 5500: According to what I understood  , firstly before I come to my parents should pay 350 dollar for Edoofa to find an University for me and then I will start my EWLY program to cover the fees before I come there
13/09/23, 6:48 pm - +263 71 994 5500: Before coming to India
13/09/23, 6:51 pm - +91 82875 72068: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
13/09/23, 6:52 pm - +263 71 994 5500: I we are at the same page
13/09/23, 6:59 pm - +91 82875 72068: <Media omitted>
13/09/23, 8:22 pm - +91 82875 72068: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for tomorrow at 10:00 AM CAT as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation

13/09/23, 9:21 pm - +263 71 994 5500: Am at stage one
14/09/23, 10:14 am - +91 82875 72068: Good Morning,

*”Nobody is built like you. You design yourself” - Shawn Corey Carter*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
14/09/23, 10:31 am - +263 71 994 5500: Yes am ready
14/09/23, 11:26 am - +91 82875 72068: That is good to know, Tavonga. I hope you are having a marvelous day!
14/09/23, 11:26 am - +91 82875 72068: Well, we are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
14/09/23, 11:35 am - +263 71 994 5500: Yes explain to I really want to be an Efoofian
14/09/23, 11:53 am - +91 82875 72068: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$750) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$750) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
14/09/23, 12:04 pm - +263 71 994 5500: Yes the process is clear
14/09/23, 12:06 pm - +91 82875 72068: Is there anything else you would like to inquire about or any other questions I can help you with?
14/09/23, 12:12 pm - +263 71 994 5500: Can you explain further on the registration fee
14/09/23, 12:22 pm - +91 82875 72068: This registration fee($500-$750) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
14/09/23, 12:33 pm - +91 82875 72068: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect after 60 minutes for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule.

14/09/23, 1:50 pm - +91 82875 72068: A very pleasant afternoon to everyone. I am done with my lunch. Thank you for your patience.
14/09/23, 1:55 pm - +263 71 994 5500: Okay I understand
14/09/23, 1:59 pm - +91 82875 72068: May I ask whether you have other queries that I can answer?
14/09/23, 2:00 pm - +263 71 994 5500: Can you clarify on the Visa and the Air ticket
14/09/23, 2:00 pm - +263 71 994 5500: To India
14/09/23, 2:03 pm - +91 82875 72068: If you understand the concept of International Education, the finances that play a major role is not visa fee or flight ticket because visa fee is given once in the whole program and the flight ticket is taken a limited number of times,maybe twice or once,because international students don't often travel back to their country.

They look forward to settling down and making sure education is not hampered.So they learn and do internships at breaks.But still students can definitely visit their family during holidays and spend time with them.

But I personally have seen that students don't travel often,so considering these the traveling fee
*(air fare :-around $400,Visa fee:-$83) is to be borne by the student* which is mostly a one time investment.
14/09/23, 2:05 pm - +263 71 994 5500: Okay
14/09/23, 2:07 pm - +263 71 994 5500: So when I'm coming there for the first time am I going to pay my own Air ticket or Edoofa will do that for me
14/09/23, 2:27 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, Tavonga, it is to be borne by the student.
14/09/23, 3:52 pm - +263 71 994 5500: Ok I understand
14/09/23, 3:52 pm - +263 71 994 5500: We can proceed
14/09/23, 3:55 pm - +91 82875 72068: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
14/09/23, 3:56 pm - +91 82875 72068: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

14/09/23, 4:11 pm - +91 82875 72068: Certainly, Tavonga.
14/09/23, 4:11 pm - +91 82875 72068: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session. I appreciate your activeness throughout the session. Now before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family
14/09/23, 4:11 pm - +91 82875 72068: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*
14/09/23, 4:12 pm - +91 82875 72068: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experience

How are you doing today?
25/09/23, 2:04 pm - +263 71 994 5500: Very sorry sir my network is very bad
25/09/23, 2:09 pm - Sahil Edoofa: : I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
25/09/23, 2:09 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.

Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
25/09/23, 2:09 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/09/23, 2:10 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/09/23, 2:10 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 29th or 30th September 2023 for $200 and the 29th or 30th of October for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 29th or 30th of September 2023.
 Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
