Can you please tell me:
1)  *What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?*
2) *What is your understanding of the program as per your discussions with Persistance?*
16/10/23, 10:58 am - +263 77 113 6912: 1) I applied for this scholarship because I would kindly like to further my education
16/10/23, 11:01 am - +263 77 113 6912: 2) From what I discussed with Persistence I have come to learn that this program will help me contain the powerful weapon which can be used in the world which is ‘ Education’

16/10/23, 11:09 am - Sagar: *So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program*

Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
16/10/23, 11:09 am - Sagar: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.

16/10/23, 8:07 pm - Sagar: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you.

16/10/23, 8:24 pm - +263 77 113 6912: Thank you <This message was edited>
16/10/23, 8:25 pm - Sagar: May I know if you understood everything properly?
16/10/23, 8:26 pm - +263 77 113 6912: Yes i have understood evrythng
16/10/23, 8:29 pm - Sagar: Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
16/10/23, 8:30 pm - +263 77 113 6912: Please do share the information
16/10/23, 8:33 pm - Sagar: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.
16/10/23, 8:33 pm - Sagar: Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 13 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
16/10/23, 8:33 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
16/10/23, 8:36 pm - +263 77 113 6912: Ohhh okay thank you
16/10/23, 8:38 pm - Sagar: Well Please I would like you to be informed that the University evaluates the scholarship amount basis on the following points.

1. Academic 
2. Merit
3. Extra-Curricular Activities. 
4. Statement of purpose.
5. Recommendation from Edoofa.
16/10/23, 8:39 pm - Sagar: To further Add on the Point 5th Mentioned above
 *Recommendation from Edoofa*

In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
16/10/23, 8:42 pm - +263 77 113 6912: Okay thank you 

It is really reasonable
16/10/23, 8:50 pm - Sagar: *Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?*
16/10/23, 8:59 pm - +263 77 113 6912: Yes please thank you
16/10/23, 9:00 pm - Sagar: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
16/10/23, 9:00 pm - Sagar: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
16/10/23, 9:02 pm - +263 77 113 6912: Ohhh okay 
I understand
16/10/23, 9:04 pm - Sagar: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
16/10/23, 9:04 pm - Sagar: *1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics

*3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
* Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

16/10/23, 9:04 pm - Sagar: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
16/10/23, 9:06 pm - +263 77 113 6912: I think it is highky beneficial
16/10/23, 9:06 pm - Sagar: I am delighted to hear that, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
16/10/23, 9:06 pm - Sagar: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

16/10/23, 9:06 pm - Sagar: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
16/10/23, 11:12 pm - Sagar: @263771136912 are we connected?
16/10/23, 11:23 pm - Sagar: I was expecting your response but it's been quite a day, and my work hours have come to a close. Let's pick up where we left off tomorrow at 10 AM CAT with fresh energy and ideas.

Have a restful night,
Blessings to you!

17/10/23, 10:01 am - Sagar: Good Morning, Everyone!

*"What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals"*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
17/10/23, 10:02 am - +263 77 113 6912: Good morning 
Sorry this side we having powercuts problems due to rain
17/10/23, 10:06 am - Sagar: I can understand, Chantelle!
17/10/23, 10:06 am - Sagar: I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
17/10/23, 10:08 am - +263 77 113 6912: Yes i do understand and it is exactly what i was looking for regarding my international education
17/10/23, 10:15 am - Sagar: I am delighted to know that you have been looking for the same.
17/10/23, 10:15 am - Sagar: Alright, basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
17/10/23, 10:21 am - +263 77 113 6912: I am ready
17/10/23, 10:23 am - Sagar: Chantelle, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
17/10/23, 10:25 am - +263 77 113 6912: Between $1500-$2250
17/10/23, 11:10 am - Sagar: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
17/10/23, 11:10 am - Sagar: <Media omitted>
17/10/23, 11:23 am - +263 77 113 6912: Wooow nice
17/10/23, 11:27 am - +263 77 113 6912: That is nice
17/10/23, 11:36 am - Sagar: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.

Don’t you think so?
17/10/23, 12:05 pm - +263 77 113 6912: Yeah thts true
17/10/23, 12:05 pm - +263 77 113 6912: So for me which results will I be using to enrol
17/10/23, 12:13 pm - Sagar: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
17/10/23, 12:14 pm - Sagar: Chantelle, your A level results will be taken into consideration!
17/10/23, 12:14 pm - Sagar: Chantelle, basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
17/10/23, 12:14 pm - Sagar: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
17/10/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 113 6912: Okay thank you <This message was edited>
17/10/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 113 6912: Okay
17/10/23, 1:53 pm - Sagar: I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
17/10/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 113 6912: Yes I do understand
17/10/23, 1:59 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
17/10/23, 1:59 pm - Sagar: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
17/10/23, 1:59 pm - Sagar: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
17/10/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 113 6912: Yes i have
17/10/23, 2:10 pm - Sagar: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
17/10/23, 2:10 pm - Sagar: So let me tell you that the next step After you are done interacting with the university you will receive your offer letter( UNIVERSITY ACCEPTANCE LETTER) from the university where your fee and scholarship will be mentioned and the university will give you a few week's time to make the payment of registration fee. Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. The first part will be paid in Coming few months of (2024-2025).
17/10/23, 2:10 pm - Sagar: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
17/10/23, 2:10 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
17/10/23, 2:15 pm - +263 77 113 6912: So how much will be the visa
17/10/23, 2:15 pm - +263 77 113 6912: Okay
17/10/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 709 4061: This message was deleted
17/10/23, 2:40 pm - Sagar: If you understand the concept of international education finances that play a major role are not visa fees and flight tickets. The flight ticket is required a very limited number of times as the students don't travel that often. I don't mean to say that students can not go back to their country, they can definitely go back to enjoy the holidays. What I have personally seen is, the students do not travel that often.
So, considering the main finance which plays the most important role in international education is the annual fees. So, to reduce this annual fee, edoofa helps a student with the Earn While You Learn Program. This program provides the students with an opportunity to earn scholarship credits which in return help them to make their education more affordable.
Visa fees and flight tickets are to be bought just a month before they plan to come to India. So, let's say the student wants to come to India in August 2024, This means that his family has to cover the Visa fee and the ticket in July 2024. If you understand the concept properly, till July 2024, the student will be working in the Earn While You Learn program and will be earning Scholarship credits. Now, with this opportunity, you can save a lot of money on the annual fee which in return helps you to make your flight ticket and the Visa fee affordable.

As mentioned to you already, the scholarship covers the tuition fees as you see, the Edoofa scholarship is basically the scholarship seats acquired from the universities for their good work in the past 14 years in the higher education space. So the travel costs will have to be covered by the student, But our admission team assist you in all the steps. So that you get the cheapest air travel tickets and also acquire the visa with ease.
The cost for both the visa and flight cost will be around $400-$600, But you need not worry about that yet as you will be coming to India in the month of July-August next year as per your preperations
17/10/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 113 6912: Ohhh okay thank you
17/10/23, 2:56 pm - Sagar: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
17/10/23, 2:56 pm - Sagar: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
17/10/23, 2:56 pm - Sagar: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

08/11/23, 12:26 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *@263777094117* Please note that the number of scholarship seats is limited in number, and in case *Chantelle* is selected for the scholarship we expect that you are clear and aware of all the details shared during the session along with that you also obey the rules and honour the scholarship terms.  

In case you do not follow these terms then *Chantelle's* entire scholarship process will go into backlog and you will only be able to apply for the scholarship after 6 months. By then the entire fee structure for the scholarship program may increase*.
08/11/23, 12:26 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Ideally, as you know, the tentative dates are:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the *15th or 16th of November 2023* for $200 and the *15th or 16th of December 2023* for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the *15th or 16th of November 2023*

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?

22/11/23, 5:37 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.

23/11/23, 9:52 am - +263 73 565 5619: Dear sir 
Firstly , in zimbabwe we are facing an economy challenge that have also affected and strained our companies leading to them failing to meet and pay our  salaries and wages 
I have not received my salaries for the previous three months
Also to add , my mother is seriously ill and this has affected our family both emmotionally and financially mainly as she is still under treatment 

I hope you understand and help me find a way for the payment plan for the scholarship
23/11/23, 10:21 am - Shubham Madhwal: As a Senior Academician at the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I am here to offer you comprehensive support in planning for your child's education and guide you through the details of our scholarship program. We understand that ensuring your child receives a quality education is a significant financial commitment, and we are here to help you make informed decisions for Chantelle's brighter future.
23/11/23, 10:21 am - Shubham Madhwal: Mrs Garaba with all due respect I understand your situation, honestly, there are certain instances in our life which are beyond our control, and in fact, we as human beings cannot plan for them as well.
23/11/23, 10:22 am - Shubham Madhwal: I am sure you as her parents,  you wouldn't have planned for such events and I can understand that your priority shifted from Chantelle's Higher Education towards your mother's medications.
23/11/23, 10:22 am - Shubham Madhwal: As your child's academician, I am here to help you out, you see, in such instances, even the Board understands that the situation is beyond an applicant's control and if given a chance, they might be able to get hold of the situation with proper assistance and planning.
23/11/23, 10:23 am - Shubham Madhwal: I am sure you would like me to help you out with a financial plan which might help you in maintaining the priority of your healthcare while ensuring that it is not at the cost of Chatntelle's bright future, isn't it?
23/11/23, 10:35 am - +263 73 565 5619: Thank you for understanding sir
23/11/23, 11:18 am - Shubham Madhwal: I am sure you would like me to help you out with a financial plan which might help you in maintaining the priority of your healthcare while ensuring that it is not at the cost of Chatntelle's bright future, isn't it?
23/11/23, 12:07 pm - +263 73 565 5619: Yes it is
23/11/23, 12:46 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Mrs Garaba as you know due to the acting policies and standards of the Academic Board the Board is not viable to change the 7-day deadline period. However, after careful consideration, they are willing to consider your situation and since Chantelle has cleared the required set of eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, you would have to *complete a part fee of $100 by Friday, Ie 29th of November*.
23/11/23, 12:46 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You would have time till the 29th of  December, to complete another $100, and then the pending amount of $150 is to be paid in the next 20 days which would be around the 15th of December 2023.  All in all, for $350 you will have about 55 days to complete the formalities.

Considering your situation, I believe this financial plan would be convenient for you and your family, please?
