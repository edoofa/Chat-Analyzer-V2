*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
24/11/23, 4:22 pm - +263 78 092 6205: Good day
24/11/23, 4:23 pm - +263 78 092 6205: Yes this is Bradley
25/11/23, 9:13 am - Sagar: Good Morning Bradely,
It is a pleasure to connect with you today,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
25/11/23, 9:53 am - +263 78 092 6205: Okay good morning
25/11/23, 10:03 am - +258 84 052 7943: What is going on here
25/11/23, 10:12 am - Sagar: It is a pleasure connecting with you Mr.Aldridge Weale,
This is a group made for Bradley's counselling session for the Edoofa scholarship program, your son has filled out the form for the program, and you can confirm the same with him. <This message was edited>
25/11/23, 10:18 am - +258 84 052 7943: Lets go ahead
25/11/23, 10:25 am - Sagar: Mr.Weale, I would like to know if you know anything about the program?
25/11/23, 10:33 am - +258 84 052 7943: Honestly, I don't... Please advise
25/11/23, 10:40 am - Sagar: Let me brief you about the program.
25/11/23, 10:40 am - Sagar: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
25/11/23, 10:41 am - Sagar: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
25/11/23, 10:41 am - Sagar: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
25/11/23, 10:41 am - Sagar: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
25/11/23, 4:56 pm - Sagar: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 9:00 AM. Please be online during your session time!

In the meantime please go through the links I am sharing for a better understanding of the program

27/11/23, 10:02 am - Sagar: Alright so Bradley, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
27/11/23, 10:04 am - +258 84 052 7943: Good morning all
27/11/23, 10:22 am - Sagar: Good Morning Mr.Weale.
27/11/23, 10:32 am - +258 84 052 7943: I have gone through your program and would greatly appreciate if you could give my son a chance.
27/11/23, 10:39 am - Sagar: We would also want to give Bradley a chance but to do so can you please ask him to come online so we could finish his counselling session.
27/11/23, 10:41 am - +263 78 092 6205: Okay so I'm Bradley Weale as you know and I was a student at Guinea Fowl High School for 6 years, and I'm currently waiting for my Advanced level results. During my 6 years of high school I've developed into mature and well groomed young man with the help of my parents as well as my teachers. During my two years of Advanced Level I was studying science subjects namely Maths, Chemistry and Physics in hopes of studying engineering when I go to University. I found myself interested in Technical Graphics and Design so I'm good  at drawing and designing technical things. As a school project I once designed a solar panel holder that could fit different solar panels of different lengths and widths. As for hobbies I enjoy listening to music and drawing. We are a family of four and I'm the oldest of two children. My father is currently employed in Mozambique as a boiler maker and my mother is self-employed
27/11/23, 10:44 am - Sagar: Great answer Bradley.
27/11/23, 10:44 am - +263 78 092 6205: Thank you
27/11/23, 10:44 am - Sagar: So Bradley, could you kindly tell me how much *Guinea Fowl High School* charges you every term, who in your family financially supports your education, and what profession they are in?
27/11/23, 10:47 am - +263 78 092 6205: Guinea Fowl High School charges $300 every term and both my parents support my education
27/11/23, 10:50 am - Sagar: Noted.
27/11/23, 10:50 am - Sagar: As you know the evaluation of your application begins in this counseling session, followed by the eligibility check by our Academic Board. We make sure the opportunity is provided to deserving students who are well inclined to their career paths. Therefore our Academic Board would also take the remarks on your academics and extracurriculars from your school, required in the process

Can you please share the name and contact of your School Headmaster/Head Mistress to receive feedback regarding the same?
27/11/23, 10:52 am - +263 78 092 6205: Okay I will
27/11/23, 10:58 am - +263 78 092 6205: Mr Tichaurawa.vcf (file attached)
27/11/23, 11:07 am - Sagar: Noted.
27/11/23, 4:53 pm - Sagar: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
27/11/23, 5:11 pm - +263 78 092 6205: Okay
28/11/23, 8:42 am - Sagar: Good Morning, Everyone!

*"Believe you can and you're halfway there."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
28/11/23, 8:50 am - +263 78 092 6205: Good morning
28/11/23, 8:58 am - Sagar: Alright, let us continue the session.
28/11/23, 8:59 am - Sagar: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study engineering, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
28/11/23, 8:59 am - +263 78 092 6205: Okay
28/11/23, 9:04 am - +263 78 092 6205: I've always found it interesting and and I really like designing things and applying those designs practically seems really interesting

28/11/23, 9:20 am - +258 84 052 7943: Good morning all
28/11/23, 9:23 am - Sagar: Good Morning Mr.Weale.
28/11/23, 9:25 am - +263 78 092 6205: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 9:25 am - Sagar: Noted.
28/11/23, 9:26 am - Sagar: Also, send me Form 5 results.
28/11/23, 9:38 am - +263 78 092 6205: I don't have access to them at the moment
28/11/23, 9:42 am - Sagar: Do you remember them?
28/11/23, 9:58 am - +263 78 092 6205: We didn't write end of term exams but we had progress check tests but they are not recorded officially but I'll find out if the school has a record of then
28/11/23, 10:00 am - +263 78 092 6205: *them
28/11/23, 10:04 am - Sagar: Send them later, just let me know your subject combination.
28/11/23, 10:05 am - +258 84 052 7943: Because of low salaries in government schools the teachers tend to bunk lessons, I had to pay for extra lessons elsewhere for Bradley to be fully prepared for A-level exams
28/11/23, 10:13 am - Sagar: I understand Mr.Weale, as a parent we have to do whatever is needed for our child's success.
28/11/23, 10:14 am - Sagar: Can you please ask Bradley to address this.
28/11/23, 10:16 am - +263 78 092 6205: Maths, Physics and Chemistry
28/11/23, 10:21 am - Sagar: Noted.
28/11/23, 10:22 am - Sagar: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering*
28/11/23, 10:34 am - +263 78 092 6205: Okay thank you
28/11/23, 10:34 am - Sagar: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
28/11/23, 10:36 am - +263 78 092 6205: Okay noted
28/11/23, 10:37 am - Sagar: So now shall I brief you about *B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering*?
28/11/23, 10:43 am - +258 84 052 7943: Yes please
28/11/23, 10:44 am - +263 78 092 6205: Okay
28/11/23, 10:44 am - Sagar: *B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering* is a 4-year undergraduate course

First thing any engineering aspirant considers while choosing a branch in Engineering is placement aspect and the course very well caters to it. A few questions which arise when admissions to engineering colleges commence include the branch in demand, highest paid engineering graduates and others such.  Apart from this palcement criteria, there are some other parameters which should be considered while choosing a discipline like- what are the research opportunities, what is scope of career growth etc.

Mechanical Engineering is the evergreen branch of engineering. Market scenario and demand of engineering graduates change every year but the demand of mechanical engineering degree will never be obsolete. Mechanical engineering graduates can find placements in almost every sector, right from construction sector to steel industry and from automobile to software.
28/11/23, 10:45 am - Sagar: Following are the sub disciplines that are associated with mechanical engineering:

*Production Engineering*
*Industrial Engineering*
*Manufacturing Engineering*
*Automobile Engineering*
*Artificial Intelligence*
28/11/23, 10:45 am - Sagar: The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized sub disciplines are discussed in this section.
28/11/23, 10:45 am - Sagar: *Mechanics* 

Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of forces and their effect upon matter. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and plastic) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics include Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies Dynamics the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations). Mechanics of materials, the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces Kinematics, the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion. Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms. Continuum mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than discrete) Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine
28/11/23, 10:45 am - Sagar: *Mechatronics and Robotics*

Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics. It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems. In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.

Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).

Robots are used extensively in industrial engineering. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.
28/11/23, 10:45 am - Sagar: *Thermodynamics and Thermo-science*

Thermodynamics is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a system. Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy (enthalpy) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.

Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of heat transfer, thermofluids, and energy conversion. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design engines and power plants, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat exchangers, heat sinks, radiators, refrigeration, insulation, and others.
28/11/23, 10:45 am - Sagar: *Design and drafting*

Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.

Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist of spray coatings, surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.

Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).
28/11/23, 11:12 am - +263 78 092 6205: Thank you, I'm going through these points
28/11/23, 11:13 am - Sagar: Noted.
28/11/23, 4:41 pm - Sagar: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

29/11/23, 8:32 am - Sagar: Good Morning, Everyone!

*"Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
29/11/23, 8:59 am - +263 78 092 6205: Good morning
29/11/23, 9:06 am - Sagar: So did you understand the course?
29/11/23, 9:10 am - +263 78 092 6205: Yes I think I did
29/11/23, 9:10 am - Sagar: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
29/11/23, 9:13 am - +263 78 092 6205: Okay
29/11/23, 9:15 am - +258 84 052 7943: Good morning
29/11/23, 9:16 am - Sagar: Good morning Mr.Weale.
29/11/23, 9:20 am - +258 84 052 7943: My wife has asked if you could please include her in the group. In your introduction it appeared as if you had included her but I guess something went wrong
29/11/23, 9:20 am - Sagar: Noted.
29/11/23, 9:21 am - Sagar: I have sent her the invite to this group.
29/11/23, 9:25 am - Sagar added +263 71 532 7755
29/11/23, 9:27 am - +263 71 532 7755: Thanks for the Add have gone through the discussion that went on up until now.
29/11/23, 9:28 am - Sagar: It is a pleasure to connect with you Mrs.Mawuka.
29/11/23, 1:03 pm - Sagar: Please address this.
29/11/23, 1:07 pm - +263 78 092 6205: After going through the notes you submitted for me and doing some additional research on my own, I have become more aware of the job opportunities associated with the B-tech mechanical engineering course


In five years, after graduation I see myself as a young graduate on the job market, with a degree looking for the most suitable job for me. I believe I will have acquired a lot of knowledge and I will have learnt a lot of skills to become the best mechanical engineer I can be, to fulfill my dream. I will have improved my creativity and problem solving skills as well. I will also have learnt some technical skills and I will be able to interact with workmates better. Hopefully I will be able to grow into one of the best mechanical engineers in Africa as well as the world.


I want you acknowledge the fact that if I am lucky enough to get this scholarship, I will be truly grateful of the opportunity you would have provided for me. You will have helped me achieve my dream and I will really appreciate it since my parents are not financially able to take me to an international university
29/11/23, 1:09 pm - Sagar: That is really great Bradley, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
29/11/23, 1:12 pm - +263 78 092 6205: Yes I am
29/11/23, 1:15 pm - Sagar: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
29/11/23, 1:18 pm - +263 78 092 6205: Job opportunities in my country are very low and limiting considering the current economic situation in Zimbabwe and I wouldn't be able to go as far as I would have wanted to.
29/11/23, 1:20 pm - Sagar: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
29/11/23, 1:39 pm - +263 78 092 6205: I would like to empower the future youths who would have taken Science subjects by upgrading their Science labs , buying text books and even  sponsoring apparatus especially at my former High School. There are very few Universities in Zimbabwe that offer Science and Technology programmes so as time goes on and with the correct funding I would  like to open a University that is not only affordable to middle and lower class students but also provides quality education.
29/11/23, 1:42 pm - Sagar: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Bradley, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
29/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 092 6205: Yes you're right but everything starts from humble beginnings
29/11/23, 1:47 pm - Sagar: That is right.
29/11/23, 1:47 pm - Sagar: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
29/11/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 092 6205: For example I can offer to a bursary from High School level to University level, where I don't necessarily have to start my own University
29/11/23, 1:54 pm - Sagar: That is right.
29/11/23, 1:54 pm - Sagar: Please address this.
29/11/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 092 6205: Yes I would like to know why because India shares the same background as most African countries
29/11/23, 2:03 pm - Sagar: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

*Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

29/11/23, 2:08 pm - +263 71 532 7755: This is quit intriguing. Thank you for the opportunity to get to know what you all about.
29/11/23, 2:09 pm - Sagar: So now Mrs.Mawuka, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
29/11/23, 2:14 pm - +263 71 532 7755: No everthing is clear so far. Will go through your  University's Profile that you sent now.
29/11/23, 2:21 pm - Sagar: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
29/11/23, 2:26 pm - +258 84 052 7943: I have no idea, may you please give me an insight.
29/11/23, 2:26 pm - Sagar: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
29/11/23, 2:26 pm - Sagar: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
29/11/23, 2:27 pm - Sagar: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
29/11/23, 2:27 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 2:27 pm - Sagar: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
29/11/23, 2:27 pm - Sagar: In simple words Bradley what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
29/11/23, 2:29 pm - +263 71 532 7755: I have no idea too.. thank you for the information
29/11/23, 2:30 pm - Sagar: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
29/11/23, 2:30 pm - +258 84 052 7943: Please do
29/11/23, 2:30 pm - +263 71 532 7755: Yes please
29/11/23, 2:32 pm - Sagar: Mr.Weale and Mrs.Mawuka, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
29/11/23, 3:27 pm - +258 84 052 7943: An attachment kind of learning is good for the students
29/11/23, 3:32 pm - Sagar: Yes Mr.Weale.
29/11/23, 3:32 pm - Sagar: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
29/11/23, 3:33 pm - Sagar: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
29/11/23, 3:33 pm - Sagar: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

29/11/23, 3:33 pm - Sagar: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
29/11/23, 3:33 pm - Sagar: *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
29/11/23, 4:53 pm - Sagar: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
29/11/23, 4:56 pm - +258 84 052 7943: Thank you for affording us all this information about Edoofians. Looking forward for the continuation tomorrow.
29/11/23, 5:28 pm - +263 71 532 7755: True we are getting to know what you are all about and it's interesting how you have managed to help and empower people from all walks of life....and they are giving back to thier communities and the world. With the internet it's good to see that Edoofians are really changing the world and not just their lives. It's amazing...Thank you...
29/11/23, 5:29 pm - +263 71 532 7755: Thank you God bless
30/11/23, 8:19 am - Sagar: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Education is the key that unlocks the golden door to freedom.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
30/11/23, 8:26 am - +263 71 532 7755: Good morning
30/11/23, 8:31 am - Sagar: Let us now continue the session.
30/11/23, 8:32 am - Sagar: Please address this, will this help Bradley?
30/11/23, 8:34 am - +263 71 532 7755: Yes l think it will be of great benefit..
30/11/23, 8:36 am - Sagar: I am delighted to hear that Mrs.Mawuka, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
30/11/23, 8:40 am - +263 71 532 7755: Ok understood/ Noted. It's quite Fair
30/11/23, 8:42 am - Sagar: Mrs.Mawuka, by now, I hope you have understood that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is not merely a platform for students to gain admission to an internationally recognized university. It offers much more. Among various differentiators, the value provided by Edoofa to a particular student surpasses that offered by any admission agent or consultant.
30/11/23, 8:47 am - +263 71 532 7755: Yes we are learning.
30/11/23, 8:52 am - Sagar: Alright Mrs.Mawuka, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe you and your family members would be the ones who would be supporting Bradley for his higher education.
30/11/23, 8:53 am - +263 71 532 7755: Yes we will
30/11/23, 8:53 am - +263 71 532 7755: Mr Weale and I
30/11/23, 8:54 am - Sagar: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
30/11/23, 8:56 am - +263 71 532 7755: Ready
30/11/23, 8:58 am - Sagar: Mrs.Mawuka as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
30/11/23, 9:01 am - +263 71 532 7755: From $1 500 to $2 250
30/11/23, 9:02 am - Sagar: Exactly Mrs.Mawuka, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
30/11/23, 9:02 am - Sagar: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 9:03 am - +263 71 532 7755: Ok
30/11/23, 9:03 am - Sagar: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
30/11/23, 9:04 am - +263 71 532 7755: Noted
30/11/23, 9:04 am - +263 71 532 7755: Yes
30/11/23, 9:05 am - Sagar: Also I forgot, you would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

30/11/23, 9:07 am - Sagar: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
30/11/23, 9:09 am - +263 71 532 7755: Year getting the picture now
30/11/23, 9:09 am - +263 71 532 7755: Yes
30/11/23, 9:09 am - Sagar: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
30/11/23, 9:10 am - +258 84 052 7943: Good morning Edoofians, sorry for the late entry
30/11/23, 9:10 am - Sagar: Mrs.Mawuka basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
30/11/23, 9:10 am - Sagar: However Mrs.Mawuka, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
30/11/23, 9:11 am - Sagar: Good Morning Mr.Weale
30/11/23, 9:14 am - +258 84 052 7943: Who is responsible for the flight fees
30/11/23, 9:15 am - +263 71 532 7755: Ok noted
30/11/23, 9:18 am - Sagar: Mr.Weale, the travelling cost to India is a one time cost that has to be beared by you, but you do not have to worry as we will always be there to guide you and help you through every process and our Visa experts will also help you in the VISA application.
30/11/23, 9:18 am - +258 84 052 7943: Noted with thanks
30/11/23, 9:18 am - Sagar: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
30/11/23, 9:19 am - +258 84 052 7943: Please advise
30/11/23, 9:20 am - +263 71 532 7755: Ok
30/11/23, 9:21 am - Sagar: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 9:21 am - Sagar: Alright Mr.Weale, as you can see, we are currently at Step 1. After this step, you will proceed to Step 2. If you successfully pass Step 2, you will receive your Acceptance Letter from the Edoofa Academic Board in Step 3. After that, as shown in the image above, the completion of your Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4.

Upon completing your formalities, in Step 5: we will initiate your Edoofa Admission Process and your Earn While You Learn Program. We will assign your complete application to our Admission Officers and the Head Coach of the Earn While You Learn Program.

The Admission Officers will be responsible for assisting you with all the required admission documentation that we discussed earlier, including the Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendation, and the completion of applications in all of Edoofa’s Associated Universities, etc.

The Head Coach will be responsible for assigning your application to the Earn While You Learn Program Mentor, who will then evaluate your candidature and assist with projects and assignments throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program.
30/11/23, 9:21 am - Sagar: As an organization that has positively impacted the lives of tens of thousands of African students, we understand that over 97% of parents face financial challenges when planning for their child’s tertiary education. In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.

Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa’s Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.

Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:-
*Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.*
*Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*
30/11/23, 9:21 am - +263 71 532 7755: Please brief us.
30/11/23, 9:21 am - Sagar: I hope you now have an in-depth understanding of what happens in Stage 5 of your Edoofa Cycle?
30/11/23, 9:25 am - +263 71 532 7755: Ok l am glade that this process is done in stages.
30/11/23, 9:28 am - Sagar: Yes, that is for your ease, Mrs.Mawuka.
30/11/23, 9:28 am - Sagar: Please address this.
30/11/23, 9:31 am - +258 84 052 7943: I do get it, but please can I take you back to where we began. Is this a 50% or 100 % sponsorship. I mean if admitted
30/11/23, 9:36 am - Sagar: Mr.Weale, after the eligibility check is done, then only I can answer this question, but Edoofa still assures a 50% scholarship.
30/11/23, 9:37 am - +258 84 052 7943: OK thank you
30/11/23, 9:38 am - Sagar: In Step 6: Once the Financial Planning Team assists your parents in budgeting for your higher education, moving forward you will receive offer letters from the universities where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to complete the required registration process,  as well as finalizing the University. *In order to reserve your seat in any particular University chosen by you a registration fee would have to be paid which would be adjusted through your budgeting done in Stage 5 of the Edoofa Cycle.*

*NOTE:- The registration fee adjusted is not an additional cost, rather it is a part of your first year’s annual fee*
30/11/23, 9:38 am - Sagar: *After a few weeks of your registration process, you will be given your Final Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL), which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
30/11/23, 9:38 am - Sagar: So now would you like to ask anything?
30/11/23, 9:41 am - +258 84 052 7943: Yes Mr Gurvinder

So when do we begin?
30/11/23, 9:42 am - Sagar: The process will begin after the eligibility check.
30/11/23, 9:43 am - Sagar: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
30/11/23, 9:43 am - Sagar: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
30/11/23, 9:43 am - Sagar: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

It starts during the  second phase and it helps us parents as it lessens the burden of the first year's annual fee. When the student receives an acceptance letter from the Edoofa Acceptance Board, the completion of their enrollment formalities follows and the student's Edoofa admission process is initiated, that's when the student begins the Earn while you learn program 

7. Yes I am
02/12/23, 11:47 am - Shubham Madhwal: *@258840527943 @263715327755*,  I am happy to see that you understand the program details so well. I totally understand that you have work to do and So I really appreciate your cooperation and the time you are taking out to support your child.

In case you do not follow these terms then *Bradley's* entire scholarship process will go into backlog and you will only be able to apply for the scholarship after 6 months. By then the entire fee structure for the scholarship program may increase*.
02/12/23, 11:48 am - Shubham Madhwal: Ideally, as you know, the tentative dates are:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the *09th or 10th of December 2023* for $200 and the *09th or 10th of January 2024* for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the *09th or 10th of December 2023*

There will be huddles along the way there for family support is very important from the start.
