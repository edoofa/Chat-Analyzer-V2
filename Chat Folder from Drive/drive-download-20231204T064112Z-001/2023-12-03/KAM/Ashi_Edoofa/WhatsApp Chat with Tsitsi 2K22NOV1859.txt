03/08/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you gave the team the go-ahead to proceed with your university admission process, your application was shared with multiple universities which were applicable to your course and were recommended by the Academic Board. Galgotias University and MVN are one of those universities. And acquiring the new offer letter does not mean that your previous offer letter has been revoked. Along with that you are not supposed to proceed with the VISA process before the arrival dates and the Binafide letter has been shared by the institute.
03/08/23, 8:58 pm - +263 77 601 2940: But have you noticed that the offer letter for MVN has dates of commencement of 1st week of august yet its not for visa application so what is exactly taking place

03/08/23, 9:09 pm - +263 77 922 8941: Is it ithat the GGI have not yet sent the dates
03/08/23, 10:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The dates mentioned in the offer letter are the tentative dates, dear. And I would like you to know that the official date of commencement has not been released yet.
03/08/23, 10:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The dates of arrival for your current Institute are being released in batches. So, we have an ample amount of time to proceed with the discussion of the offer letters.
03/08/23, 10:17 pm - +263 77 922 8941: Okay sir so if i choose the other university i have to redo the requirements for visa or they are the same

04/08/23, 8:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, I hope you are well and blessed. Thank you for being patient with us. May I know if you are available to proceed now, dear?
04/08/23, 10:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It seems that we are not able to connect with each other. Hence I would like us to schedule our session for tomorrow at 12:30 PM. Have a great, night.
05/08/23, 7:26 am - +263 77 922 8941: Noted with thanks
05/08/23, 12:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
05/08/23, 12:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
05/08/23, 12:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. 

I hope we are together so far?
05/08/23, 12:56 pm - +263 77 922 8941: Yes
05/08/23, 1:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -

Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle. 

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa. 

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

05/08/23, 1:13 pm - +263 77 922 8941: Yes
05/08/23, 1:15 pm - +263 77 922 8941: Yes we can proceed
05/08/23, 1:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Glad to hear that please. I would be discussing the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have, and to commence our letter discussion,  I would like to confirm the details mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University.
05/08/23, 1:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence, could you please take a moment to review your letter again and provide me with the following information:

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship? 
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is your annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
05/08/23, 1:36 pm - +263 77 922 8941: 1.$350
2.$0
3$1600
4.sports $125
Misc fee $125
Total 250
5.$1000
05/08/23, 1:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the update. As per your offer letter, MVN University has awarded you a 90% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you will only have to pay 10% of the per annum tuition fee for your course at MVN University, i.e. $350.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in your letter, you have also been awarded a 100% waiver on your accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided to you will be free of cost throughout your stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making your education more affordable, isn’t it?
05/08/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 922 8941: Yes it is
05/08/23, 2:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes. Indeed. Now, as you can see in your offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
05/08/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 922 8941: Yes i got it
05/08/23, 2:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you would be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

Now, for the first year, you can see that there are two components that are one-time payable i.e. Sports Fee and Misc. Fee, so your total expenses for the first year become $1600 + $250 = $1850.

Please note that this cost is only for the first year, and from the second year onwards, your per annum cost of education will be $1600. I hope you are clear about that?
05/08/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 922 8941: Yes its very clear
05/08/23, 2:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, now as you are aware of your per annum fee, let me tell you what all facilities are offered by the universities and are covered as per the university's fee structure -

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Exmanitaion Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank 
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.

I hope you are clear with this?
05/08/23, 2:31 pm - +263 77 922 8941: Yes you can explain it
05/08/23, 2:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, students under the Edoofa Program have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
05/08/23, 2:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
05/08/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 922 8941: Yes i am
05/08/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 922 8941: So the 1850 is the total meaning to say the $1000 Admission fee will be subtracted from the total amount
05/08/23, 3:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is absolutely correct
05/08/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 922 8941: Okay i do get it so which one of the 3 GGI MVN and Golgatias is the best
05/08/23, 3:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We will get to that as well
05/08/23, 3:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum education costs of $1600 and so the balance fee becomes $1600 - $1000 = $600 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
05/08/23, 3:44 pm - +263 77 922 8941: Yes i do
07/08/23, 8:37 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Tsitsi. I hope you had a great weekend. I would like you to know that by the time you share the last message our available hours have ended. So please let me know when you are available to further proceed with the session, dear.
07/08/23, 10:50 am - +263 77 601 2940: We are ready now
07/08/23, 10:52 am - +263 77 922 8941: Im ready
07/08/23, 11:01 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear to hear that.
07/08/23, 11:01 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Moving ahead, as informed, the admission and processing fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter will be adjusted against your first year’s expenses of $1850, therefore the amount of fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $1850- $1000 = $850.

I hope you are clear about this as well?
07/08/23, 11:02 am - +263 77 601 2940: Yes its clear
07/08/23, 11:12 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, to secure your scholarship seat with MVN University, a fee of $1000 needs to be paid. However, since you have already paid $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with Gulzar, the total of $750 that you paid for your fee at Gulzar will be adjusted against the registration fee at MVN University and hence you would have to pay the difference in fee which becomes $1000 - $750 = $250.

If you decide to change your university and transfer your admission to MVN University, you will have to make a payment of $250 before 10th of August. I hope this clarifies the information for you?
07/08/23, 11:17 am - +263 77 601 2940: Oky i get it but if i opt to change the University will i be able to come this year
07/08/23, 11:19 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct, all the offer letters that are being shared with you are for the intake of 2023, dear.
07/08/23, 11:35 am - +263 77 601 2940: So am l going to use the requirements l have aready gathered
07/08/23, 11:49 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct. So, shall we continue with the discussion?
07/08/23, 11:50 am - +263 77 601 2940: Yes
07/08/23, 11:50 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad o hear that. Let me share some valuable insights about the university with you:

I also wanted to share an important update with you. I hope you are aware that whenever one makes an International money transfer, there is an amount charged by the bank which is usually around 18%, and this further strains the parents and students in terms of finances.
04/09/23, 2:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To help our students with the most convenient and affordable payment route for their university fees, we have been having a continuous discussion with the accounts team and came up with a solution for the same. Are you aware of the same solution?

Let me help you with this. Based on our discussion with the team, we have found a solution for you. One of our associates in Zimbabwe is scheduled to send some money on the 10th of August, and since the amount is on the higher end of the scale. Students can utilize this opportunity to make their fee payment through the same associate with just a 11% International Transfer charge.
04/09/23, 2:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This means that you won't have to incur any additional International Transfer charges, making it the most convenient and cost-effective mode for you to pay your fee.
04/09/23, 2:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please note that local charges are to be borne by the student, but with this option, you can significantly reduce the overall cost of the fee payment. We are here to support you throughout the process, so if you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out.
04/09/23, 2:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me also assist you with the account details for the payment of your fee at a minimal charge and introduce you to the associate, Mr. Rajan. He has been helping students transfer their fees to India for a long time.
04/09/23, 2:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you make the payment of your fee, Mr. Rajan will issue a payment receipt to you, which will serve as proof of payment. Kindly share this receipt with us here in your admission group, so that we can notify the university officials accordingly. This will help ensure a smooth process for your admission.

The payment can be made either in cash or through Mukuru. Please note that in both cases, there will be a transfer charge of 11% of the amount you wish to send.

If you are located in Harare and prefer to make the payment in cash, you can arrange to meet him at Avonlea, 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare.
04/09/23, 2:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are familiar with Mukuru, you can choose to make the payment through that platform. I will provide you with his contact details so that you can directly connect with him and coordinate the payment yourself.

As you prepare for your departure and get ready to board your flight from your home country, please take a moment to review the following messages. They contain important instructions for things you need to do before boarding your flight and tasks you'll need to complete upon your arrival in India.

*As per our records, your flight is scheduled to land in India on the 8th of Sep at 08:10 am at the Delhi Airport.*

Please read these instructions carefully and follow each one diligently. They are not only essential for your safety but also crucial to ensuring a smooth journey to India. We have full confidence that you understand the importance of these arrival instructions and will adhere to them accordingly.
06/09/23, 2:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Things to do before departure:*

1. Kindly ensure that all of your luggage is properly labeled with your name and securely locked to guarantee safety during travel.

2. Make sure you get a covid test done and have a negative RT/PCR report with you.

3. Keep at least $150 cash handy with you. The easiest, most reliable way to convert your dollars into Indian rupees and to get the best exchange rate is to do so at the airport. Additionally, make sure to double-check the conversion rate online before exchanging the money.

4. Keep your passport and Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) handy for identification.

5. Before boarding your flight, take a picture of yourself at the airport and share it in your respective admissions group. This will help the team identify you upon your arrival at the airport.

06/09/23, 2:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Post Arrival Instructions*

1. As soon as your flight lands, kindly connect to the wifi. You would need at least one to one and a half hours to check out and collect your baggage. Inside the airport, you will have to buy an Indian sim card which would cost you around $5-$7. Activate the SIM and call the officials whose contact details you have.

2. After you check out from the airport, do not leave the premises or take a taxi from the airport to the university. Taxi drivers may approach you, but ignore them and give a call to Mr. Rithvik at the number: +91 7696398732

3. Make sure to keep $50 additional with you for the bus fare. The Edoofa officials will assist you in boarding the bus. Remember to adjust your watch to be 03 hours 30 Minutes ahead of your time, as that will be the local time in India.
06/09/23, 2:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please take your time to carefully review the above instructions, including the provided pictures of the designated waiting area at the airport. Additionally, make sure to go through the shared Travel Guidelines. Once you have read and understood everything, kindly send an acknowledgment here in the group.
