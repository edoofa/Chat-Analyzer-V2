08/09/23, 9:13 am - +263 73 336 1474: Good morning and thank you for highlighting the requirements but I think there might be a problem on number 8 which deals with the bank balance because here in Zimbabwe there's a mistrust between banks and clients as such people no longer take their money to banks but as a parent I promise to pay as required

19/09/23, 8:32 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Angeline!
I hope this message finds you in good health.

I am Mr. Milan, the Senior Admissions Officer at Edoofa. Currently, I am diligently reviewing the application files of students who are preparing to join us for the 2023 intake in India. During this process, I noticed that you have plans to commence your studies at PDM University.
19/09/23, 8:32 am - Milan Edoofa: As we eagerly await the arrival date confirmation from PDM University, I wanted to mention that we recently engaged in a conversation to finalize the details, and the university has indicated that they will be providing us with an update within this week.

Given the time at hand, I would like to seize this opportunity to discuss a potential option with you that could potentially enhance both the affordability and enrichment of your higher education experience in India. Would now be a suitable time for us to engage in this discussion or otherwise, you can let me know by when can we have this discussion?
19/09/23, 8:54 am - +263 78 050 2330: I am okay and you sir
19/09/23, 8:54 am - +263 78 050 2330: We can start the discussion now I'm free
19/09/23, 9:05 am - Milan Edoofa: I'm delighted to learn that you are open to discussing this matter. Before we get into the specifics, I wanted to share a recent development that could significantly influence your educational journey.

Edoofa has recently established a partnership with a new university here in India. This collaboration has prompted the academic board to revisit scholarship opportunities for a select group of students, including yourself, with the intention of providing a more enhanced educational pathway.

Under this new collaboration, the university is offering more substantial scholarship opportunities for the course related to your field of study, particularly in the field of Commerce.
19/09/23, 9:05 am - Milan Edoofa: Through this unique opportunity, you are in a position to secure a remarkable 90% scholarship on your tuition fee, along with a 100% sponsorship for your accommodation expenses. What's particularly striking is the potential to significantly alleviate the financial burdens tied to education. This could effectively bring down your annual expenses to just $1600, encompassing all essential aspects of your education and residence.

I am eager to hear your initial thoughts on this matter. Would you be interested in exploring this specialized course further and getting into the finer details of how this opportunity could potentially transform your educational journey?
19/09/23, 9:09 am - +263 78 050 2330: I'm sorry but I don't think I'll be able to change the university now because we've all come  to an agreement as a family and chose PDM university
19/09/23, 9:11 am - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I would appreciate it if you could share the thought process that led you to choose PDM University over MVN University, especially given the attractive 90% scholarship offered by MVN. This will help me understand your thought process better and then provide you with valuable feedback that can ensure you start your career right.
19/09/23, 9:14 am - +263 78 050 2330: I understand the offer by MVN university and I also calculated the expenses but I already chose PDM university as I feel it's the best university for me to study my career. Also my family is willing to pay the fees at PDM university
19/09/23, 2:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, that is why I am willing to know about why is that you preferred PDM over MVN and what were your reasons?
19/09/23, 3:41 pm - +263 78 050 2330: We calculated all the costs and we preferred PDM university as it is cheaper
19/09/23, 4:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, I would surely like to know about how does PDM seemed cheaper to you than MVN please?
19/09/23, 4:18 pm - +263 78 050 2330: We calculated the fees per year
19/09/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please can you also help me in understanding about your calculation as well?
19/09/23, 4:30 pm - +263 78 050 2330: I'll do so
19/09/23, 4:30 pm - +263 78 050 2330: Plus my family members did not want to change school since I was given PDM university at first
19/09/23, 4:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I truly value your perspective, and it's clear that PDM University holds its merits as a preferred choice. I want to assure you that your choice of PDM is entirely valid and commendable.

However, I would also like to present an alternative viewpoint. Through recent conversations with the academic board and interactions with students, MVN University has surfaced as a university with exceptional potential. Its reputation for academic excellence, combined with its commitment to holistic student development, has garnered substantial recognition.
19/09/23, 4:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: For a moment, I want you to Imagine an environment where modern infrastructure, well-equipped classrooms, state-of-the-art labs, extensive libraries, comfortable hostels, and ample sports facilities converge to create an optimal learning atmosphere. MVN University takes pride in fostering an all-encompassing educational journey and hence it seems to be a better fit for you and your family.

What sets MVN apart is its unwavering dedication to innovation and nurturing students' holistic growth. This focus positions MVN as a formidable contender against any institution. While PDM University undoubtedly has its merits, MVN's comprehensive approach offers a unique blend of academic prowess and personal development.
19/09/23, 4:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moreover, let's consider the financial aspect. Opting for MVN University would substantially lower your educational expenses. To put things in perspective, the annual costs at MVN are nearly half of what you would incur at PDM. This equates to obtaining a superior education, coupled with valuable cost savings, which could significantly impact your long-term financial outlook. I hope you are following?
19/09/23, 4:34 pm - +263 78 050 2330: Yes I am following sir
19/09/23, 4:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: In essence, PDM is undoubtedly a strong choice, and MVN's merits simply provide an additional dimension to consider. We understand that every student's journey is unique, and our intention is to present you with a holistic perspective so you can make an informed decision that resonates with your aspirations.

Hence, the academic board has asked you to reconsider your university choice and give it a through thought before you commence your visa application process.
19/09/23, 4:35 pm - +263 78 050 2330: Okay noted sir
19/09/23, 4:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. On that note, can you please let me know how do you wish to move ahead with Angeline's admission process?
19/09/23, 4:40 pm - +263 78 050 2330: I just wanted to finish the procceses left for now
19/09/23, 4:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, however, I am asking about the opportunity that you have here for Angeline, i,e. to shift her to MVN get a better scholarship opportunity, and better quality education?
19/09/23, 4:41 pm - +263 78 050 2330: I don't think I can do so sir
19/09/23, 7:59 pm - +263 73 336 1474: Good evening Sir can you please highlight me on the comparable costs of the 2 universities and the programs offered considering that my daughter wishes to study for a Bsc in Economics
20/09/23, 3:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Angeline!
I hope you are doing well today.
20/09/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 050 2330: I am okay and you sir
20/09/23, 3:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. When it comes to pursuing the course at PDM University, it would be around $2500-2800 per annum please. Moving ahead, when it comes to pursuing the B.Com, course, which is a better alternative to the the BA Economics course and the academic board highly suggests Angeline to pursue that course since it would help her in navigating her career in a much better way, the costs for the same would be $1200-1500 per annum please. I hope this is clear?
20/09/23, 3:08 pm - +263 78 050 2330: Yes it is clear
21/09/23, 10:10 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Angeline!
I hope you are doing well today.
21/09/23, 10:10 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that it is clear to you. Now, on that, note, shall we move ahead to finalize Angeline's admission at MVN University please?
21/09/23, 10:42 am - +263 78 050 2330: I am okay and you sir
21/09/23, 10:42 am - +263 78 050 2330: No please we've finalized that I go to PDM
21/09/23, 1:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: May I know why is that you still wish to go to PDM Angeline?
21/09/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 050 2330: I've already stated that more than once sir and I've already finalized that I'll go to PDM
21/09/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 050 2330: Sir you gave me an option to choose the university I would like to go and I chose PDM. I don't know why you're giving me the option to choose again when I've already done that
23/09/23, 2:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Angeline!
I hope you are doing well today.
23/09/23, 2:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: @263780502330 When it comes to the fact that you have finalized about going to PDM, I completely understand that, however, it is my responsibility to make sure that you have all the choices available to you so that you can make a well-informed decision to continue with your higher education. In that situation, if you are certain that you wish to go to PDM, then we can confirm that as well. 

On that note, shall we finalize about the same and inform the university officials about that?
23/09/23, 2:45 pm - +263 73 336 1474: Yes Sir I think it's ok
25/09/23, 5:34 pm - +263 78 050 2330: Good afternoon sir are there any new developments concerning my coming there
26/09/23, 9:46 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Angeline!

26/09/23, 10:00 am - +263 78 050 2330: I am okay and you sir

28/09/23, 9:59 am - +263 78 050 2330: I wanted to know the payment plan and per annum fees and also the accommodation fees per annum
28/09/23, 9:59 am - +263 78 050 2330: I am okay and you sir
28/09/23, 10:02 am - +263 78 050 2330: I also wanted to ask if students have already started learning
28/09/23, 1:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Regarding that, I believe Mr. Shivjeet had already discussed the offer letter from MVN University with you earlier, may I know if you would like to discuss that again so to have clarity on the costs as well as the other things?
28/09/23, 1:37 pm - +263 78 050 2330: Yes let's discuss it again for more clarity
28/09/23, 2:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, I am sharing the letter with you here. Please go through it and then let me know once you are done.
28/09/23, 2:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/09/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 050 2330: I am done sir
28/09/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 050 2330: If possible can you also share the one from PDM
28/09/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 050 2330: I've calculated and found out that I'll pay $2500per annum and also $1250 once
28/09/23, 3:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Your calculation seems to be wrong to me dear. For clarity on that, please take a moment to review your letter again and provide me with the following information:

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is your annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
28/09/23, 3:41 pm - +263 78 050 2330: 1. 0
2. 0
3. $1250
4. $250
5. $1000
28/09/23, 3:41 pm - +263 78 050 2330: Hello
28/09/23, 3:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per your offer letter, MVN University has awarded you a 100% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout your course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in your letter, you have also been awarded a 100% waiver on your accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided to you will be free of cost throughout your stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making your education more affordable, isn’t it?
28/09/23, 3:46 pm - +263 78 050 2330: Can you share the one  for PDM again soo that we can compare
28/09/23, 3:48 pm - +263 78 050 2330: Plus what about the other expenses mentioned in the offer letter such as ; admin fee, exam fee, international student development fund and EDP and Book Bank that are stated to be paid yearly
28/09/23, 3:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, I will do that once we complete the discussion about the offer letter from MVN please.
28/09/23, 3:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as you can see in your offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $0
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
28/09/23, 3:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you would be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1250.

Now, for the first year, you can see that there are two components that are one-time payable i.e. Sports Fee and Misc. Fee, so your total expenses for the first year become $1250 + $250 = $1500.

Please note that this cost is only for the first year, and from the second year onwards, your per annum cost of education will be $1250. I hope you are clear about that?
28/09/23, 3:55 pm - +263 78 050 2330: Yes I can understand
28/09/23, 3:56 pm - +263 78 050 2330: You haven't answered me on this one
28/09/23, 3:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Angeline we are coming to discuss that dear, please be a bit patient. Now that you are aware of your per annum fee, let me tell you what all facilities are offered by the universities and are covered as per the university's fee structure - 

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Exmanitaion Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.

I hope you are clear with this?
28/09/23, 3:56 pm - +263 78 050 2330: Okay I will be waiting
28/09/23, 4:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, may I know if you are clear till here as well please?
28/09/23, 4:04 pm - +263 78 050 2330: Yes it's clear sir
28/09/23, 4:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, students under the Edoofa Program have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
28/09/23, 4:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
28/09/23, 4:06 pm - +263 78 050 2330: Yes sir
28/09/23, 4:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, moving ahead, as you can see the admission fee for MVN University is $1000, and since you have already paid $750 for your registration at PDM University, this leaves you with a balance of $250 to be paid in order to shift and confirm your admission at MVN. 

I hope this is clear?
28/09/23, 4:11 pm - +263 78 050 2330: Yes it is sir
28/09/23, 4:13 pm - +263 78 050 2330: Since you said I'll be paying $1250 per year after my second year I hope there won't be any unnecessary changes in my fees
28/09/23, 4:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Coming to the payment of the registration fee, I believe you made the payment of it through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank, would you be able to pay the remaining $250 through that as well?
28/09/23, 4:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, there won't be any other charges except the ones mentioned in the offer letter please.
28/09/23, 4:15 pm - +263 78 050 2330: Which ones sir be clear on this so that we can know the amount we will pay
28/09/23, 4:15 pm - +263 78 050 2330: When sir
28/09/23, 4:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Angeline, earlier when you made the payment of your registration fee for PDM, you had done it through Mr. Shorwi's bank account, right?
28/09/23, 4:19 pm - +263 78 050 2330: Yes I did
28/09/23, 4:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, now, would you be able to make the payment of the balance $250 with that too? So that I can share the details of the same with you here?
28/09/23, 4:21 pm - +263 78 050 2330: Hello
28/09/23, 4:21 pm - +263 78 050 2330: Asi per now sir I don't know but what's the due date
28/09/23, 4:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Angeline, I did not get you here dear, can you please come again what is it exactly that you wish to say?
28/09/23, 4:22 pm - +263 78 050 2330: I wanted to know the due date for the payment of the remaining $250
28/09/23, 4:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Regarding that, you would have to make the payment as soon as possible, hence, can you please let me know by when would you be able to do that?
28/09/23, 4:24 pm - +263 78 050 2330: I don't know I'll get back to you when I discuss with my family
28/09/23, 4:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, you can do that. May I know by when can I expect your response on that dear?
28/09/23, 4:27 pm - +263 78 050 2330: I can't give a certain date sir
28/09/23, 4:27 pm - +263 78 050 2330: And how will I pay the fees
28/09/23, 4:27 pm - +263 78 050 2330: Like do you have payment plans like the ones I was offered by PDM
28/09/23, 4:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, in order to discuss that itself, you would first have to give me information on by when would you be able to pay the balance?
28/09/23, 4:31 pm - +263 78 050 2330: Okay but as per now we don't have it because we had planned that I pay fees for PDM when I arrive so we don't have the money sir. Your changes are affecting us that's why we didn't want any changes because we knew that every school comes with it's own expenses. With all due respect sir if it's possible just let me go to PDM university because right now the conditions have changed
28/09/23, 4:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, on that note, how much had you planned to pay for PDM's fee when you would have arrived here in India?
28/09/23, 4:36 pm - +263 78 050 2330: The part fees $813 but it's not promised that I'll pay on arrival
28/09/23, 4:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, how much out of that $813 were you certain about that you would pay on your arrival please?
28/09/23, 4:37 pm - +263 78 050 2330: We are not certain to pay any amount that's why I'm not promising a date to pay the remaining balance
28/09/23, 4:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, please have a discussion with your parents about that and then let me know about by when would you be able to do that?
28/09/23, 4:38 pm - +263 78 050 2330: On another note sir when are schools opening
28/09/23, 4:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: The university is already open dear, but the classes have not started as of now.
28/09/23, 4:41 pm - +263 78 050 2330: Okay sir but this is not what we had planned it might not work out well that's why we didn't want to change schools
28/09/23, 4:41 pm - +263 78 050 2330: So will I be able to catch up with them when you're changing me to another school we didn't agree at the first place
28/09/23, 4:42 pm - +263 78 050 2330: With all due respect sir can you please let me go to PDM because you're now confusing us
28/09/23, 4:52 pm - +263 73 336 1474: Well good afternoon I am Angeline's parent just wanted to know if the 1000 registration fee is also part of the fees for the first year
28/09/23, 4:52 pm - +263 77 457 5725: Hello sir I'm Angeline's mother. I'm now worried the year is about to come to an end while the student is still here yet in the first place you said she will come there at the end of August but now we are approaching October
28/09/23, 5:38 pm - +263 78 050 2330: Hello sir we are going to pay the  remaining $250 tomorrow
29/09/23, 10:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Angeline!
I hope you are doing well today.
29/09/23, 10:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your queries with me here please. Now, let me answer them here one by one. 

First of all when it comes to the starting of the intake in the end of August, it is a tentative timeline that all the universities follow here in India, however, the actual timeline depends on the individual universities on the basis of their processes and how they like their academic year to start. That is why MVN University is set to start their classes in the coming month itself. Whereas PDM is still yet to give their official date of arrival, this means that they may start their classes even later than MVN.
 
Moving ahead, when it comes to catching up with the other students at MVN, there wouldn't be any need for the same since the classes haven't started yet and the students are still in their orientation period.
29/09/23, 10:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Coming to the second query, i.e. the admission fee of $1000 being adjusted in the first year fee, yes please, that is true. Once paid, the total admission fee of $1000 will be adjusted in Angeline's first year fee, which means you would only have to pay the balance later on.
29/09/23, 10:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, I believe you must be clear with the queries that you had. Moving ahead, as you mentioned that you are going to make the payment of $250 today, please proceed to do that and once done, please share the receipt of the same with me here.
29/09/23, 10:17 am - +263 78 050 2330: Morning sir we will share the receipt with you very soon
29/09/23, 10:18 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please dear.
29/09/23, 10:18 am - +263 78 050 2330: Okay sir I guess then we will move on to the next step
29/09/23, 10:19 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear.
29/09/23, 10:19 am - +263 78 050 2330: Okay so if I'm done when can j come to school
29/09/23, 10:20 am - Milan Edoofa: Once you would be done with the payment,  we will start with your VISA Process right away today itself, and then before Mid October, you would be here in India.
29/09/23, 10:20 am - +263 78 050 2330: Okay sir thank you
29/09/23, 3:35 pm - +263 73 336 1474: <Media omitted>
29/09/23, 3:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the payment receipt for your university registration fee. It has been duly noted with us and we have shared it with the accounts team as well for payment confirmation. 

Once the payment is confirmed by the accounts team and the amount has been reflected in India, we will notify you and the university officials accordingly.

06/10/23, 10:18 am - +263 78 050 2330: I am okay and you sir

06/10/23, 4:08 pm - +263 78 050 2330: It has been my dream to become an Economist sir
06/10/23, 4:46 pm - +263 73 336 1474: I think this stage of knowing why she wishes was done at the beginning and as such asking about it now just bogles the mind because currently we as parents are just concentrating on how we are going to deal with the movements from here to India

07/10/23, 1:26 pm - +263 78 050 2330: Okay sir
07/10/23, 1:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, when you say it was your dream to be an Economist, in that case, did you ever consider choosing an alternative course that could help you better in achieving your career goals?
07/10/23, 1:27 pm - +263 78 050 2330: No sir
07/10/23, 1:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that, Angeline. I understand your passion for economics. However, I'd like to discuss an alternative course with you that could potentially align even better with your career aspirations and provide you with a more comprehensive education. Have you heard about the Bachelor of Commerce (B.Com) program?
07/10/23, 1:31 pm - +263 78 050 2330: Not really sir
07/10/23, 1:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright Angeline, I understand that. Now, oftentimes, a lack of proper knowledge can lead you to not making a well-informed decision. However, that is exactly the reason that we are here to help you with. Moving ahead, firstly,  I'd like to highlight some advantages of the B.Com program that might make it a suitable choice for you. The B.Com program offers a broader understanding of the business world, including economics, finance, accounting, marketing, and management.

By choosing B.Com, you can study economics as a core subject while also gaining knowledge in various other business disciplines. This well-rounded education can make you more versatile and open doors to a wider range of career opportunities in the future. I hope you are following?
07/10/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 050 2330: Yes I am
07/10/23, 1:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Now, let me delve deeper into why B.Com could be a beneficial choice for you. The Bachelor of Commerce program equips you with a versatile skill set, which includes not only economics but also financial management, accounting principles, marketing strategies, and business management.

This diverse knowledge base can be incredibly advantageous because it prepares you to adapt to a rapidly changing business landscape. You'll be able to understand how different aspects of a business work together, which is a valuable skill in today's interconnected world.
07/10/23, 1:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Additionally, B.Com graduates are often sought after in various industries, not just limited to economics-related roles. Your career options will be broader, and you'll have the flexibility to explore different career paths. I hope you understand?
07/10/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 050 2330: Yes I do
07/10/23, 1:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm glad you see the potential benefits, Angeline. It's essential to recognize that while pursuing economics is your dream, having a well-rounded education in business through the B.Com program can significantly enhance your skills and employability. Let me share another perspective with you.

Imagine yourself working in a dynamic organization where you're not only analyzing economic trends but also understanding the financial health of the company, making marketing strategies, and managing the day-to-day operations. This broader skill set can make you a valuable asset in any business environment.
07/10/23, 1:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: Furthermore, many successful economists have a strong foundation in business and finance. By pursuing a B.Com program first, you can later specialize in economics at the postgraduate level, combining the best of both worlds. It provides you with flexibility and opens doors to diverse career opportunities. I hope you are clear till here as well, right?
07/10/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 050 2330: I understand sir
07/10/23, 1:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, what are your thoughts on this opportunity that we have discussed here Angeline?
07/10/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 050 2330: I can't change the program I want to study sir because it has been my dream to study BA Economics and its a dream come true
07/10/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 050 2330: But if you're insisting I study it or if the college doesn't offer BA Economics then I'll take it
08/10/23, 8:44 am - +263 78 050 2330: Good morning sir
It has come to my knowledge that other students at MVN have already started learning and exams might be written this month yet I'm still at home. Can't you see that I'm now being disadvantaged here and it might be difficult for me to catch up with others
09/10/23, 7:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Angeline!
I hope you are doing well today.
09/10/23, 7:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, I understand that you wanted to do BA Economics, but since I have been working here in the education industry for as long as your age is, I would highly recommend that you choose B.Com course for your higher education, since it would provide you with much better knowledge in the field of economics and will give you a much greater career path. I hope this is clear?
09/10/23, 7:47 pm - +263 78 050 2330: I am okay and you sir
09/10/23, 7:47 pm - +263 78 050 2330: Yes it is then you can change the program for me because I now want to come study with others
09/10/23, 7:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know dear. Now, for that to happen, please write a mail to "*academicboard@edoofa.com*" stating that you had a discussion with your admission officer Mr. Milan about the change of course and that you have decided to pursue the B.Com course for your higher education here in India. Once you are done writing the mail, please let me know.
09/10/23, 7:51 pm - +263 78 050 2330: Okay I'll do so sir
09/10/23, 7:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Once you are done writing the mail, please let me know.

16/10/23, 8:04 am - +263 78 050 2330: But I have them in my phone can I photocopy them from my phone
16/10/23, 8:05 am - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, the itinerary ticket is the dummy ticket which needs to be booked for your Visa, it shows that you are traveling to the particular date but without actually buying the ticket.

16/10/23, 1:03 pm - +263 78 050 2330: How will I be able to get money from my parents when I come there
16/10/23, 1:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263780502330. When it comes to accessing funds from your parents while you're in India, you have a couple of options. Firstly, you can opt for the traditional method of bringing the money in cash with you. However, for a more secure and convenient approach, I'd suggest considering opening a bank account in India. This way, your parents can easily transfer the funds directly into your Indian bank account, making it a safer and more practical way to manage your finances during your stay.
16/10/23, 1:19 pm - +263 78 050 2330: How do I open the bank account
16/10/23, 1:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly don't worry @263780502330, We'll guide you in opening the account once you will arrive in India.
16/10/23, 1:22 pm - +263 78 050 2330: Okay ma'am noted

22/11/23, 12:15 pm - +91 93546 23922: Dear Parents,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention a matter of utmost importance regarding your child's academic standing at the college.

Despite several reminders and extensive conversations, it has come to our attention that the outstanding fees  *$500* your child's education have not been settled. We have made diligent efforts to work with you, engaging in negotiations with the university on your behalf. Regrettably, these efforts have not yielded a resolution, and the outstanding payment remains unresolved.

As a result of the persistent non-payment, the college has taken the difficult decision to block your child's access to classes. This means that, effective immediately, your child will be unable to attend any classes until the outstanding fees are settled.

We understand that financial matters can be challenging, and we have been committed to finding an amicable solution. However, the prolonged non-payment has left us with no alternative but to take this measure.

We urge you to address this matter urgently to ensure your child's uninterrupted academic progress. 

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter. We believe that together we can resolve this issue and continue to support your child's educational journey.
