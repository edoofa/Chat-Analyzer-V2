14/10/23, 11:35 am - +263 77 244 4889: Ok how are you sir

14/10/23, 11:37 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know why you wish to change the course?
14/10/23, 11:43 am - +263 77 244 4889: I don't wish to change but just asking for a possibility
14/10/23, 11:45 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, it is indeed given that you are eligible for the said course. May I know if you are clear here?
14/10/23, 11:55 am - +263 77 244 4889: Yes

16/10/23, 4:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>

16/10/23, 10:34 pm - +263 77 669 4287: How are u sir 
I hope l find u well too

 Thank you sir
17/10/23, 3:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you are doing well and blessed. I am happy to let you know that I am now available to take our session. I would like to know if you are currently active and ready to proceed with the session?
17/10/23, 3:23 pm - +263 77 669 4287: Hello sir how are u
17/10/23, 3:23 pm - +263 77 669 4287: Sure am active
17/10/23, 3:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
17/10/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 669 4287: There was the mentioning of payment of the university administration to be paid
17/10/23, 3:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
17/10/23, 3:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
17/10/23, 5:30 pm - +263 77 244 4889: Yes I'm getting you
17/10/23, 5:31 pm - +263 77 244 4889: Very thoughtful of you cz with the economic hardships we are facing here it will be of great help
17/10/23, 5:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
17/10/23, 5:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
17/10/23, 6:05 pm - +263 77 244 4889: Yes understood
17/10/23, 6:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
17/10/23, 6:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
17/10/23, 6:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
17/10/23, 6:27 pm - +263 77 244 4889: Very clear
17/10/23, 6:32 pm - +263 77 669 4287: We may proceed sir
17/10/23, 7:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
17/10/23, 7:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
17/10/23, 7:46 pm - +263 77 669 4287: Sure
17/10/23, 7:46 pm - +263 77 669 4287: I am aware
17/10/23, 7:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
17/10/23, 7:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
17/10/23, 7:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
17/10/23, 7:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
17/10/23, 7:57 pm - +263 77 669 4287: It is clear in did
17/10/23, 8:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
17/10/23, 8:05 pm - +263 77 669 4287: I assure you we We will not be considering any of the above because am going to perform well <This message was edited>
17/10/23, 8:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
17/10/23, 8:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
17/10/23, 8:10 pm - +263 77 669 4287: It is indeed clear
17/10/23, 8:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
17/10/23, 8:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
17/10/23, 8:14 pm - +263 77 669 4287: Clear
17/10/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
17/10/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
17/10/23, 8:23 pm - +263 77 669 4287: Understand sir
17/10/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
17/10/23, 8:41 pm - +263 77 669 4287: Am surely looking forward to receiving my letter sir
17/10/23, 8:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for your application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
17/10/23, 8:46 pm - +263 77 669 4287: Okay okay thank you sir
23/10/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 669 4287: Hello sir

15/11/23, 6:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I appreciate you taking the time to go through the offer letter. Let me clarify the details regarding the endowment plan and address your concerns. As of now, your application has been accepted by the PDM University and since we have shared his application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from others. 

Once we get the same update, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application. So, you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. I would also like to add that in the event you want to wait for the next offer letter, you will be required to pay for the current offer letter in order to retain this offer if you want to back off from the next offer letter.
15/11/23, 6:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Regarding the registration fee that you are required to pay, it can be adjusted to the university of your choice, and you have the privilege to do that as you are an Edoofian. It is one of the benefits that we provide to our students in terms of affordability and choices. I will dive into more as we proceed with the session. May I know if you are clear here for now? <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 6:57 pm - +263 77 244 4889: Yes

If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/11/23, 7:09 pm - +263 77 244 4889: Ok go on
15/11/23, 7:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from PDM University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 7:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/11/23, 7:17 pm - +263 77 244 4889: Tuition fees 2415 per year
15/11/23, 7:18 pm - +263 77 244 4889: Duration 3years
15/11/23, 7:18 pm - +263 77 244 4889: This message was deleted
15/11/23, 7:20 pm - +263 77 244 4889: Just saw registration fees of 750 of which after endowment not sure we're paying how much
15/11/23, 7:20 pm - +263 77 244 4889: I'm not sure about procedure fee
15/11/23, 7:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would like to let you know that I will be closing our session for now due to unexpected work that just came up.

So please do excuse me for that and, let us connect tomorrow from 12:30 PM onwards. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
15/11/23, 7:58 pm - +263 77 244 4889: Same here
16/11/23, 1:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Tinotenda !

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. I am now active and prepared to start our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
16/11/23, 1:04 pm - +263 77 244 4889: We can start
16/11/23, 1:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if the answer here to question 1 is correct?
16/11/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 244 4889: I stand to be corrected
16/11/23, 2:04 pm - +263 77 244 4889: But it's correct
16/11/23, 2:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 244 4889: Yes
16/11/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 244 4889: I noted that
16/11/23, 2:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me provide some additional details regarding your offer letter from PDM University. Following the scholarship, your annual tuition fee amounts to $1165, and your annual accommodation fee amounts to $1250. This results in the per annum cost of education being $2415. I hope this provides you with a clear understanding of the financial aspects of your education?
16/11/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 244 4889: Yes
16/11/23, 2:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Glad to see you following through. Regarding accommodation at PDM University, it is recommended that for the first year, students opt for on-campus hostels since they are new to the area and the university can better assist them with their Foreigner Regional Registration Office (FRRO) requirements.
16/11/23, 2:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: From the second year onward, when they are more familiar with the place and have made friends, if they wish, they have the option to move out of on-campus accommodation and explore the off-campus options.
16/11/23, 2:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you plan to stay outside the campus, her accommodation fee would be reduced to $1000 per annum, paid directly to the landlord. The average monthly rent would be $50 to $70, and the cost of food would be $20 to $30.
16/11/23, 2:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the off-campus accommodation, hence the reduced per annum cost would be $2165 ($1165 tuition fee + $1000 off-campus accommodation). I trust this provides you with clarity on the accommodation options?
16/11/23, 2:59 pm - +263 77 244 4889: Clarified
16/11/23, 3:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In light of this, let us move forward with our discussion. As you are now familiar with your annual fee at PDM University, let me outline the various facilities and services covered by the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Food Cost
4. Library Fee
5. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
6. Gymnasium Fee
7. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
16/11/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 244 4889: Noted
16/11/23, 3:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we have established Name’s total annual education cost as $2165, let me also guide you on how we can make her education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
16/11/23, 3:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
16/11/23, 3:12 pm - +263 77 244 4889: Noted
16/11/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 244 4889: Wanted to ask  is the fees a once off payment or we can do that in installments
16/11/23, 3:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For the tuition fees, you will be required to pay them on a semester basis, meaning twice a year. I will be able to share further details as we proceed with the session. So, shall we proceed with the session?
16/11/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 244 4889: Yes
16/11/23, 3:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Glad to see you together with the discussion. With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that Tinotenda with her hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
16/11/23, 3:31 pm - +263 77 244 4889: That will be great and less burden for me
16/11/23, 3:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, she can use this $1000 to cover a portion of her annual fee, which is $2165. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2165 - $1000 = $1165, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
16/11/23, 3:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how Yemurai can effectively make her education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
16/11/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 244 4889: Yes
16/11/23, 3:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted

16/11/23, 3:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
16/11/23, 3:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright, With this, let us now shift our attention to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter. As previously explained, the registration fee of $750 is not an extra cost, it is included in her first-year educational expenses. Therefore, the amount of the fee you will need to pay once she arrives in India will be as follows:
16/11/23, 3:47 pm - +263 77 244 4889: Wanted to ask won't this interfere with their university education
16/11/23, 3:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. If you go with the *Off-campus accommodation*, this means you only need to pay the tuition fee to the university. Therefore, the fee balance becomes $1165 - $750 = $415, and this must be paid in one part within three days of your arrival in India.
16/11/23, 3:48 pm - +263 77 244 4889: Would prefer in campus since she doesn't have anyone there
16/11/23, 3:48 pm - +263 77 244 4889: Or there is allocated time
16/11/23, 3:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is a great question, and I would like to let you know that the EWYL sessions are designed not to interfere with the classes, and they would be conducted at times when she is not occupied with her classes. I hope this is clear to you?
16/11/23, 3:50 pm - +263 77 244 4889: Clear
16/11/23, 3:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Indeed, you can opt for off-campus housing. However, she would not be alone there as there are other students ready to join the intake at the same time as Tinotenda.

2. Consequently, If you opt for *On-campus accommodation*, the tuition fee of $1165  and the accommodation fee of $1250 will be required. This totals $2415. After deducting the registration fee, the remaining balance will be $2415 - $750 = $1165. This amount can be paid in two installments of $832 and $833 , spaced 6 months apart.
16/11/23, 3:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The first installment can be paid either before arrival in India or within three days of arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.

I hope this clarifies the fee structure, and are we aligned on these options?
16/11/23, 4:07 pm - +263 77 244 4889: Driving home from work now we can continue when l get home 30  minutes time
16/11/23, 4:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, please let me know when you are available to proceed with the session.
16/11/23, 4:42 pm - +263 77 244 4889: Let's proceed
16/11/23, 4:44 pm - +263 77 244 4889: Clarified
16/11/23, 4:45 pm - +263 77 244 4889: Yes  I  think in campus for 1st year is good
16/11/23, 4:48 pm - +263 77 244 4889: Do  you approve these  these off campus housing l mean do you know the landlords or they find themselves
16/11/23, 5:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing a great question the off campus housing are approved by us and by the time of arrival our Edoofian officials will be there there to allocate you Tinotenda with the accomodation of her choice along with her local friends as they will be staying near to each other. I hope you are clear on this ?
16/11/23, 5:16 pm - +263 77 244 4889: Clear
16/11/23, 5:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that, and you're free to go with the second option as per your preference. As outlined in the offer letter, it's required for a student to submit a registration fee of $750 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the deadline date as November 28th, 2023.
16/11/23, 5:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In connection to our prior conversation and the benefits extended through the Endowment plan, you may remember the entitlement to a $150 grant applicable toward the registration fee. Also, there's a flexible payment plan available to ease the fee payment. Would you want me to explain its workings?
16/11/23, 5:20 pm - +263 77 244 4889: Yes please
16/11/23, 5:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
16/11/23, 5:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
16/11/23, 5:27 pm - +263 77 244 4889: Very clear
16/11/23, 5:27 pm - +263 77 244 4889: Will do the 2 installments
16/11/23, 5:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, please. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
16/11/23, 5:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
16/11/23, 5:31 pm - +263 77 244 4889: Harare
16/11/23, 5:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
16/11/23, 5:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
16/11/23, 5:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
16/11/23, 5:32 pm - +263 77 244 4889: But last time l used my stanbic bank to make the payment straight to lndizn back
16/11/23, 5:32 pm - +263 77 244 4889: Noted
16/11/23, 5:33 pm - +263 77 244 4889: 7% transfer rate meaning l will be paying how much to him
16/11/23, 5:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, you can use the mode of payment that you used to make the payment on your previous form of payment. Please choose the mode that is convenient for you at the moment.
16/11/23, 5:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Meaning you have to pay a total of $321
16/11/23, 5:35 pm - +263 77 244 4889: Ok will check with the bank rate if his rate is lower than the bank then l pay him
16/11/23, 5:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes Please, You are most welcome. Let me share a few insights into the PDM University with you -

This achievement signifies the university's significant growth over a mere five years.

20/11/23, 5:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once we get the same update, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application. So, you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. I would also like to add that in the event you want to wait for the next offer letter, you will be required to pay for the current offer letter in order to retain this offer if you want to back off from the next offer letter.
20/11/23, 5:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Regarding the registration fee that you are required to pay, it can be adjusted to the university of your choice, and you have the privilege to do that as you are an Edoofian. It is one of the benefits that we provide to our students in terms of affordability and choices.
20/11/23, 5:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: While the university provides various facilities, medical expenses are not covered under their purview. To protect international students from these expenses, students are supposed to get Medical Health Insurance.
20/11/23, 5:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and it is up to the student if they wish to get it from India or their home country, it would cost them around $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this and that this addresses the query you had?

If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of your offer letter or the university admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Rest assured, as promised, I am here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. 

Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
20/11/23, 5:30 pm - +263 77 244 4889: Yes l did
20/11/23, 5:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's fantastic to hear! As you explore this opportunity further, I am sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat. To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.
20/11/23, 5:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Valerie.vcf (file attached)
20/11/23, 5:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: She is a Zimbabwean Alumni who was among the first batch of Edoofians in 2017 who commenced their educational journey in India. She successfully completed her bachelor's in Computer Application, through the Edoofa program. 

Following her undergraduate studies, Valerie gained valuable work experience in India for a year before deciding to pursue her master's degree, also through the Edoofa Program. Her journey and experiences are a testament to the opportunities and support that the Edoofa Program offers.
20/11/23, 5:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you wish, you can contact Valerie to learn more about her experiences and insights regarding the program. Additionally, you could request her to share her Offer Letter, showcasing the professional opportunities she secured through Edoofa.

Valerie's father, a retired Police Officer in Zimbabwe, can also provide valuable insights into his daughter's experiences and the impact of the Edoofa Program on her education and career development in India. Feel free to reach out to them for a more comprehensive understanding of the program's benefits and outcomes.
20/11/23, 5:32 pm - +263 77 244 4889: We have managed to talk to both Valerie and his father
20/11/23, 5:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. May I know how you get the contact for them in the first place?
20/11/23, 5:35 pm - +263 77 244 4889: What about students visa do you cover that or it's on us
20/11/23, 5:36 pm - +263 77 244 4889: Was given by Ms Saloni
20/11/23, 5:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know.
20/11/23, 5:43 pm - +263 77 244 4889: And this
20/11/23, 5:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm delighted by your proactive approach, which demonstrates your genuine interest in pursuing higher education. Allow me to guide you through this process. The VISA fee amounts to $83 and must be submitted directly to the embassy by either the student, parent, or guardian for the purpose of biometric scanning. It's worth noting that this visa fee is a one-time payment and remains valid throughout your entire higher education journey in India. This falls within the scope of expenses that you'll be responsible for. I hope we are on the same page here?
20/11/23, 5:45 pm - +263 77 244 4889: And usually the air tickets are how much to lndia
20/11/23, 5:48 pm - +263 77 244 4889: Clear
20/11/23, 5:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The average cost of a flight ticket from Zimbabwe to India will be between $400 to $500 and will have to be paid by the student itself. The tickets are to be booked after one gets their visa from the embassy.

If you have a trusted travel agent with you, you will be able to go ahead and book your child's flight tickets on your own else, near the time of your arrival in India, we will share the contact details of a few trusted travel agents in Zimbabwe with you. I hope we are on the same page here?

20/11/23, 5:58 pm - +263 77 244 4889: And how's the weather there  in terms of clothing
20/11/23, 7:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please excuse me for the late reply. The weather here is decent and normal, not too hot in the winter and not too cold in the summer. I hope I am clear on this?
20/11/23, 7:25 pm - +263 77 244 4889: Clear
20/11/23, 7:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, I would like to discuss your plans for securing your scholarship seat so that we can communicate them with the university. 

As the university has set a deadline of November 28, 2023, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $300, or you can opt to pay the full $600 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you?
20/11/23, 7:39 pm - +263 77 244 4889: We are working on that  to make an initial payment of 300
20/11/23, 7:40 pm - +263 77 244 4889: And the other to be paid when
20/11/23, 7:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Understood! Taking steps toward the initial payment of $300 sounds like a good plan. It's great to see your progress in securing the scholarship seat. For the second deadline, it is on 28th of December!
