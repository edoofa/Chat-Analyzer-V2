07/09/23, 12:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Leroy,

I hope this message finds you well. I am *Mr. Shivjeet, Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As per our commitment, following the successful closure of the 2023 intake, I am delighted to inform you that we are now fully prepared to commence the university application process for your higher studies, targeting the intake of 2024. 

Before we embark on your admission journey, I'd like to inquire about your well-being and that of your family. How have the past few months been for you and your family?

As we come to the conclusion of the 2023 intake, I'm excited to provide you with a glimpse of our Proud Edoofians. With pride and anticipation, they embark on their higher education journey for the year of intake 2023. Their path is more than just academic; it's a profound journey of personal growth and the relentless pursuit of knowledge. This journey underscores our steadfast commitment to fostering a community where every Edoofian is not only educated but also honored with unwavering respect and care.

07/09/23, 7:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I now have a better understanding of the situation, and I appreciate you providing this information in advance. It's clear that Leroy may face some difficulties in attending school activities. I kindly request both you and Leroy to be aware that this is a family discussion group, and could also be proceeded exclusively with the parents as well. Your understanding of this aspect is greatly appreciated.
15/09/23, 3:21 pm - +263 71 248 1233: Thank you Sir.
15/09/23, 7:44 pm - +263 71 248 1233: She can be available for any communication that you might need since l am being much occupied with school as we prepare for the A Level ZIMSEC Final Exams.
14/10/23, 7:11 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and my dear Edoofian.

I hope this message finds you well. I regret to inform you that I was unable to proceed with our conversation recently due to unforeseen work commitments that required my immediate attention.

However, I am eager to catch up and continue our discussion. I am happy to let you know that I am available today a little bit early as it is the weekend and very much ready to take on our session with full productivity. Please let me know so that we can continue our session and wrap it up early.
14/10/23, 7:48 am - +263 71 422 2943: Good morning Sir.We are available and we can continue with our session.We are glad  to hear from you after such a period of not getting in touch.
14/10/23, 8:23 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Given our strong enthusiasm and meticulous preparation to advance your admission process, I would greatly appreciate your confirmation of your readiness to embark on this journey. So, may I kindly inquire if you are prepared to initiate the admission process at this time?
14/10/23, 8:38 am - +263 71 422 2943: Yes we are prepared to intiate the admission process.you will bear with me on the slowness if our Network this side
14/10/23, 8:38 am - +263 71 422 2943: ☝️on the slowness of our Network
14/10/23, 8:42 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for confirming your readiness to initiate the admission process. I understand and appreciate your patience regarding potential network challenges.
14/10/23, 8:42 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA (Psychology) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
14/10/23, 9:24 am - +263 71 422 2943: It is accurate Sir. This is definitely what l chose in the first place. Though l have come to develop a major interest in I.O Psychology specifically. Also l once asked on the Edoofa Instagram Page if it is possible to have a double degree ( BA in I.O Psychology and BA in Business Administration ). I would like to know if it is Sir and if Edoofa gives such chances to their students and if that same priviledge can be granted to me too. Is it also true that these courses are subject to change in the event that a student comes there and decide to change? If it is, it is upon this that l thought of changing into this branch of my course after considering more long term goals l developed after our interviews.
14/10/23, 9:26 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for confirming the accuracy of the information regarding your chosen course, BA (Psychology), and your planned arrival in India during August 2024. I appreciate your interest in the field of Industrial-Organizational (I.O) Psychology and the possibility of pursuing a double degree combining I.O Psychology and Business Administration. However, it is not possible to have a double degree in any universities in India.
14/10/23, 9:37 am - +263 71 422 2943: Also, it is also very true that l am planning to arrive in India in August 2024 Sir.
14/10/23, 9:39 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Along with that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry A-Level (If you do not have the A level Results).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
14/10/23, 12:20 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Ok thank you Sir.

16/10/23, 3:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon. I hope you are well and blessed. I was unable to connect with you further, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out.

Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
17/10/23, 3:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you are doing well and blessed. I am happy to let you know that I am now available to take our session. I would like to know if you are currently active and ready to proceed with the session?
18/10/23, 12:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings!

I trust this message finds you in good health. In the past few days, there has been some inconsistency in our conversation, which is leading to a delay in our session. *The session was ideally to be completed within 2 days, and most of your peers have already completed their admission process.*

I understand that there might be challenges that led to this inconsistency, and *I would like to inform you that any one of the available family members can be involved in this discussion as well.*

In light of this, the Academic Board has encouraged me to reach out so that we can complete our session on time and not miss out on the *opportunities* that lie in your admission process. Please do let me know if you were able to recieve my message so that we can speed up and move forward with the session.
18/10/23, 12:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: @263772721946 @263712481233 @263714222943
18/10/23, 1:35 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Noted Sir.Norah
18/10/23, 1:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would like to know if you are currently active and ready to proceed with the session?
18/10/23, 1:41 pm - +263 71 422 2943: As Leroy ' s mother i can be available for the proceedings .Leroy  was occupied with final A level exams but he will hve a break soonand will join us soon
18/10/23, 1:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand. Thank you so much for sharing the documents with me, it is well noted by the admission team. We are ready and excited to commence your academic journey for the year 2024. 

To proceed with our discussion, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure. I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure.
18/10/23, 1:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 3:40 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Very clear sir
18/10/23, 3:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Upon successfully paying the registration fee, your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account will be linked to the university's fee account. This allows you to use your EWYL credits to offset your annual university fees, providing you with financial flexibility throughout your education.

Additionally, after the registration fee payment, you will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, which is crucial for securing admission and obtaining your student visa. If you have any questions about the admission process or the associated costs for your higher education, please feel free to ask.
18/10/23, 3:47 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Thank you for explaining this admission process in a detailed way Sir.I do not have any questions as for now
18/10/23, 3:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
18/10/23, 3:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
18/10/23, 3:52 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Sure we are Sir.
18/10/23, 3:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
18/10/23, 3:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 3:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
18/10/23, 4:05 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Yes Sir, we are
18/10/23, 4:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

18/10/23, 4:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
18/10/23, 4:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
18/10/23, 8:52 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Yes Sir l have reviewed the bebefits and we can go on to proceed.
18/10/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
18/10/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
18/10/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, that an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
19/10/23, 1:05 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Good afternoon.That is good news Sir
19/10/23, 2:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon. I hope you are well and blessed. I was unable to connect with you further, as it was not my available hours by the time you reached out.

I am happy to let you know that I am now available to take our session. I would like to know if you are currently active and ready to proceed with the session?
19/10/23, 2:36 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Good afternoon Sir.Sure am now  available
19/10/23, 3:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
19/10/23, 3:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
19/10/23, 3:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
19/10/23, 3:14 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Yes Sir,it is
19/10/23, 3:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
19/10/23, 3:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
19/10/23, 3:54 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Yes Sir it is
19/10/23, 3:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
19/10/23, 3:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
19/10/23, 3:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 29, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 29, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 29, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
19/10/23, 4:17 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Absolutely nothing to enquire Sir , everthing is clear
19/10/23, 4:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
19/10/23, 6:37 pm - +263 71 422 2943: No Sir we are not aware, it will be great if you enlighten us more.
19/10/23, 6:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
19/10/23, 6:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
19/10/23, 6:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
19/10/23, 6:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
19/10/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if we are still connected?@263714222943
20/10/23, 4:43 am - +263 71 422 2943: Good morning Sir. I hope its morning there too.Sorry my netwlrk was poor.Howeveri i got everything that you explained in the last conversation.
20/10/23, 1:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon,

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. I was not able to respond to your messages by the time you have shared, as it was past my available hours. So, shall we connect this evening at 7:30 PM to further proceed with the session?
20/10/23, 2:17 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Yes Sir 7.30pm will do i will be available
20/10/23, 7:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Leroy.

I am excited to say that I am now available and active to guide you through the admission process. So, how are you spending this lovely evening?
20/10/23, 8:21 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Good evening Sir? Hope your day was fine.
20/10/23, 8:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes indeed it was great, thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
20/10/23, 9:21 pm - +263 71 422 2943: We are doing good Sir ,as a Friday when we won't be waking very early for every day's activities
20/10/23, 9:28 pm - +263 71 422 2943: My network is very poor though
20/10/23, 9:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I can understand that. In that case, may I know if we shall continue tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM to complete our session?
20/10/23, 9:49 pm - +263 71 422 2943: I am Sir, but my network is giving me problems.It is delaying to deliver messages
20/10/23, 9:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I can understand that and I was not able to get you. May I know if you are comfortable to proceed with the session tomorrow?
20/10/23, 10:12 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Sure sir,tomorrow will be fine at 8.oo am
20/10/23, 10:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great! We'll schedule our session for tomorrow at 8:00 AM. If you have any questions or need assistance in the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out. Have a good night, and we'll talk tomorrow.
20/10/23, 10:16 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Thank you very much Sir good night too
21/10/23, 8:47 am - +263 71 422 2943: Good morning Sir.
21/10/23, 9:08 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Leroy!

I hope you are having a fine weekend. I am happy to let you know that I am now available to take our session. I would like to know if you are currently active and ready to proceed with the session?
21/10/23, 9:23 am - +263 71 422 2943: Sure sir we are
21/10/23, 9:25 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
21/10/23, 9:50 am - +263 71 422 2943: I understand but i'm sure Leroy will not fail so these options do they apply to students who will fail their A level examinations?
21/10/23, 9:54 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, those are the outcomes for students who do not perform well in their A-level results. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
21/10/23, 9:54 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
21/10/23, 9:58 am - +263 71 422 2943: Noted Sir.Leroy will not fail his A levels .Be rest assured that he will produce the best results ever so we would be very grateful if we continue our session discussing with the benefits of the successful students.
21/10/23, 9:59 am - +263 71 422 2943: That is very good an offeredby thr Endowment Plan.
21/10/23, 10:09 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

I am happy to hear that and I understand this information is essential for everyone to know. Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
21/10/23, 10:09 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
21/10/23, 10:17 am - +263 71 422 2943: Yes Sir i'm clear about this.
21/10/23, 10:19 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
21/10/23, 10:19 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
21/10/23, 10:32 am - +263 71 422 2943: Everything seems clear Sir
21/10/23, 10:36 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Leroy's  guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Leroy is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
21/10/23, 11:03 am - +263 71 422 2943: Yes sir  we are

15/11/23, 12:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
15/11/23, 1:08 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Good afternoon sir.Yes sir i had a chance to go through the letter a bit and i am aware of what is expected of us.
15/11/23, 1:11 pm - +263 71 422 2943: My question is the international bank the only way of payment  like what we did last time of using one of our local banks.
15/11/23, 1:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I have taken note of that and please do not worry about that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
15/11/23, 1:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/11/23, 1:33 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Noted Sir.You can surely go ahead guiding us through   the admission process
15/11/23, 1:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 1:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/11/23, 1:46 pm - +263 71 422 2943: 1) 900us after the scholarship
2)3years (6 semesters)
3)300 which will be paved of by early registration
4) 750 Registration fee
15/11/23, 1:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/11/23, 2:10 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Yes Sir this is clarified
15/11/23, 2:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
15/11/23, 2:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/11/23, 2:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/11/23, 2:45 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Well explained Sir.
15/11/23, 2:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
16/11/23, 1:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope this message finds you well. I had been expecting to hear back from you, but it seems my previous messages may have been missed, causing a delay in discussing the offer letter. This delay might have led to missing out on this opportunity. Are you currently facing any challenges that are affecting our communication?
16/11/23, 4:07 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Sorry sir my schedule was bit tight today hence u failed to notify you on time.
16/11/23, 4:10 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Still on accommodation, will the scholarship cover the accommodation fare or the student has to save on his own?
16/11/23, 5:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing a great question the off campus housing are approved by us and by the time of arrival our Edoofian officials will be there there to allocate you Leroy with the accomodation of his choice along with his local friends as they will be staying near to each other. I hope you are clear on this ?
16/11/23, 5:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was hoping for a response from your end. I'll be concluding our session for today as I have another batch of students to attend to. It was a great time with our session, and let's plan to conclude our session tomorrow. So let us connect starting from 12:30 PM onwards tomorrow.

17/11/23, 7:18 am - +263 71 422 2943: Greetings Sir.
17/11/23, 7:18 am - +263 71 422 2943: I understand Sir. However, Sir what l need to understand is if the scholarship help pay the $2,000 sum for accomodation or Leroy will have to pay that alone without Edoofa's help?
17/11/23, 7:18 am - +263 71 422 2943: And about the clubs at the university, are Edoofa students or black students in general able to be part of those university clubs?
17/11/23, 1:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Leroy. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

The scholarships offered only extend to covering tuition fees only, leaving other expenses. However, at Edoofa, we go the extra mile to ensure that the financial relief we offer spans beyond mere tuition coverage. When we quote a range of $2000 to $3000 in support, it's not solely designated for tuition; it's inclusive of all other vital aspects of your education journey.

This support is intended to not only cover your tuition expenses but also cater to your accommodation and nourishment needs, ensuring a comprehensive support system for your educational pursuits. I will dive down more on the break up as we proceed with the session. I hope I am clear on this?
17/11/23, 5:48 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Thank you very much Sir. This is very clear.
17/11/23, 5:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now if you are ready shall we move on with the session?
17/11/23, 5:57 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Yes Sir. Sorry for the late reply, I was not on the phone for the most part of the day.
17/11/23, 5:57 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Yes we  can proceed Sir
17/11/23, 6:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright. Now, Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
17/11/23, 10:39 pm - +263 71 422 2943: My network has been poor today sorry for not communicating effectively today Sir.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
21/11/23, 2:14 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Sure it s clear Sir.but i have a question here.
21/11/23, 2:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely, please ask.
21/11/23, 2:23 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Since the student is far away is it possible for him to come to the campus to assess their options?
21/11/23, 2:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Indeed, that is the option available. The student has the liberty to come to the university and choose their accommodation. The university will provide the student with one day of accommodation for those options. I hope I am clear on this?
21/11/23, 8:43 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Ok .let' s say the student will view the accomodation the time he comes theee will there be any problem ti come once and for to cut the travelling costs .

21/11/23, 8:46 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Sorry sir for the communication breakdown.
21/11/23, 8:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The accommodations are situated near the university, and they are safe. Also, in terms of transportation costs, it is very convenient as it is very near to the university. It will be either walking distance or local transport for a quick and easy commute, which will not cost you more than $10 every month.
21/11/23, 8:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Coming to more about safety, the accommodations are guarded with 24-hour CCTV surveillance inside a society, and you will be living with your local friends as a community, which gives you pride and strength. Please let me know if you are clear here as well.
22/11/23, 12:54 am - +263 71 422 2943: Very clear Sir thank you.
22/11/23, 5:03 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Yes we are together Sir.May we have an option of paying  the 750  in two instalments if we can ask for the favour?
22/11/23, 5:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely, I am coming to that. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
22/11/23, 5:51 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Sure Sir.You may go ahead.
22/11/23, 6:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
22/11/23, 6:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
22/11/23, 9:28 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Yes Sir this is very clear.
23/11/23, 12:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Leroy!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. I was not able to connect with you further as it was past my available hours. With that in mind, I am now active and prepared to start our session and let us conclude the offer letter today. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
23/11/23, 2:42 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Yes we can proceed Sir
23/11/23, 2:44 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Sorry for the late response have travelled with school kids but we can proceed Sir.
23/11/23, 2:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries at all! It's great to hear that you're ready to proceed. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
23/11/23, 2:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
23/11/23, 3:20 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Yes sir we reside in Harare
23/11/23, 3:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
23/11/23, 3:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
23/11/23, 3:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
23/11/23, 3:36 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Thank u very much Sir.contact well received.
23/11/23, 3:46 pm - +263 71 422 2943: I had requested for a 2 instalment plan so is it us who discuss this with him ?
23/11/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The installment plan has been provided to you, and al the concerns are to be discussed with us, please.
23/11/23, 4:01 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Noted Sir.surely it was explained clearly earlier on
23/11/23, 4:01 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Noted Sir thank you
23/11/23, 4:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
23/11/23, 4:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
23/11/23, 4:20 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Sure Sir you cana provide us with the account details for Mr Shorwi.It will be a convenient way of payment for us than trying to meet Mr Rajan im person
23/11/23, 4:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

23/11/23, 4:42 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Thank you very much Sir.Will forward the proof of payment once the payment is done.
23/11/23, 4:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
23/11/23, 4:52 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Ok noted sir
23/11/23, 4:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
23/11/23, 4:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
23/11/23, 4:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
23/11/23, 4:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
23/11/23, 5:06 pm - +263 71 422 2943: That is a good program the Earn While You Learn .That will.lessen the burden in a great way.
23/11/23, 6:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
23/11/23, 6:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
23/11/23, 6:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
23/11/23, 8:39 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Yes it has clarified everything on how the EWYL credits can be helpful for fee payment.
23/11/23, 8:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
23/11/23, 9:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
23/11/23, 10:36 pm - +263 71 422 2943: I don' t have any question  as foe now Sir.
23/11/23, 10:37 pm - +263 71 422 2943: For now sir☝️.sorry fpr typing error.
