04/09/23, 3:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm delighted to learn that you are open to discussing this matter. Before we get into the specifics, I wanted to share a recent development that could significantly influence your educational journey.

Edoofa has recently established a partnership with a new university here in India. This collaboration has prompted the academic board to revisit scholarship opportunities for a select group of students, including yourself, with the intention of providing a more enhanced educational pathway.

Under this new collaboration, the university is offering more substantial scholarship opportunities for the course related to your field of study, particularly in the field of Medical Laboratory Technology.
04/09/23, 3:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Through this unique opportunity, you are in a position to secure a remarkable 90% scholarship on your tuition fee, along with a 100% sponsorship for your accommodation expenses. What's particularly striking is the potential to significantly alleviate the financial burdens tied to education. This could effectively bring down your annual expenses to just $1600, encompassing all essential aspects of your education and residence.

I am eager to hear your initial thoughts on this matter. Would you be interested in exploring this specialized course further and getting into the finer details of how this opportunity could potentially transform your educational journey?
04/09/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 897 3483: Yes sir lm interested
04/09/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know that you are ready to know more about the opportunity. Moving ahead, after thorough reconsideration of your application as well as a proper analysis of your documents, the academic board has suggested that you should pursue the course B.Sc. MLT for your higher education here in India for the given opportunity since it would help you in having a better career in the future as well as you would also be able to make your higher education even more affordable. I hope you understand?
04/09/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 897 3483: I do understand
04/09/23, 4:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, moving ahead Petronela, the name of the University is MVN University, and they are situated in the National Capital Region here in India. Moreover, their intake is about to begin since they have already released the dates for their students and that is in the month of September by the second week. Isn't that wonderful?
04/09/23, 4:05 pm - +263 77 897 3483: That's great news

11/09/23, 4:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, I would first like to understand why is it that you wish to know more about PDM University since I believe you were already aware of the same.

11/09/23, 5:12 pm - +263 77 897 3483: Do discuss

12/09/23, 1:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Hence, could you please take a moment to review your letter again and provide me with the following information:

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is your annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
13/09/23, 1:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Petronela!
I hope you are doing well today.
13/09/23, 1:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting you to respond to me earlier yesterday when we were having a discussion regarding your offer letter from MVN  University, however, since you did not revert back, we could not proceed.
13/09/23, 1:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: May I know by when can I expect you to connect with me here for the same so that we can proceed with the next steps in your admission journey?
13/09/23, 4:41 pm - +263 77 897 3483: Ok fine, may l know which tuition fee and which University preferably lam focusing on PMD
13/09/23, 4:47 pm - +263 77 897 3483: Thank you for the message ,l hope we can continue our discussion tomorrow morning by 10 am
14/09/23, 8:57 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Petronela!
I hope you are doing well today.
14/09/23, 8:58 am - Milan Edoofa: Regarding that, I would like to mention that for now, we shall focus on the offer letter that we have received from MVN University and once we have a clarity on the same, we will then discuss about finalizing your admission. I believe that would be okay with you, right?
14/09/23, 9:42 am - +263 77 897 3483: We are doing well thanks and how are you doing?

14/09/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 897 3483: Help ,help please this story of MVN is quite confusing coz the addimission thing is parrarel from the admission fee paid to PMD university may l know from you where do you want us to be with the unendless registration could please shade more light coz you wants told us about visa processing where is it,?
15/09/23, 11:56 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Petronela!
I hope you are doing well today.
15/09/23, 11:56 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please dear, thank you for sharing your doubts with me here. Let me first help you in getting clarity on the same. Moving ahead, I would like to know if we are connected with each other here so that we can move ahead to discuss the same?
15/09/23, 12:02 pm - +263 77 897 3483: Yes we are connected
15/09/23, 12:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Glad to hear that please. Now, on that note I would like to mention that, since you had already paid the admission fee of $750 at PDM University, and now that your application is processed at MVN University, you do not need to pay the admission fee again since the admission is not being processed parallelly, rather the amount that you paid at PDM will be adjusted towards your admission fee at MVN University and you would only have to bear the balance fee. I hope this is clear now? <This message was edited>
15/09/23, 12:39 pm - +263 77 897 3483: Thank you for getting in touch , ok may l know from you about the balance since we had cleared total amount as admission fee at PMD could you please indicate  the balance coz we have all the receipts for admission fee
15/09/23, 12:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear. I would surely help you with that. Before we come to it, shall we discuss about the offer letter and then during that conversation I would help you in understanding more about the same?
15/09/23, 12:44 pm - +263 77 897 3483: Ok, lets get to it
15/09/23, 12:53 pm - +263 77 897 3483: We are on the offer letter so al the monies stated there are they to be paid when the student is in class or the other way
15/09/23, 3:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Before we move ahead, please take a look at the letter and let me know of the following things:

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is your annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
15/09/23, 5:14 pm - +263 77 897 3483: 1.Tuition fee is 350                        Accommodation fee$0.             3.Annual fee $1600.               4.sports and misc $125.          Admission and processing fee $1000
16/09/23, 11:03 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Petronela!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/09/23, 11:03 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per your offer letter, MVN University has awarded you a 90% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you will only have to pay 10% of the per annum tuition fee for your course at MVN University, i.e. $350.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in your letter, you have also been awarded a 100% waiver on your accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided to you will be free of cost throughout your stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making your education more affordable, isn’t it?
16/09/23, 1:32 pm - +263 77 897 3483: I noticed that on the offer letter
16/09/23, 1:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as you can see in your offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
16/09/23, 1:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you would be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

Now, for the first year, you can see that there are two components that are one-time payable i.e. Sports Fee and Misc. Fee, so your total expenses for the first year become $1600 + $250 = $1850.

Please note that this cost is only for the first year, and from the second year onwards, your per annum cost of education will be $1600. I hope you are clear about that?
16/09/23, 1:42 pm - +263 77 897 3483: So when is money expected to be paid
16/09/23, 1:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes please dear, we are coming to that, before that, may I know if you are clear till here?
16/09/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 897 3483: The*
16/09/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 897 3483: Yes lm clear
17/09/23, 12:36 pm - +263 77 897 3483: Afternoon sir, we can now kick off with the programme
18/09/23, 3:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Petronela!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/09/23, 3:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, with that, shall we confirm that you would be going to MVN University for your higher education?
18/09/23, 5:53 pm - +263 77 897 3483: Yes indeed
19/09/23, 2:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Petronela!
I hope you are doing well today.
19/09/23, 2:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, moving ahead, as you can see the admission fee for MVN University is $1000, and since you have already paid $750 for your registration at PDM University, this leaves you with a balance of $250 to be paid in order to shift and confirm your admission at MVN. Can you please help me understand by when do you think you would be able to complete this payment as well so that we can move ahead with the next steps in your admission journey?
19/09/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 897 3483: Fair and fine could please grant me a favour to stagger my payment in two phases
19/09/23, 2:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, by when do you think that you would be able to make the payment in two parts please?
19/09/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 897 3483: First payment by end of this month of September

19/09/23, 3:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case I believe you are also focusing on the VISA and travel and that is why you are not able to complete all of the balance fee at once right?
19/09/23, 3:16 pm - +263 77 897 3483: Could you please shade more light on the visa issue and travelling moderlities
19/09/23, 3:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear. Here, I wanted to discuss about the finances required for VISA and flight tickets. I believe you must have raise the money for the same right?
19/09/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 897 3483: That's where lam l need to know all about it in terms of figures
19/09/23, 3:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are saying that you wish to know more about VISA and flight costs?
19/09/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 897 3483: Yes please
19/09/23, 3:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, for VISA, it would be $83 please, and for the flight costs, it would be $400-500 please.
19/09/23, 4:11 pm - +263 77 897 3483: Acknowledged sir,so let me try to make ends meet
19/09/23, 4:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. Now, on that note, I would advise you to complete the admission process as soon as possible, therefore, for the first, you can focus on clearing the admission fee and then involve in raising the other expenses, I hope you understand, right? <This message was edited>
19/09/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 897 3483: Understood sir
19/09/23, 4:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Regarding that, I would advise you to complete the payment of the balance fee as soon as possible so that we can atleast secure Petronela's seat with the university. For that, can you please let me know by when is the earliest that you can do that?

I had tried calling you in the afternoon so that we could have discussed about the next steps in your higher education journey and plan the way ahead, however, I believe due to network issues, you could not connect with me.
