I hope you are doing well, kindly excuse me for connecting with you yesterday, due to a national holiday known as Dusherra, and the other name for the same is known as Vijayadashami, which is a major Hindu festival celebrated in India. It marks the victory of Lord Rama over the demon king Ravana, symbolizing the triumph of good over evil. The festival is observed with various cultural and religious activities, including the burning of effigies of Ravana, elaborate processions, and the worship of Goddess Durga. Dussehra typically falls in September or October and is celebrated with great enthusiasm and fervor across the country.

In fact, for the first few days, there will be an orientation scheduled that parents can actively participate in.
25/10/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This orientation is just as crucial as your participation and provides valuable insights and guidance on the program's objectives and how parents can effectively support their child's educational journey.

26/10/23, 3:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Allow me to help you understand better. This fee of $500 to $1000 is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first-year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
26/10/23, 3:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you are aware we work with 250+ universities, so providing you with a list of them all is not possible for me. I understand your concern. However, being Indians, we are not only connected with Ministries in Zimbabwe but are also connected with the ones in India, and hence the university recommendations we get, are approved and directed from them. With this, you can rest assured that the quality of the university would be up to the mark and would be the right fit for you Isaac.
26/10/23, 3:46 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: Yap I have understood

26/10/23, 3:53 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: Yes
26/10/23, 3:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.

As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
27/10/23, 1:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.

I would like to inform you that our discussion tomorrow is scheduled for 01:00 p.m. I hope you will be available. Wish you a blessed night ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well!
04/11/23, 11:57 am - +265 997 17 19 93: Greetings! Ms Kirti
04/11/23, 12:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings to you too. Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
04/11/23, 12:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
04/11/23, 12:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course B.Tech (Civil Engineering) for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
04/11/23, 12:06 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: Yes
04/11/23, 12:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
04/11/23, 12:13 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: Yes I'm ready
04/11/23, 12:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
04/11/23, 12:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
04/11/23, 12:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
04/11/23, 12:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
04/11/23, 12:29 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: Yes but have you submit my application to multiple universities?
04/11/23, 12:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No, please this is just for your understanding we shall start submitting your application after step 4.
04/11/23, 12:36 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: Ok I have now understood
04/11/23, 12:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
04/11/23, 12:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
04/11/23, 12:52 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: So this $500 to$1000 will be just for registration not university fee is included?
04/11/23, 1:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Isaac I hope you recall that the registration fee is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first-year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
04/11/23, 1:41 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: Yes it's now clear
04/11/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, pelase. Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
04/11/23, 4:34 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: Yes
06/11/23, 12:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Isaac.

I hope you are doing well. By the time you responded it was past our available hours for Saturday so we were not able to connect with you. I would like to inquire if you will be available to connect with us now?
06/11/23, 5:52 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: I'm availabe now
06/11/23, 6:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, so may I know if you are clear so far?
06/11/23, 6:07 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: Yes is clear
06/11/23, 6:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1600 to $2300 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
06/11/23, 6:30 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: What if you remove accomodatin charges and food expnses
06/11/23, 6:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @265997171993 let me help you understand your query here. Ideally, the scholarships provided by the universities are only applicable to tuition fees, and accommodation and food are personal expenses. However, you are enrolled through Edoofa, and because of that it is an additional benefit that the students are offered. The cost range that we shared with you above of $1600-$2300 will include your tuition fee, accommodation, and food charges as well. Because we genuinely want to make education affordable for our students.
06/11/23, 7:40 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: Ok what if I choice to be stay outside the comes the cost will be the same?
06/11/23, 7:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @265997171993 each and every query of yours will be covered as we move ahead step by step, please I would encourage you to be a little patient.
06/11/23, 7:49 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: Ok
06/11/23, 7:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please so may I know if you are clear so far?
06/11/23, 7:51 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: Yes it's clear now
06/11/23, 7:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $800 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $800 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1800 per annum
*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
06/11/23, 8:17 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: That's great
06/11/23, 8:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1800 as per the above example.
06/11/23, 8:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1800 - $1000 = $800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $400 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $400 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
06/11/23, 9:32 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: Ok
06/11/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
06/11/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
06/11/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
06/11/23, 10:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you however, as it has been a long day for me and our available working hours are now over so let us reconnect tomorrow at 01:00 pm, have a great night ahead.
07/11/23, 1:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Isaac.

I trust this message finds you in good health. I had anticipated receiving a response from you, but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply although I did notice that you have read my previous message. May I kindly ask if we are still connected with each other?
07/11/23, 11:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have been looking forward to hearing back from you, but it seems the day has stretched on, and we've reached the end of our working hours. Let's aim to reconnect again tomorrow at 1:00 p.m. Wishing you a restful evening. Good night!
08/11/23, 1:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon to the Parents and Isaac,

I hope you are doing well. Kindly excuse me for not connecting earlier as I was occupied with a work meeting, however, we can connect now.

09/11/23, 1:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. So may I know if you are clear so far?
09/11/23, 1:19 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: Yes it's clear
09/11/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
09/11/23, 1:43 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: Cost of dmission process is how much?
09/11/23, 1:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @265997171993 the cost of education is the same $1600-$2300 that was informed to you by your counselors, please.
09/11/23, 1:55 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: Yes
09/11/23, 1:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
09/11/23, 1:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
09/11/23, 1:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
09/11/23, 1:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/11/23, 2:05 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: ThisOffer letter from the University I'll be different universities or just only one?
09/11/23, 2:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @265997171993 it will be different universities, however, I would please encourage you o be a little patient because as we move ahead with the step you will have a better understanding.
09/11/23, 2:09 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: Ok

11/11/23, 1:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings of the day.

I hope you are doing well. I would like to inform you that we will not be available as a team till the 13th of November and we will be connecting on the 14th of November on the occasion of Diwali also known as Deepavali, a major Indian festival often referred to as the "Festival of Lights." It's celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
11/11/23, 1:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.
11/11/23, 1:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/11/23, 1:42 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: Happy Diwali
11/11/23, 1:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your warm wishes.
13/11/23, 1:11 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: Greetings! Ms.Kirti
14/11/23, 12:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Isaac.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for your warm wishes. It was a great time with my family indeed. As we can connect now and move ahead with the discussions I would like to inquire if you are available to connect with us now?
14/11/23, 12:19 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: Yes I'm available
14/11/23, 12:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
14/11/23, 12:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
14/11/23, 12:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
14/11/23, 12:32 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: We can proceed in detail <This message was edited>
14/11/23, 12:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
14/11/23, 12:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level, MSCE and JCE results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
14/11/23, 12:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means Issac you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
14/11/23, 1:13 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: That means anyday I will receive letter of intent
14/11/23, 1:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
14/11/23, 1:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
14/11/23, 1:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/11/23, 2:15 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: Yes
14/11/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $850.
14/11/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $850. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/11/23, 4:48 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: Yes
14/11/23, 4:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
14/11/23, 4:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
14/11/23, 4:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $850, you'll need to make a payment of $425 on or before November 30, 2023. The remaining $425 should be paid by December 30, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
14/11/23, 5:02 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: Yes I'm following
14/11/23, 5:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
15/11/23, 8:57 am - +265 997 17 19 93: No
15/11/23, 8:57 am - +265 997 17 19 93: Good morning!
15/11/23, 2:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Issac.

I hope you are doing well. Since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
15/11/23, 2:55 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: I'm available now
15/11/23, 3:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter? <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 3:18 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: Yes I'm so excited
15/11/23, 3:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I ma glad to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
15/11/23, 3:29 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: That's so amazing, I'm so proud for that
15/11/23, 3:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Have a great day ahead Isaac and do convey my regards to your parents as well
15/11/23, 3:31 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: Thank you so much have good day too
15/11/23, 3:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.
22/11/23, 8:57 am - +265 997 17 19 93: Good morning!
22/11/23, 12:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Isaac.

I hope you are doing well, may I know if you want to share any thoughts of concerns?
25/11/23, 10:26 am - +265 994 08 92 88: @919650537098 
Good morning sir 
May I ask if it's possible to know the progress on the offer letter from the universities, because it's been long since you said  anything about it. The reason we want to know, is that we want to make plans and budgets so it will be nice to have that information soon.
25/11/23, 10:29 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Isaac.

I hope you are doing well. I understand your concern here. This is something I can not answer as I mentioned above the university 3-5 days to evaluate your application, and every university takes its own time as soon as we receive an update we shall update you please do not worry. However, we look at the positive side of this, you are getting more time to prepare your finances as well and you can save accordingly, right?
25/11/23, 11:08 am - +265 994 08 92 88: Yeah, we are preparing so that when the time come everything will be in place. Thank you for clarification
25/11/23, 11:10 am - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.
27/11/23, 10:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Isaac,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Quest Group Of Institutions* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
27/11/23, 10:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions.

27/11/23, 10:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 6:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Isaac,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
28/11/23, 6:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
28/11/23, 6:31 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: Good evening! Ms. Kirti
28/11/23, 6:31 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: I'm very glad for this oppottunity so that I can have chance to study a broad. I'm so greatful for  this
28/11/23, 6:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
28/11/23, 6:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
28/11/23, 7:05 pm - +265 994 08 92 88: Evening sir, we received the letter and much appreciation  for your effort, thank you so much
28/11/23, 7:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from the Quest Group of Institutes, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -
28/11/23, 7:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
28/11/23, 7:15 pm - +265 994 08 92 88: 1. Tuition fee after the scholarship is 1200
2. Accommodation 900
Registration fee 750
28/11/23, 7:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, as you can see in your offer letter from the Quest Group of Institutions, after the scholarship your per annum tuition fee is $1200.

Along with this, there is a $100 fee covering the university's regular examination fee, your uniform fee, library fee, and ERP Fee, along with other basic expenses such as the Wi-Fi facility. When you add this $100 to the per annum tuition fee of $1200, the total comes out to be $1300.
28/11/23, 7:18 pm - +265 994 08 92 88: That's noted
28/11/23, 7:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me also brief you on the accommodation as well:  The on-campus accommodations at the Quest campus have different categories and the pricing for every room is different as mentioned in your offer letter.
28/11/23, 7:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, all the international students prefer to stay off-campus as it is a lot cheaper and they get more freedom. We would advise the same for you. The university officials will help you find off-campus accommodations and help you settle in after you report to the campus.
28/11/23, 7:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you opt for accommodation outside the Campus, it would be comparatively cheaper, the cost will be around $500 per annum and that would include your food cost as well which means you would have to pay only $30 to $40 per month towards your living expenses making your per annum educational cost $1300  + $500 = $1800. I hope you are clear about this?
28/11/23, 7:22 pm - +265 994 08 92 88: I have a question, those the scholarship not cover the accommodation fee??
28/11/23, 7:23 pm - +265 994 08 92 88: Thats really good to know we will consider that
28/11/23, 7:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The scholarships offered only extend to covering tuition fees only, leaving other expenses. However, at Edoofa, we go the extra mile to ensure that the financial relief we offer spans beyond mere tuition coverage. When we quote a range of $1600 to $2300 in support, it's not solely designated for tuition; it's inclusive of all other vital aspects of your education journey.

This support is intended to not only cover your tuition expenses but also cater to your accommodation and nourishment needs, ensuring a comprehensive support system for your educational pursuits. I hope I am clear on this?
28/11/23, 10:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond. Since it has been a long day for me, and our available working hours for today are now over, l will be connecting with you tomorrow to continue with our discussion ahead. Have a blessed night ahead.
29/11/23, 6:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Isaac.

I hope you are doing well. I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not response since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
29/11/23, 6:10 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: Good evening Ms. Kirti
29/11/23, 6:10 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: Yes now I'm available
29/11/23, 6:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. So may I know if you are clear so far?
29/11/23, 6:16 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: Yah it's clear now
29/11/23, 6:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
29/11/23, 6:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
29/11/23, 6:46 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: Yes
29/11/23, 6:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of 1800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $1800 - $1000 = $800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.
29/11/23, 6:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
29/11/23, 6:51 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: Is this only offer letter from university or I'll be receiving other offer letter from universities.
29/11/23, 6:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
29/11/23, 6:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
29/11/23, 6:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
29/11/23, 6:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Quest Group of Institutes and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
29/11/23, 7:06 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: Yes it's clear
29/11/23, 7:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Quest, you would lose out on the scholarship from Quest and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
29/11/23, 7:42 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: Quest Group Of Institution it's good university
29/11/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please. Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Quest by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Quest without risking losing out on the scholarship.
29/11/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Quest to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Quest, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
29/11/23, 8:00 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: Yes
29/11/23, 8:02 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: This $750 we should pay at once or we can pay slowly?
29/11/23, 8:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving ahead, as informed, the registration fee of $750 mentioned in your offer letter will be adjusted against your first year's tuition fee, therefore the amount of tuition fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $1800 - $750 = $1050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $525 and $525, spaced 6 months apart.
29/11/23, 8:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The first installment can be paid either before arrival in India or within three days of arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.

I hope this clarifies the fee structure, and are we aligned on these options?
29/11/23, 8:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please we are coming to that discussion as well.
29/11/23, 8:10 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: But us we I'll consider to stay off-campus as it is cheaper
29/11/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please. Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
29/11/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
29/11/23, 8:13 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: Yes explain
29/11/23, 8:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of December 11th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of January 11th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
29/11/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before December 11th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
30/11/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Isaac 

I hope you are doing well. I hope this message reaches you in good health. I have been looking forward to a response from you following my previous message. However, I understand that you might not have had the chance to reply yet. Could you please confirm if we are still in communication?
30/11/23, 2:22 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: Good afternoon!
30/11/23, 2:26 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: I'm don't understand on this
30/11/23, 2:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand please, may I know if you recall that your registration fee as stated by you above in the letter is $750?
30/11/23, 3:10 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: Yes
30/11/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now if you recall our old conversation, through the Endowment program you were given a $150 grant on your registration fee, now when we see $750-$150= $600, this $600 for the registration fee can be paid in two installments of $300 each as per the deadlines given by the university above. 

May I know if you are clear now?
30/11/23, 3:46 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: Yes it's clear
30/11/23, 3:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, regarding the payment modes:

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter. As these are Indian account details, you won't find a corresponding account in Malawi. However, you can make a deposit into that account through a Telegraphic Transfer if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.

Alternatively, if you have access to a Visa/Mastercard, you can choose to make the payment through online modes such as Paypal or PayGlocal. Please inform me of the mode of payment that is suitable for you and your family, and I will assist you with the details accordingly.
30/11/23, 4:02 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: Though  National bank of Malawi
30/11/23, 4:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
30/11/23, 4:11 pm - +265 997 17 19 93: No
30/11/23, 4:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. In that case, let me also tell you a bit about the Quest Group of institutions. It is the most ideal destination for international students interested in studying in India. They have more than 200 International students from more than 15 different countries in Africa and Southeast Asia.
						
It has a Unique Mentorship program to encourage students to do well according to their abilities and strengths and has been awarded Outstanding Technical Institution of North India during the World Education Summit and Awards.
