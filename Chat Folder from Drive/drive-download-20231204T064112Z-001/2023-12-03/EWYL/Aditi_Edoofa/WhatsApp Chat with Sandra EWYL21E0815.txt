29/09/23, 1:14 pm - +91 78273 08969: Dear Sandra,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Aditi your new mentor will contact you on Tuesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Aditi's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.

I hope you are doing well.

 My name is Ms. Aditi Kapoor and I will be taking forward your EWYL journey from now onwards.🚀

Unfortunately, Ms. Tenzin won't be able to take your sessions from now onwards as she won't be continuing as your mentor due to her health concerns, but I wanted to make sure that you don't miss out on any learning and earning opportunities. 

During this duration, I had a conversation with Ms. Tenzin, and I am impressed with your ambitions and aspirations I am looking forward to helping you reach great heights in the future. And I can assure you that all your queries will be resolved and I will be working to help you in making this journey fruitful!💯 <This message was edited>

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 12:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Celebrate Diwali by lighting Diya's🪔, and capture the moment by snapping a photo of your lit and amazing celebration.🤩 Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.❤️

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

15/11/23, 4:58 pm - Aditi Edoofa: WEDNESDAY LESSON OF THE WEEK

Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.💡

I have worked hard every step of the way with you to enhance your performance and skills to do well in your project opportunities. In other attempts to meet our objectives, I have always tried to have a rewarding system that helps all our Edoofians earn considerable credits that help reduce the burden of their sponsors and parents back in their home country.

29/11/23, 3:39 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!

29/11/23, 3:45 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The essence of honesty and transparency in communication yields the best outcomes. Grateful for your presence in India, the goal is to extend that gratitude by sharing the conveniences of your new life, such as uninterrupted electricity and nearly free internet, with your loved ones. This project aims to hone your storytelling skills, fostering confidence, creativity, empathy, and perspective, while also enhancing presentation abilities. As part of the training, you'll guide others on sharing their stories and be empowered to select community members based on readiness. Your involvement continues with the deep engagement of shortlisting applicants post-training.
29/11/23, 3:48 pm - +91 86995 01895: Ok i understand ma'am
29/11/23, 3:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, from now on, you won't only be a student dedicated to community building; you'll also assume the role of an Edoofa certified student leader. This means you'll have an expanded responsibility in guiding and supporting your fellow students while continuing your valuable work in the community. Your role as a student leader is a significant step forward, and we believe it will bring about positive changes in your academic journey and community impact.

Only the forms submitted by the Edoofa Certified Student Leaders will be accepted. You will be given a certificate after you successfully complete your training on this project with your mentors.
