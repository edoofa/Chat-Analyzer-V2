I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to inform you that there has been a slight change in plans. Instead of having our session tomorrow, I will be conducting it today from 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm. The reason for this change is that I'll be on leave tomorrow as my mother has come to town, and I'd like to spend some time with her.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but I assure you that we will cover all the necessary topics during our session today. Please submit your Understanding of the Lesson before the session. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to me.

Thank you for your understanding, and I'm looking forward to our session today.

You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details. I would like to offer you the opportunity to have a focused discussion about the grant and its implications. Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 10:00am CAT AND 1:30PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Aditi your new mentor will contact you on Tuesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Aditi's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.

I hope you are doing well.

 My name is Ms. Aditi Kapoor and I will be taking forward your EWYL journey from now onwards.🚀

Unfortunately, Ms. Tenzin won't be able to take your sessions from now onwards as she won't be continuing as your mentor due to her health concerns, but I wanted to make sure that you don't miss out on any learning and earning opportunities. 

During this duration, I had a conversation with Ms. Tenzin, and I am impressed with your ambitions and aspirations I am looking forward to helping you reach great heights in the future. And I can assure you that all your queries will be resolved and I will be working to help you in making this journey fruitful!💯

10/10/23, 3:57 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings @918968010479 @263786171834 @27837992662 !

I hope this message finds you well. As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We will now hold our mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.

2. Additionally, we'll connect on alternate Wednesdays through WhatsApp. This chat-based format aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

You should share entirely about your journey, starting from the counseling stage till their arrival. You should share with the student that you paid your enrollment fee after getting eligible for the program and are informed about the cost of education in India before and after the Edoofa Scholarship which is far more affordable as compared to their home country.

) Student's journey so far with the program,
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) Highlighting the importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with your counselor and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Their initial feedback of how life is different in India how the basic amenities are cheaper as compared to your homeland (you may use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by themselves and struggling with the process. (you may refer to DSW's Help in explaining the normal process as compared to Edoofa's Process)
f) Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.

I hope this message finds you well. As we gather for today's session, I'd like to extend a warm welcome to you. Your participation is greatly appreciated, and I look forward to an engaging and productive discussion. Let's get started!"💯
08/11/23, 3:27 pm - +91 89680 10479: Evening mentor
08/11/23, 3:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: As your mentor, I have always strived to ensure you get enough opportunities to self-finance your
education. I have worked hard every step of the way with you to enhance your performance and skills to do well in your project opportunities. In other attempts to meet our objectives, I have always tried to have a rewarding system that helps all our Edoofians earn considerable credits that help reduce the burden of their sponsors and parents back in their home country.
08/11/23, 3:34 pm - +91 89680 10479: Yes yes
08/11/23, 3:34 pm - +91 89680 10479: Thank you Ms
08/11/23, 3:34 pm - Aditi Edoofa: However, a lot of you struggle at performing these projects and in pursuit of your success, here I am sharing a few key points that will help you excel at your projects.
08/11/23, 3:36 pm - +91 89680 10479: Ok fine
08/11/23, 3:42 pm - Aditi Edoofa: A big part of our journey as an Institution has been our community of students. I believe that we exist only because of our students. I am able to create opportunities because of our students and hence the Community Building Project is utterly crucial to us and our institution
08/11/23, 3:50 pm - +91 89680 10479: Ok ok l understand
08/11/23, 3:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Today we’ll be focusing on training you to ace this project. As all of you are aware the rewards/credits for this project have been revised and increased to 300$, which calls for better performance, increased effort, and a better approach to the project. Let’s learn more!
08/11/23, 3:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I have observed that honesty, transparency, and authentic conversations with people lead to the best results. Since you are here in India, and I am aware that a lot of you are grateful for it, the objective is to share that feeling with the things that you love in your new life. The sheer convenience of having a nonstop supply of electricity, and availability of internet that is almost as good as free- resources that were way more difficult to achieve back home, All of your brothers and sisters deserve those same opportunities.
08/11/23, 4:21 pm - +91 89680 10479: Yes of course
08/11/23, 4:22 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Sharing a story, even if it’s your own, is an art. It builds confidence, creative expression, empathy, and perspective and improves presentation skills. With this project, we are going to train you on all of these skills and also help you by sharing what you can actually tell them when you talk to them. I will also empower you to select students who you want to be a part of the community which will be based on your criteria of whether they are ready for this opportunity.

Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

15/11/23, 6:23 pm - Aditi Edoofa: WEDNESDAY LESSON OF THE WEEK

Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

Because Edoofa program offers guidence and assists you in your visa and also FRRO applications,And they are like our parents in this country.They also offers reasonable schoolarship percentages

3) Before you ask me what the Earn While You Learn Program (EWYL) is, let me explain
to you the uniqueness of the Edoofa Program.

As l said earlier they give guidence and councelling to us students.We also do lessions called. Webners which builds us in my skills so us as students we take advantage of that because other schoolarships they don't offer you that kind of oneness

25/11/23, 2:04 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Hello @918968010479 

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."✅

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.💡

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.💥

Best regards,
Team EWYL
25/11/23, 2:06 pm - +91 89680 10479: That's great ☺️..l will share my story
25/11/23, 2:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing! I will be waiting to hear your story.
25/11/23, 2:12 pm - +91 89680 10479: Ok ok nice

27/11/23, 12:56 pm - +91 89680 10479: Good evening ✨
27/11/23, 1:01 pm - +91 89680 10479: Yeah l think l can be eligible since according to my record  l am always present when you need me ,l also try my best to participate and raise questions and also l am present on webinars and so far l have one student l enrolled and in addition my younger brother is also processing things so that he can come here next year ..It's just one thing which l am still trying to achieve that's  to be on the Edoofa Newsletter
27/11/23, 1:01 pm - +91 89680 10479: So what do you think about me Mentor??
27/11/23, 1:18 pm - +91 89680 10479: People also ask
What is a spirit of competition?
Spirit of competition is a process of having focus attention and create individual ownership of the big picture goals of your shelf life. Competition leads to people doing their personal best ,being the driver for success, but it can also lead to bad ego driven mentality which undermines and destroys a life.Nevertheless As for me l was oncer a failure specifically in my educational part.What was eating me most is to see my own friends pass while l fail in my grades so it's just one day when l decided to break the ice and l took a next step of my life.So l was trying to make sure that everything l do must be 4 times as them.And to my surprise at the end of our semester l become the best of them all.I achieved this just because l accept myself to fight the spirit of competition and won the battle 

And also there is another thing which l am trying to conquer everyday and that's being a professional footballer...Me and footballer we are of the same watsapp group and l hope it's just one day when my dream will surely come true..😂
27/11/23, 1:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263786171834 @918968010479 @27837992662 ,

27/11/23, 3:40 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am so excited to finally bring out the much-awaited opportunity that you have been waiting for! This is a wonderful time for me as a mentor as a lot of my students are in the process of making use of the Edoofa Grant that was allocated before the start of this academic year and I am sure that you would be curious too.
27/11/23, 3:40 pm - +91 89680 10479: Yes yes
27/11/23, 3:42 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge (or the moment when the Grant was allocated to you by the founders of Edoofa - Mr. Angad & Mr. Avreen Singh); that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $200 annually. 
Do you remember this?
27/11/23, 3:44 pm - +91 89680 10479: Yes yes l remember that
27/11/23, 3:44 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great, let me help you out on this, 

1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University only if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
27/11/23, 3:48 pm - +91 89680 10479: Ok ok understood
27/11/23, 3:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
27/11/23, 3:50 pm - +91 89680 10479: Yes yes thank you for helping me indeed
27/11/23, 3:52 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
27/11/23, 3:58 pm - +91 89680 10479: Yes 👍 yes
27/11/23, 4:07 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
27/11/23, 4:13 pm - +91 89680 10479: Yes indeed that's the goal
27/11/23, 4:16 pm - Aditi Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
27/11/23, 4:16 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To make it simple for you to understand - considering a total of 6 sessions have taken place with me (2 in September & 4 in October), 6 webinars (4 in September & 2 in October), and positive attendance in the orientation session that took place at your University, you currently stand at:
27/11/23, 4:17 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Criteria	September + October
Webinar	        2/6
Attendance	5/6
Orientation	Present
Fee status	CLEAR

27/11/23, 4:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To avoid being confused, we have not included your performance in the month of November as it is still ongoing.
27/11/23, 4:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
27/11/23, 4:30 pm - +91 89680 10479: I want to know how you calculate my webners
27/11/23, 4:31 pm - +91 89680 10479: Yes

Hope you are well,

Are you ready for your grant Session?
28/11/23, 3:35 pm - +91 89680 10479: Yes ✋
28/11/23, 3:36 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Also, I can completely understand that you would have been occupied in University classes, assignments, and exams but let me highlight the story of our student Nicassio Simbarashe, who was given the grant opportunity and without compromising any call, any day, he worked on the projects with his utmost attention, attended all the webinars and session with his mentor without fail. For him, it was not an added responsibility, but he considered Edoofa and the time given by his mentor crucial for his personal and professional growth. Making him one of our top earners and best performers.

My aim is not to compare you with any other student but to help build a benchmark for you that we have a big scope for improvement and to showcase our best performance.
28/11/23, 3:39 pm - +91 89680 10479: Ok mentor
28/11/23, 3:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
28/11/23, 3:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Have a look at this so that we can discuss how you can achieve it
28/11/23, 3:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 3:50 pm - +91 89680 10479: Ok ok
28/11/23, 3:59 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So @918968010479 I would like to ask you what is your long term goal in regards of this program?

 As part of our ongoing commitment to your personal and academic growth, we have scheduled a special activity for this Saturday that involves reflecting on your EWYL (Explore, Wonder, Yearn, Learn) projects.

During this activity, we kindly request each of you to make a small analysis of the input and output of the work you have done in your respective EWYL projects. This analysis should include insights into the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of your efforts. Feel free to share your successes and any unexpected discoveries you made along the way.

Additionally, we encourage you to think about ways in which you can improve upon your results in future projects. This is an excellent opportunity to set goals for personal and academic development.

Remember, growth is a continuous process, and each project offers a valuable opportunity for improvement. We look forward to hearing about your experiences and aspirations.

Best Regards
TEAM EWYL!
