Let's appreciate the shared spirit of determination and celebrate this bond of freedom together.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts and insights. Wishing you all a reflective and joyful Independence Day! ☺️

17/08/23, 1:27 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 
Sure Edwin
17/08/23, 1:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Today, I am thrilled to introduce you to a scholarship program that has the potential to fulfill all the dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA - Education For All. EDOOFA, initiated by Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. in India, firmly believes that quality education should be accessible to all, irrespective of social or financial limitations. This exceptional scholarship program addresses the challenges of affordability and employability in higher education through its unique work-study model.


I am delighted to share that EDOOFA's scholarship program is currently benefiting over 100 schools in Africa, with more than 3000 African students already reaping its rewards. School principals and teachers who play a significant role in our program enjoy exclusive access to part-time Ph.D. programs. Additionally, EDOOFA's Earn While You Learn Program helps students reduce the financial burden of food and accommodation by providing opportunities to learn new skills and earn scholarship credits.

In Zimbabwe alone, EDOOFA has enrolled more than 1500 students in the program within the last year. Collaborating with over 100 schools, including partnerships with esteemed educational leaders such as Mr. Shorwi Kawadza, Principal of Hartzell High School, Mutare, EDOOFA has witnessed the success of more than 80 students who have already embarked on their journey to study in India.

Along with this, schools can be benefited in the following way:
1. Free Educational Counseling for Parents of ‘A-Level’/SHS Students looking to Study Abroad.
2. Quality Career Guidance Program for Learners to become eligible for 50-100 percent Scholarship on Tuition Fees in Degree Programs in Top Indian Universities.
3. Opportunities for Collaboration for implementing the best practices of the Indian Education System in progressive African Schools.
4. Facilitating your school-nominated teachers/academicians who have accomplished a Master's degree and want to pursue a higher academic qualification(PHD.)(Part-Time) on a 50-100 percent Scholarship.
17/08/23, 1:29 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,

 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
17/08/23, 1:29 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zambia where the tuition is *K19000-K2300*0 when calculating the yearly cost including student Amenities: K150+ Medical K200+ Union K150+Maintenance K200+Internet K200+Handbook K200 = K1100, then Hostel and Upkeep= K1000 per month or K12000 per Year. The total Per Year cost comes out to be: K33600 to K40000 which is equivalent to 1850 USD. Talking to seniors, I realized I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zambia.
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this was when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn $50-$100 per month throughout the course.

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zambia however it is not that easy. I *followed the 5’S* which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

10/10/23, 2:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: _*SESSION TIME FOR TOMORROW here on the EWYL GROUP- 7:00 pm to 8:00 pm*_
Make sure you are present and please acknowledge your availability
10/10/23, 2:43 pm - +260 97 2378942: I will be available
10/10/23, 3:04 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: That will be great Edwin. Take care
10/10/23, 3:24 pm - +260 97 2378942: Thanks and same
11/10/23, 3:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let's begin our session for today. First, kindly respond to the following questions with either "Yes" or "No":
1. Have you shared your photograph with me?
2. Have you provided your Facebook username?
3. Have you shared your Instagram username?
4. Have you written a review on Google and shared the screenshot with me?
5 Have you written a review on Facebook and shared the screenshot with me?
6. Have you shared your date of birth with me?
11/10/23, 3:36 pm - +260 97 2378942: 1. Yes
2. Yes
3. Yes
4. Yes
5. No
6. Yes
11/10/23, 3:38 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 3:38 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: You can take help from thesee videos and can complete the tasks after the session.
11/10/23, 3:39 pm - +260 97 2378942: Okay will do
11/10/23, 3:40 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I'd like to discuss our "Star of the Month" initiative, which is our $300 plan. Let me clarify why we introduced this plan. It's designed to help you achieve maximum results with minimal effort. 

However, it's crucial to use your smart strategies when reaching out to students. Are you employing effective tactics maximizing the potential of this plan and using smart methods to make the most out of this plan?
11/10/23, 3:45 pm - +260 97 2378942: I can’t say I am because I haven’t spoken to any new students in 2 weeks or so.
11/10/23, 3:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, I've noticed that students are making an effort, but it seems that the students coming to us don't have a good understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship program. Given the significant benefits you receive, we expect that the students who approach us should be well-informed about the program. Do you agree with this?
11/10/23, 3:48 pm - +260 97 2378942: I do agree yes
11/10/23, 3:56 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To address this matter, we've come up with a solution. We'd like you to create a testimonial video after your arrival in India. This video should cover:

a) Your journey with the Edoofa Scholarship Program so far,
b) Any initial concerns or uncertainties you had during the counseling stage,
c) Emphasize the significance of being proactive in counseling sessions and maintaining transparency with your counselor. Explain how these aspects eased your journey into the program. 
d) Share your initial impressions of life in India, focusing on how basic amenities are more affordable compared to your home country (e.g., inexpensive internet and unlimited calls). 
e) Discuss the advantages of being an Edoofian compared to applying through an agent and struggling with the process independently. 
f) Reflect on your university experience and highlight the differences from your home education system.
May I know that are we both on the same page?
11/10/23, 4:01 pm - +260 97 2378942: I’m terribly sorry but we aren’t.
I understand the assignment but I’m incapable of making a video of myself.
11/10/23, 4:04 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I understand your concerns, Edwin. However, to excel in life, you need to be well-rounded. You might feel unsure about making a video, but this is your chance to try, learn, and grow. Embracing the opportunity to make mistakes and learn from them is crucial. Do you agree with this perspective?
11/10/23, 4:12 pm - +260 97 2378942: I do agree with you. I don’t want to make any promises that I’d fail to keep by saying that I’ll make the video because I’m not entirely sure I can but I’ll try my hardest.
11/10/23, 4:13 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Certainly, the purpose behind creating this video is to ensure that you provide accurate and precise information to the students. Once you submit the video to me, I'll review and approve it. After that, you can share your video with the students. Does this clarify things for you?
11/10/23, 4:19 pm - +260 97 2378942: It does yeah but my issue is actually the fact that I completely fail to speak when a camera is pointed at me
11/10/23, 4:22 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Can you just ignore that you are speaking in front of the camera.
11/10/23, 4:28 pm - +260 97 2378942: I don’t think I can
11/10/23, 4:28 pm - +260 97 2378942: But I’ll try
11/10/23, 4:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, it was wonderful talking to you. I hope you had a good time as well. I truly value your active participation. I'll be in touch soon, and I wish you the best of luck with your exams
11/10/23, 4:29 pm - +260 97 2378942: Thank you
17/10/23, 10:05 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon Edwin

25/10/23, 3:42 pm - +260 97 2378942: Sounds interesting
25/10/23, 3:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, I trust that our Saturday call is still fresh in your memory. Allow me to provide a brief recap: During our conversation, we delved into the $300 plan and its associated training. Our primary focus was on the idea that honesty, transparency, and genuine interactions with students are the keys to achieving optimal results. |
Does this jog your memory?
25/10/23, 3:46 pm - +260 97 2378942: I remember yeah
25/10/23, 3:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I'm going to send you a document which you can read later, but for now, I want to take 5 minutes to go through the section titled *“Eligibility Criteria for an Applicant”*

May I know if is it clear?
25/10/23, 3:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/10/23, 3:48 pm - +260 97 2378942: Yes it is.
25/10/23, 3:49 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Have you gone through the topic, Edwin?
25/10/23, 3:50 pm - +260 97 2378942: Oh no I haven’t
25/10/23, 3:52 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, Please go ahead!
25/10/23, 4:01 pm - +260 97 2378942: I have read and understood it
25/10/23, 4:03 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the points for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
25/10/23, 4:11 pm - +260 97 2378942: I understand that only application forms from a certified Edoofa student leader will be accepted and that it’s the responsibility of the student leader to ensure that the individual to which the form belongs has a good understanding of what Edoofa is and how they operate.
25/10/23, 4:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Job! Now I would like to emphasize Step 1 today which was *You will reach out to the potential applicants via various channels*


May I know how you find new applicants or how to get new contacts?
25/10/23, 4:13 pm - +260 97 2378942: I honestly don’t know
25/10/23, 4:13 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would like to give you a few suggestions. 
1. First of all I hope you are aware that we are accepting applications for both 2024 and 2025 which means the students in U5 and U6 currently can fill up the application form. Correct?
25/10/23, 4:19 pm - +260 97 2378942: Correct
25/10/23, 4:19 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Excellent, now could you share the names of your 5 acquaintances who are currently in Africa, at either U5 or U6, and are available to help you with the contacts?

Write down their names along with their class. Don’t write the names of people who have already completed their A Level.
25/10/23, 4:34 pm - +260 97 2378942: I don’t have any
25/10/23, 7:58 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Regrettably, it's time to bring our conversation to a close, and I do wish we could have extended it further. However, we're set to reconvene on Saturday, which falls on November 4th, 2023. Please ensure you don't miss this important date.

22/11/23, 8:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good evening, Edwin*  
I trust you're doing well. Although it's a bit late, there's crucial information I need to share with you.

I hope you remember that you were granted Scholarship Grant 2023 by Mr. Angad during his meet and greet in Africa.

*Tomorrow, on the 23rd of November 2023, I've scheduled a session from 7:00 pm to 8:00 pm.* We'll have a comprehensive discussion about the grant during this time. Please ensure you don't miss it. Wishing you a restful Goodnight.
23/11/23, 12:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good Afternoon_*
I'd like to remind you about your session today for the Grant discussion. 
Before joining the session, kindly take a moment to review the Grant letter that I'll be sharing below.
23/11/23, 12:47 pm - +260 97 2378942: Okay
23/11/23, 12:50 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 3:32 pm - +260 97 2378942: Hello Ms Jasmine
23/11/23, 3:38 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good evening, 
I am delighted to discuss with you the proceedings of the grant, the one that you received from our esteemed founders, Mr. Angad Singh & Mr. Avreen Singh during their visit to Zambia. I hope you recall the event that I am talking about.
23/11/23, 3:41 pm - +260 97 2378942: Good evening 
Yes I do recall the event
23/11/23, 3:42 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now let me start this session by asking you about the importance and understanding of the Grant. So are you ready?
23/11/23, 3:42 pm - +260 97 2378942: Yes I am
23/11/23, 3:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Please go ahead and share
23/11/23, 3:48 pm - +260 97 2378942: Okay sure
I understand that the grant has been made possible so as to help me financially in terms of my school fees.
There are certain conditions that I must follow to maintain the grant like 75 percent attendance in both my classes and the EWYL session, and I must maintain a good grade and so on
23/11/23, 3:52 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments
23/11/23, 3:53 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
23/11/23, 3:58 pm - +260 97 2378942: I understand
23/11/23, 4:01 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant months ago? 

Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you deserving.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
23/11/23, 4:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasize that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you remember the announcement that was made by Mr. Angad Singh where he expressed the importance of being connected with the EWYL program and ensuring at least 75% of your engagement in all the opportunities, sessions & activities that would be provided by your mentors. You have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them and earn the highest amount of scholarship credits. You have the capability to not only earn credits far exceeding the grant value but also, completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
23/11/23, 4:10 pm - +260 97 2378942: Thank you
23/11/23, 4:21 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I'm providing you with a comprehensive FAQ document that addresses all potential queries. It's advisable for both you and your parents to review it thoroughly. If any additional questions arise, please make a note of them so that we can address them in our future discussions.
23/11/23, 4:21 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 4:32 pm - +260 97 2378942: Okay
I will read them over the weekend
23/11/23, 4:34 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I assume you've had the chance to review the Grant Letter. Now, I would really appreciate it if you and your parents proceed with signing the undertaking of the Grant Letter, which will serve as the formal acceptance of your grant.

Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride. It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.
23/11/23, 4:35 pm - +260 97 2378942: I will inform them thanks

25/11/23, 1:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: _*SATURDAY ACTIVITY*_
I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Also, I'd like to encourage you to share your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.
*Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.*

Do you remember this?
27/11/23, 2:55 pm - +260 97 2378942: Yes I do
27/11/23, 2:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Excellent Edwin, on the same lines, do you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? I hope you recall that to make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy a few guidelines that were stated obediently and thoroughly. 
Can you recall what they were?
27/11/23, 3:03 pm - +260 97 2378942: I think I can but I’m not entirely sure which part you are talking about. The closest thing I can remember to what you’re asking is the part on foregone Grant will not be carried forward to the
next year and  foregoing the lower value opportunity
27/11/23, 3:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Don’t worry, let me help you out on this, 

1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.

27/11/23, 3:19 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant months ago?

27/11/23, 3:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you deserving.

Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future. <This message was edited>
27/11/23, 3:49 pm - +260 97 2378942: Thank you
27/11/23, 3:53 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasize that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you remember the announcement that was made by Mr. Angad Singh where he expressed the importance of being connected with the EWYL program and ensuring at least 75% of your engagement in all the opportunities, sessions & activities that would be provided by your mentors. You have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them and earn the highest amount of scholarship credits. You have the capability to not only earn credits far exceeding the grant value but also, completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
27/11/23, 3:57 pm - +260 97 2378942: I will thanks
27/11/23, 4:01 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
27/11/23, 4:31 pm - +260 97 2378942: I really appreciate it and you thank you so much🙏
27/11/23, 4:37 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
27/11/23, 4:43 pm - +260 97 2378942: Yes
27/11/23, 4:49 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
27/11/23, 4:49 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
27/11/23, 4:50 pm - +260 97 2378942: I am aware
27/11/23, 4:52 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To make it simple for you to understand - considering a total of 6 sessions have taken place with me (2 in September & 4 in October), 6 webinars (4 in September & 2 in October), and positive attendance in the orientation session that took place at your University, you currently stand at:
27/11/23, 4:54 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 4:59 pm - +260 97 2378942: May I ask, I’m I above or below 75%?
27/11/23, 5:05 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Your session attendance with me is 100% but your webinar attendance is less than 75%
27/11/23, 5:33 pm - +260 97 2378942: Thank you
27/11/23, 5:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, it is time to wrap up the session. 
Since we have not completed the session, I will schdule one more session tomorrow. Make sure you are on time. 
Goodnight!
28/11/23, 10:44 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Afternoon* @260972378942 
I hope you are doing well. 
_*Grant Discussion: Your Performance and Eligibility*_
This is to remind you that since we were unable to complete our discussion yesterday. *I have scheduled one last session for you.*
Make sure you come on time. 
I am sure we will have a lot to discuss. 

*Date: 28/11/2023*
*Time: 6:00 PM IST*

28/11/23, 1:20 pm - +260 97 2378942: Good evening Ms Jasmine I’m so sorry but could we reschedule to next week because I have a lot of assignments due tomorrow and back to back continuous assessments until Saturday.
28/11/23, 2:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Evening Edwin*
I hope you are doing well. 
*IT'S TIME FOR THE SESSION*

May I know do you remember our yesterday's conversation? <This message was edited>
28/11/23, 2:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Thank you so much
28/11/23, 2:36 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: No, Edwin, I want to wrap up Grant discussion by today. 

It will not take more than 30 minutes and I ma sure you can take out at least 30 minutes from your day.
28/11/23, 2:38 pm - +260 97 2378942: Okay sure
28/11/23, 2:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
28/11/23, 2:41 pm - +260 97 2378942: I do
28/11/23, 2:42 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: That is wonderful, Edwin I would like to make it clear that your Total Grant Amount is $1200 and the total scholarship credits that you have earned until now are $52. With this, my goal is clear, to not only ensure that you are active throughout the EWYL program’s sessions and activities but also to surpass the total Grant amount so that you can cover the next semester's fees on your own, or at least to a significant extent through the Scholarship Credits.
28/11/23, 2:45 pm - +260 97 2378942: Yes I understand
28/11/23, 2:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, considering your recent performance, I would like to ask you, are you willing to work with me on the projects constantly, every day for the next 45 days as I envision a journey that can craft a future that brings pride and joy to both you and your parents and help you pay the next semester’s fee!
I hope that you are ready and excited.
28/11/23, 2:54 pm - +260 97 2378942: I’m sorry but my honest answer to this is that I’m not that willing to. Back in Zambia I tried working on the projects everyday because I didn’t have the stress I do right now and I have exams in the next two weeks which go up until January so even if I were completely willing to work on the projects I wouldn’t be consistent with them because my mind would be split.
28/11/23, 2:54 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, So are you okay in giving up the Grant amount?
28/11/23, 3:02 pm - +260 97 2378942: Could I have a discussion with my parents and get back to you on this
28/11/23, 3:02 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Sure Edwin
28/11/23, 3:04 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: How much time, will you take Edwin?
28/11/23, 3:04 pm - +260 97 2378942: A few minutes
28/11/23, 3:05 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: That will be great
28/11/23, 3:11 pm - +260 97 2378942: Is this the only period that I can work on the projects or could I do it over the holidays or atleast after exams
28/11/23, 3:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Edwin, the decision to work on the projects and earn scholarship credits is in your hands. However, what I do expect from you is consistent attendance in all sessions and webinars. Once you've completed your exams, you can certainly focus on the projects.
28/11/23, 3:28 pm - +260 97 2378942: Okay thank you
28/11/23, 3:29 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
28/11/23, 3:29 pm - +260 97 2378942: I understand that completely
28/11/23, 3:30 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Have a look at this so that we can discuss how you can achieve it
28/11/23, 3:30 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 3:35 pm - +260 97 2378942: Sure
28/11/23, 3:37 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that I believe if you do perform as per this, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can confirm that if this performance goes then you can surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. But there is no limit to how much you can finance yourself and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits but let me set a desirable goal that you can achieve in this span.
28/11/23, 3:37 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would want you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.
28/11/23, 3:50 pm - +260 97 2378942: I’m honestly not sure
28/11/23, 3:50 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: What I believe is very simple, you have to be consistent in all the calls and EWYL Group sessions, and in these sessions only I will be sharing ideas that can help you to level up your performance in the project exponentially. Another thing that you have to keep in mind is attending all the webinars without fail because they teach us skills beyond the four walls of the classroom.
28/11/23, 3:51 pm - +260 97 2378942: I think I can do that
28/11/23, 3:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I have full faith in you and you to realize that this opportunity is not yet lost. We can do our level best and seize the opportunity to self-finance ourselves. Just remember one thing, consistency and dedication are definitely the keys to excel and I believe that you have the potential to do it.
28/11/23, 4:14 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Our conversation regarding the grant has concluded.

It was a pleasure discussing this matter with you.
Wishing you a delightful evening, Edwin.
28/11/23, 4:35 pm - +260 97 2378942: It’s been a pleasure talking to you too
