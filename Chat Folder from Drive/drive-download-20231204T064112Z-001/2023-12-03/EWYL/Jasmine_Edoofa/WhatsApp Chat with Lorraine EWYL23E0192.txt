I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 10:16 am - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, there will be *you will get your Wednesday Lesson today*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.
Kindly come on the EWYL LINE and type *LESSON*

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

08/11/23, 3:58 pm - +91 83978 22536: *What l have understood*

The Diwali festival,is the festival of lights.The  culture belief on this festival is victory of good over evil.It is associated with the return of Lord Ram's return to Ayodhya after defeating the demon king Ravana.Also ,it is associated with the worship of Goddess Laxmi , goddess of wealth and prosperity.
People like candles and invite her into their homes.
Since this is done by a family and community ,it strengths their bond.Another significance is that it fosters a spirit of unity and compassion as families and people in the society will be sharing gifts through charity or communal feasts.The festival also stands as a reminder that love, forgiveness and understanding are essential ingredients for a harmonious fulfilling life

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Also, I'd like to encourage you to share your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.
*Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.*

27/11/23, 2:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
27/11/23, 2:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.

27/11/23, 2:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To make it simple for you to understand - considering a total of 6 sessions have taken place with me (2 in September & 4 in October), 6 webinars (4 in September & 2 in October), and positive attendance in the orientation session that took place at your University, you currently stand at
27/11/23, 2:50 pm - +91 83978 22536: Yes we are on the same page

27/11/23, 2:59 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To avoid being confused, we have not included your performance in the month of November as it is still ongoing.
27/11/23, 3:00 pm - +91 83978 22536: Okay so l get the update after the month end or after two months
27/11/23, 3:00 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: After the month end Lorraine
27/11/23, 3:06 pm - +91 83978 22536: Okay mam
27/11/23, 3:09 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I would like you to take a minute to absorb these figures and reflect on the objectives of the EWYL program for a while - which was to become 

A) Job-ready (via your sessions with your mentors and the constant industrial exposure - webinars)

B) Self-financing your education (via earning scholarship credits by working on the projects consistently).
27/11/23, 3:22 pm - +91 83978 22536: Yes l have get it
27/11/23, 3:23 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Moreover, By the end of this semester, that is December, there will be a total of 12 mentor-based sessions and 10 webinars, hence, it is crucial that you mindfully attend all the reserved activities that we have set up for your benefit and attend them regularly and work on the projects with my training in place, I am 100% sure that you will surpass the Grant amount that is allocated to you and earn more scholarship credits as there is no limit to the total number of credits that you can earn. That is my priority for you in the next 45 days.
27/11/23, 3:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Before I move ahead, May I know if you have any questions that you would like to ask?
27/11/23, 3:24 pm - +91 83978 22536: Okay
27/11/23, 3:25 pm - +91 83978 22536: No l have no questions
27/11/23, 3:26 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
27/11/23, 3:28 pm - +91 83978 22536: Yes l believe l'm ready
27/11/23, 3:30 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: That is wonderful, Lorraine. I would like to make it clear that your Total Grant Amount is $1000 and the total scholarship credits that you have earned until now are $21. With this, my goal is clear, to not only ensure that you are active throughout the EWYL program’s sessions and activities but also to surpass the total Grant amount so that you can cover the next semester's fees on your own, or at least to a significant extent through the Scholarship Credits. <This message was edited>
27/11/23, 3:31 pm - +91 83978 22536: Clear and understood
27/11/23, 3:33 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, considering your recent performance, I would like to ask you, are you willing to work with me on the projects constantly, every day for the next 45 days as I envision a journey that can craft a future that brings pride and joy to both you and your parents and help you pay the next semester’s fee!
I hope that you are ready and excited.
27/11/23, 3:36 pm - +91 83978 22536: Yes l'm ready 
But did you say we will be doing the projects everyday ...
27/11/23, 3:42 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I will share the timetable where we will meet thrice a week.
27/11/23, 3:43 pm - +91 83978 22536: Okay sure
27/11/23, 3:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
27/11/23, 3:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Have a look at this so that we can discuss how you can achieve it
27/11/23, 3:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 3:47 pm - +91 83978 22536: Okay
27/11/23, 3:47 pm - +91 83978 22536: Yes let's discuss
27/11/23, 3:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that I believe if you do perform as per this, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can confirm that if this performance goes then you can surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. But there is no limit to how much you can finance yourself and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits but let me set a desirable goal that you can achieve in this span.
27/11/23, 3:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would want you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.
27/11/23, 3:53 pm - +91 83978 22536: I do not understand where it is written ,expected enrollment 4-5+
27/11/23, 3:54 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Are you aware of Community Building? <This message was edited>
27/11/23, 3:59 pm - +91 83978 22536: Yes l am

27/11/23, 4:05 pm - +91 83978 22536: Yes l'm aware
27/11/23, 4:09 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: So, this is written in the table. The target for December is more than 4-5 enrollments
27/11/23, 4:10 pm - +91 83978 22536: Okay ok l get it
27/11/23, 4:11 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: What I believe is very simple, you have to be consistent in all the calls and EWYL Group sessions, and in these sessions only I will be sharing ideas that can help you to level up your performance in the project exponentially. Another thing that you have to keep in mind is attending all the webinars without fail because they teach us skills beyond the four walls of the classroom.
27/11/23, 4:15 pm - +91 83978 22536: Okay noted
27/11/23, 4:17 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I have full faith in you and you to realize that this opportunity is not yet lost. We can do our level best and seize the opportunity to self-finance ourselves. Just remember one thing, consistency and dedication are definitely the keys to excel and I believe that you have the potential to do it.
27/11/23, 4:19 pm - +91 83978 22536: Thank you for your faith in me
27/11/23, 4:21 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Allow me to summarize our discussion. We've assessed your performance from *September to December*, and currently, you are not eligible to redeem the grant due to your past performance. *However, with one month remaining, if you actively participate in all calls, sessions, and webinars, there's a chance you could become eligible*.

Furthermore, I encourage you to focus on engaging in projects to accumulate scholarship credits for yourself.
