08/11/23, 4:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _*Wednesday Wisdom and Saturday activity are back!*_

Well, I understand that it has been a while since we last connected for your Wednesday lesson and Saturday Activity. I realize that all of you had just arrived and were busy settling down, managing your timetables, attending the EWYL sessions, and handling administrative tasks such as processing FRRO and fee-related matters, in addition to your regular classes.

However, starting from now, we will resume our Wednesday Wisdom and weekend activities!
08/11/23, 4:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is your wednesday lesson!

Today's lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 2:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings!

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

15/11/23, 3:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, as you move forward, you will read the 'International Student Admission Eligibility Check' and some sample questions for verification. 

Kindly read that!
15/11/23, 4:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I was expecting a response from your end, but since our session time is over, I am concluding today's session here.

15/11/23, 4:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

25/11/23, 5:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_URGENT_*

Even after many messages and reminders, you have not been able to complete your $300 training session with me. However, since this means a lot to me, and I believe in the impact it will have on your journey, I am here sharing the grant document with you and something discussed during the training.

So, I would like you to read and provide a step-by-step summary of how to proceed with the community-building project. Only after this will you be provided with the "Certified Student Leader" certificate.

25/11/23, 5:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *2.  As you move forward, you will read the 'International Student Admission Eligibility Check' and some sample questions for verification.*

You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it. This will help you guarantee that you have effectively communicated your information. For this, we have another step "International Student Admission Eligibility Check"

Now, as an Edoofa Certified Student Leader, your responsibility is to share these questions with the student, evaluate their answers, and check the student's eligibility.
If you notice any discrepancies, you should guide them to make the necessary corrections before sharing the form with me.
25/11/23, 6:15 pm - +91 73407 66315: OK.  Thank you
29/11/23, 7:44 am - Ananya Edoofa: *_Reminder: EWYL Group session is back!_*

Remember that I have set some goals for you and now it has become my personal agenda to see you achieve that.

29/11/23, 1:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Panashe! @263779788175 @917340766315 


After scheduling multiple sessions with you for your $300 training, you could not attend those sessions. Being your mentor, I was concerned about you getting a certificate for student leadership. I even shared the pointers with you without you asking for them. Even after that, you could not share a 4-5 step summary with me?

It breaks my heart to see that even after so many efforts, you never reciprocate, even if these things are for your own benefit. After giving you a lot of days and considering everything, today I will be finalizing the list for Certified Student Leaders at 8:00 PM. If you can, submit your understanding before that.
29/11/23, 2:35 pm - +91 73407 66315: How are you
29/11/23, 2:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Thank you for asking, Panashe! I am doing good.
29/11/23, 3:04 pm - +91 73407 66315: I am well. I was at LPU and we did the Google review
29/11/23, 3:04 pm - +91 73407 66315: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 3:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great, then why didn't you share your understanding about the $300 plan?
29/11/23, 3:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Have you read this message?
29/11/23, 3:08 pm - +91 73407 66315: Oh . I'm sorry.  I forgot

29/11/23, 3:43 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Before we delve into today's session, I'd like to share an inspiring story about one of my batchmates, Raghav Kapoor who was just a regular university student. A few weeks ago, I came across a post of his showcasing his own company, which has achieved significant turnover within two years.
29/11/23, 3:53 pm - +91 73407 66315: Oh really! What is his company of?
29/11/23, 3:55 pm - +91 73407 66315: It's talking about the community building.  It was mainly discussing about how to approach and how to inspire other students about the edoofa program, Including the fees and benefits of Indian education
29/11/23, 4:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Raghav began building his small business under the guidance of multiple successful entrepreneurs and recently secured investment from one of the major firms in India. As his batchmate, I couldn't be prouder, and I reached out to congratulate him.
In our conversation, I asked him about the journey—how he initiated and scaled his business to such heights. 
Well, you won't believe what he responded. I was in utter shock. Can you guess?
29/11/23, 4:04 pm - +91 73407 66315: I think he said it was because of community building in that he had a huge connections to sponsorship
29/11/23, 4:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, he revealed that there were no big connections or resources, basically from the beginning of his university years, he has been an active participant on LinkedIn—he started building connections, talking to various entrepreneurs, learning skills under them, and securing internships just to maximize his exposure. Not only this, but if he has an investor that too just because of building a quality network over LinkedIn.
