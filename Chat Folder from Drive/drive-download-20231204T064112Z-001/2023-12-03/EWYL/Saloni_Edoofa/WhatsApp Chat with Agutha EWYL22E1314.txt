28/09/23, 5:47 pm - +263 78 759 4595: Noted
28/09/23, 9:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Agutha!

This is awesome, you all look so nice!
28/09/23, 9:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, let me do that.
28/09/23, 9:18 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - *EDOOFA -Education For All.*

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *a lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as a mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
28/09/23, 9:18 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of* more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
 
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
28/09/23, 9:18 pm - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
28/09/23, 9:18 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
28/09/23, 9:18 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
28/09/23, 9:18 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

28/09/23, 9:18 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You know, Edoofa is also working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr. G.M Chipare. We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Herewith I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.

This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

15/11/23, 3:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,

27/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 759 4595: Good evening ma'am
27/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 759 4595: Yes we can begin
27/11/23, 2:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am so excited to finally bring out the much-awaited opportunity that you have been waiting for! This is a wonderful time for me as a mentor as a lot of my students are in the process of making use of the Edoofa Grant that was allocated before the start of this academic year and I am sure that you would be curious too.
27/11/23, 2:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge (or the moment when the Grant was allocated to you by the founders of Edoofa - Mr. Angad & Mr. Avreen Singh); that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $200 annually. 

Do you remember this?
27/11/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 759 4595: Yes I'm very curious
27/11/23, 2:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Excellent Agutha, on the same lines, do you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? I hope you recall that to make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy a few guidelines that were stated obediently and thoroughly. 
Can you recall what they were?
27/11/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 759 4595: Yes I remember ma'am
27/11/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 759 4595: I only remember that I had to attend all the session with maximum participation in all the provided activities that's all I remember
27/11/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 759 4595: As for the specific guidelines I don't remember
27/11/23, 2:50 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is great!
27/11/23, 2:50 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Don’t worry, let me help you out on this,
27/11/23, 2:50 pm - Saloni Edoofa: 1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University only if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
27/11/23, 3:15 pm - +263 78 759 4595: I'm following
27/11/23, 3:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
27/11/23, 3:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
27/11/23, 3:20 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 3:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: We will continue our discussion tomorrow from 06:00 - 07:00 PM, please make sure you come on time for the session.
27/11/23, 3:38 pm - +263 78 759 4595: OK ma'am thank you
28/11/23, 8:51 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon Agutha,

I trust this message finds you well. I wanted to inform you that there has been a slight change in our schedule. Since I have a family event tomorrow, I need to reschedule our *EWYL Group session* for *today from 07:00 PM to 07:45 PM*. I hope this adjustment is convenient for you. Your participation is highly valued, and I look forward to our session later. If you have any concerns or conflicts, please feel free to let me know🚀
28/11/23, 9:00 am - +263 78 759 4595: Afternoon ma'am
28/11/23, 9:00 am - +263 78 759 4595: Noted ma'am
28/11/23, 10:01 am - Saloni Edoofa: We will have our session on the *GRANT* that you received, where we will talk about your performance and eligibility *today* from *06:00 - 07:00 PM* in the *EWYL Group only*.
It is necessary that the parents are there in the sesion.
28/11/23, 2:29 pm - +263 78 759 4595: Good evening ma'am
28/11/23, 2:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May we begin with our session?
28/11/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 759 4595: Yes we can
28/11/23, 2:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Did you study this Agutha?
28/11/23, 2:52 pm - +263 78 759 4595: Yes ma'am I did
28/11/23, 2:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To avoid being confused, we have not included your performance in the month of November as it is still ongoing.
28/11/23, 2:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
28/11/23, 2:55 pm - +263 78 759 4595: Yes ma'am I believe so and I know I'm ready to my effort
28/11/23, 3:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is great Agutha!
28/11/23, 3:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
28/11/23, 3:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Have a look at this so that we can discuss how you can achieve it
28/11/23, 3:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 3:03 pm - +263 78 759 4595: I have looked ma'am .
What's expected enrollment?
28/11/23, 3:10 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that, I believe, if you do perform, as per the above, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can surely confirm that you will surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. There is no limit to how much you can earn via the scholarship credits and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits. In our aim to do so, let us break the process into steps by first setting a desirable goal that you can achieve in this timeline. The primary requirement for us to achieve the goal of earning more than the Grant amount is your regular connection with me as a mentor and your dedication to working on the project. I hope that you are ready to take on this challenge with me.
28/11/23, 3:10 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would like you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.
28/11/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 759 4595: We can achieve by connecting regularly. Also with your guidance and assistance including my participation I think we can achieve this
28/11/23, 3:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, you can Agutha and you have to work on it!
28/11/23, 3:20 pm - Saloni Edoofa: What I believe is very simple, you have to be consistent in all the calls and EWYL Group sessions, and in these sessions only I will be sharing ideas that can help you to level up your performance in the project exponentially. Another thing that you have to keep in mind is attending all the webinars without fail because they teach us skills beyond the four walls of the classroom and it directly caters to the idea of you becoming job-ready.
28/11/23, 3:21 pm - +263 78 759 4595: Noted ma'am thank you
28/11/23, 3:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I have full faith in you and you to realize that this opportunity is not yet lost. We can do our level best and seize the opportunity to self-finance ourselves. Just remember one thing, consistency and dedication are definitely the keys to excel and I believe that you have the potential to do it.
28/11/23, 3:26 pm - +263 78 759 4595: Thank you so much ma'am for believing in me. I really appreciate
28/11/23, 3:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You're always welcome Agutha!
28/11/23, 3:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So, what do you think right now, how will you take things forward now?
28/11/23, 3:30 pm - +263 78 759 4595: Now I will just have to challenge myself and have the spirit of competition
28/11/23, 3:30 pm - +263 78 759 4595: I'm forwarding my Saturday activity to you ma'am
28/11/23, 3:31 pm - +263 78 759 4595: Spirit of competition is the desire to achieve success and the desire to win .

Spirit of competition to me it means the ability to do everything that makes you successful. That desire that I have to achieve something is the same thing that makes me work hard ,study smart and  being well behaviour. 
It has really influenced my approach to challenges and goals because when you really desire something  yo do everything possible to achieve it. 

Back in 2020 during the COVID lockdown I wasn't studying and I knew that I had my O level exams. We had a chance to go to extra lessons. The day we went there we were given a small test in all the eleven subjects we were doing. I was the only one who did bad it was so embarrassing really. 
I challenged my self and I had the desire to make it on the final exam which is the spirit of Competition. I had only 4 months to go at that time. I worked hard in studying and I took extra classes and it worked because I had the spirit of Competition. . That's how I see and define the spirit of competition...
28/11/23, 3:33 pm - Saloni Edoofa: We will end the session today and will resume on Thursday since I won't be available tomorrow due to some personal commitments. I will let you know the time of the session tomorrow only.
Thank you for joining in!
28/11/23, 3:35 pm - +263 78 759 4595: Thank you also for being my mentor and more
28/11/23, 3:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Always Agutha!
28/11/23, 3:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May we begin with our weekly EWYL Group session?
28/11/23, 3:38 pm - +263 78 759 4595: Yes we can begin
28/11/23, 3:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I truly appreciate your thoughtful reflection on the spirit of competition. Your personal experience during the challenging times of the COVID lockdown in 2020 demonstrates the transformative power of this spirit. Your determination to overcome the initial setback, work hard, and take extra classes is commendable. It's evident that the desire to achieve success, coupled with the spirit of competition, has positively influenced your approach to challenges and goals.

Your story serves as an inspiration to others, showcasing the impact of a strong work ethic, smart studying, and maintaining good behavior. It's a testament to the resilience and dedication that the spirit of competition instills in individuals, propelling them to achieve their aspirations.

Congratulations on your successful journey, and may your continued spirit of competition lead you to even greater accomplishments in the future! Keep up the excellent work! 🌟
28/11/23, 3:43 pm - +263 78 759 4595: Thank you so much ma'am
28/11/23, 3:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So Agutha, may I know what updates you have made on the $300 plan?
28/11/23, 3:54 pm - +263 78 759 4595: OK for the $300  plan it's been going well. For my plan to work I had to create session time with the students who are really interested in joining Edoofa .
28/11/23, 3:56 pm - +263 78 759 4595: In the sessions I share with the students what Edoofa is , how it is beneficial. I also share with then my testimonies and I give them the platform to ask questions for their clarity.
28/11/23, 4:00 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is awesome, so how are you finding these students?
28/11/23, 4:08 pm - +263 78 759 4595: Through my friends  back in Zimbabwe and my family I had asked them to refer students who are interested in studying abroad to me
28/11/23, 4:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is great Agutha, I just want you to know that there is no limit on the credits you can earn, simply sky is the limit. Have a look at these students who are pushing all the limits and breaking the boundaries👇🏼
