18/08/23, 2:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So Chris, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
18/08/23, 2:23 pm - +263 71 220 9118: We’ll my long term goals include being financially independent and such be a first class citizen of the society. To me personally that means being able to help others that are disadvantaged. I also want to develop professionally and pursue the career that I love
18/08/23, 2:30 pm - +263 71 220 9118: I think that the program can help with the financial needs that come with going to University such as basic upkeep etc.  Generate enough to relieve my parents of some of the financial pressure. Taking some of the pressure onto myself
18/08/23, 2:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Your sessions will be held from next week, Monday onwards from 01:30-02:30 PM.

Till then, have a great weekend🌺
18/08/23, 2:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This message was deleted
21/08/23, 1:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you.
21/08/23, 1:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am so happy to hear about them and I promise to contribute to your growth as much as possible.
21/08/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
21/08/23, 1:42 pm - +263 71 220 9118: No could you please elaborate
21/08/23, 1:50 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
21/08/23, 1:50 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
21/08/23, 1:53 pm - +263 71 220 9118: Okay thank you for enlightening me. I now fully understand the objectives. Really looking forward to it
21/08/23, 2:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am glad that you have understood them.
Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
21/08/23, 2:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/08/23, 2:12 pm - +263 71 220 9118: I have gone over the screenshot.Wow I would like to learn how he generated all these credits and hopefully do the same
21/08/23, 2:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am sure that together we will achieve even higher milestones together🌟
21/08/23, 2:26 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
21/08/23, 2:30 pm - +263 71 220 9118: I would like to thank you all for the effort and support. Hope to get to know you all and working together to reach even greater milestones 🙏🏽
21/08/23, 3:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
21/08/23, 3:18 pm - +263 71 220 9118: Ok thank you
22/08/23, 1:32 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

May we begin with our session📖
22/08/23, 1:46 pm - +263 71 220 9118: Yess
22/08/23, 1:47 pm - +263 71 220 9118: Hello how are you 
We may begin
22/08/23, 1:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing good, thank you.
22/08/23, 1:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Of course Chris, even they are humbled to welcome you in the group.
22/08/23, 1:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with Edoofa Program, we will be connected even when you are here in India. 
Let me share about myself…
22/08/23, 1:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please let me know if you face any problems while viewing the video.
22/08/23, 1:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/08/23, 2:00 pm - +263 71 220 9118: I have watched the video 
And I can truly see that you are passionate about helping your students grow and achieve success.
22/08/23, 2:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I hope you did get an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with you.
22/08/23, 2:10 pm - +263 71 220 9118: Yes I have . I am excited to be interacting with someone who is also passionate about what they do. I have always liked Economics too so we are alike in that regard. May our journey together be a fruitful one
22/08/23, 2:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am so happy to hear about myself, really glad to have a student like you.
22/08/23, 2:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
22/08/23, 2:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/08/23, 2:24 pm - +263 71 220 9118: Thank you for sharing the newsletter.I am done reading reading the newsletter.
23/08/23, 1:44 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

May we begin with our session🫱🏻‍🫲🏼
Please excuse me for the delay, got occupied in an urgent call.
23/08/23, 1:47 pm - +263 71 220 9118: I’m fine 
Hello how are you 
It’s no issue We may begin
23/08/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you.
23/08/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
23/08/23, 2:00 pm - +263 71 220 9118: Id have to say The Hall of Inspiration section. I could probably relate to that one more because I face some of the challenges that she went through.
23/08/23, 2:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am happy to hear that!
23/08/23, 2:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Chris?
23/08/23, 2:05 pm - +263 71 220 9118: That sounds achievable!
23/08/23, 2:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I enjoyed our conversation, I am certain, you would have a better understanding of what your EWYL journey is going to look like, full of knowledge and opportunities to grow and develop yourself. This will be all for today, let us connect tomorrow as I have more in store for you. I would like to focus tomorrow's discussion on making you familiar with our schedule once again and also share what is expected from a dedicated Edoofian. Before we end our discussion for the day, I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from today’s discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
23/08/23, 2:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *Are you ready for the questions?*
23/08/23, 2:15 pm - +263 71 220 9118: Yes I am ready
23/08/23, 2:18 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube

4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is.
23/08/23, 2:36 pm - +263 71 220 9118: 1 ) So on my EWYL there’s Saloni who is my mentor and will be guiding me through the EWYL program. There’s also Ms Deepali who I think is the group administrator for the EWYL program who manages group discussions and there’s also Mrs/Ms Davi who is my head mentor who provides the curriculum for the EWYL program.


2 . The goals of my mentor (Saloni Rastogi) include developing skills that  can make me employable when I finish my degree program. The other is for me to self finance my university by acquiring credits


3 A a weekly newsletter 

4 - It is where we celebrate the successes of fellow edoofians and they can share their experience in the edoofa program. You get see how fellow edoofians are doing and how they overcame challenges.
23/08/23, 2:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
24/08/23, 1:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

25/08/23, 1:43 pm - +263 71 220 9118: I’m doing well thank you
How are you ? 
Yes we may begin
25/08/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing good, thank you.
25/08/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, that’s wonderful. Chris- I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
25/08/23, 2:08 pm - +263 71 220 9118: So basically the document speaks on developing 21th century skills such creative content writing and data analytics to name a few. It then goes on  to talk about two Projects. The first about Corporate alliances and the second about community building
25/08/23, 2:18 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This is awesome, you have got it right!
May I know what have you learned about the second and third project?
25/08/23, 2:25 pm - +263 71 220 9118: Project 2 is about reaching out to the community and recruiting potential members of the  Edoofa ecosystem. This is done by reaching out to senior secondary students who have graduated and referring to apply for the edoofa program 


Project 3 is about reaching out to Local schools where I live and talk to the leaders of the schools to collaborate with Edoofa. You try to proctor a meeting between the school authorities and the edoofa team.
28/08/23, 1:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, I have noted that.
29/08/23, 11:37 am - +258 87 213 7357: Good day @918002312433 Apologies on behalf of Chris he won’t be able to attend today's session because Schools are opening Sunday and he’s getting ready

How are you?

May we begin with our session📖
29/08/23, 1:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since I want you to have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your exams. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
29/08/23, 1:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Deepali, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till ___ (date) because I am having my exams from __ to ___ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Saloni as soon as I get over with my exams.

Once done, please let me know.
16/09/23, 10:24 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
16/09/23, 10:24 am - Saloni Edoofa: If you are not available as a student, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Saturday* from *08:00 AM - 09:30 AM* from next week onwards⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.
17/09/23, 3:38 pm - +258 87 213 7357: Good day sorry for the late responses, we are available to complete the initial sessions when you are free, thank you.
21/09/23, 10:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day! I hope you're doing well.

I wanted to inform you that due to the _organization being closed this Saturday_, our next session will be rescheduled to the following week, specifically on *Wednesday, September 27, 2023* _12:00-01:00 PM_. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

In the meantime, I'd like to share my brief introduction video with you, which will provide some insight into who I am. Additionally, I encourage you to explore our weekly newsletters. These newsletters serve as a direct connection between our founder, Mr. Angad Singh, and all of our fellow Edoofians. It's a powerful medium through which we can learn from his experiences and wisdom. Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to our session next week.

30/09/23, 8:15 am - Saloni Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Chris will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same. <This message was edited>

07/10/23, 8:15 am - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Chris can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
07/10/23, 8:18 am - +258 87 213 7357: Absolutely, we are
07/10/23, 8:23 am - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey, these are mandatory to follow. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.


When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceeding with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know.
07/10/23, 8:43 am - +258 87 213 7357: Chris is not available right now l, he will only be available in November after exams, he is in boarding school, if you can wait that would be wonderful
07/10/23, 8:43 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, I am completely with you on this, just that these are some mandatory formalities that need to be performed before Chris takes over her journey the date you have mentioned on the availability of the student. I will not begin anything before Chris is present for sessions with me. Just that these are certain basic mandatory requirements that need to be fulfilled.
07/10/23, 8:45 am - +258 87 213 7357: Noted, much appreciated. Chris will get in touch as soon as he finishes his exams.
07/10/23, 8:49 am - Saloni Edoofa: These are some basic formalities that need to be completed.
07/10/23, 8:49 am - Saloni Edoofa: We have to do some basic formalities.
07/10/23, 8:49 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now there are some basic formalities that you need to follow.
07/10/23, 8:49 am - Saloni Edoofa: All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
07/10/23, 8:49 am - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
07/10/23, 8:49 am - Saloni Edoofa: You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
07/10/23, 8:49 am - Saloni Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
07/10/23, 8:49 am - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
07/10/23, 8:53 am - +258 87 213 7357: Noted let me get on it
07/10/23, 8:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once this is done, do let me know.

16/10/23, 7:32 pm - +263 77 290 0604: I find it inspiring by hearing about how other  successful people perceived life and how their  approach managed to make them successful like Henry Ford.
16/10/23, 8:14 pm - +263 77 290 0604: Learning about other students " experiences brings the idea closer to  home as it is easy to identify with them and to challenge Chris to also take risks and strive to do more
