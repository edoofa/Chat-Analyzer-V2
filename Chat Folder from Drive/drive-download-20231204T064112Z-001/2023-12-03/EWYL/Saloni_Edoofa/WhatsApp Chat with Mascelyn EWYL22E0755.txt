I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
15/09/23, 4:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: In case you, as a student, are not available, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Monday and Thursday* from *12:30  PM to 01:30 PM*⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.

04/10/23, 9:47 am - Saloni Edoofa: You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
04/10/23, 9:47 am - Saloni Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
04/10/23, 9:47 am - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
04/10/23, 9:56 am - +263 77 503 7285: I'm you Edoofian parent,so it means I will register her name because she is at school. Cellphone are not allowed at their school

04/10/23, 10:23 am - +263 77 503 7285: Okay
17/10/23, 8:26 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day to our proud edoofian and parents!

I would appreciate it if you share your thoughts on the same once you read the above-shared newsletter.
Even parents can do it on behalf of the student.
26/10/23, 9:19 pm - +263 77 636 4787: I think it's the same with  Easter for us but it's just being celebrated in different ways because during Easter we believe that Jesus managed to cheat death when he resurrected from the dead same as in Dussehra you believe that Lord Rama's triumph over the demon King Ravana
26/10/23, 9:19 pm - +263 77 636 4787: So tell me more about this Dussehra
27/10/23, 1:00 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Waiting for this message
