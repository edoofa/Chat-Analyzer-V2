26/12/23, 6:21 PM - +267 74 197 595: Yes l am
26/12/23, 6:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
26/12/23, 6:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
26/12/23, 6:24 PM - +267 74 197 595: Yes l agree
26/12/23, 6:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
26/12/23, 6:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
26/12/23, 6:26 PM - +267 74 197 595: The exams were already written in November 2023 and we are waiting for the results that will be out early February 2024
26/12/23, 6:27 PM - +267 74 197 595: So there is no reappearance
26/12/23, 6:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand. *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
26/12/23, 6:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
26/12/23, 6:34 PM - +267 74 197 595: Yes l m clear
26/12/23, 6:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
26/12/23, 6:41 PM - +267 74 197 595: I m understanding point 1 and 2
26/12/23, 6:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/12/23, 6:46 PM - +267 74 197 595: I have no queries
26/12/23, 6:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As Nyashadzashe's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that he is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
26/12/23, 6:48 PM - +267 74 197 595: Yes
26/12/23, 6:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day evening and please extend our regards to your family as well. We will only be able to share your application with the universities when you will be able to share your letter of recommendation or the statement of entry for A level

26/12/23, 7:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, in that case, may I know when are you planning to connect with them again?

We are looking forward
17/1/24, 1:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
17/1/24, 1:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
17/1/24, 1:51 PM - +267 74 238 400: 1. 900
2. 3 years
17/1/24, 1:52 PM - +267 74 238 400: 3.$ 300
17/1/24, 1:52 PM - +267 74 238 400: 4. $750
17/1/24, 1:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
17/1/24, 1:52 PM - +267 74 197 595: 1 The tuition is 900 usd
2 standard duration of course is 3 years
3 procedure fee 300usd
4 registration 750usd
17/1/24, 1:53 PM - +267 74 238 400: Yes its clear
17/1/24, 1:53 PM - +267 74 197 595: Yes it clarifies
17/1/24, 2:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
17/1/24, 2:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
17/1/24, 2:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
17/1/24, 2:06 PM - +267 74 197 595: I would like to ask on campus accommodation  is the money paid once off or interms
17/1/24, 2:09 PM - +267 74 197 595: Then is it shared equally amongst the 3 seater or it's an amount per head
17/1/24, 2:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your concern, however, may I know which accommodation are you referring to before I help you understand?
17/1/24, 2:45 PM - +267 74 197 595: I m referring to the on campus accommodation
17/1/24, 2:46 PM - +267 74 197 595: Is the 2000 usd divided amongst the 3  students or it's charged per head and is it a once off payment or to be paid in terms
17/1/24, 4:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I have taken note of your concerns. I would love to continue with our discussion however, for now, I will not be available to connect since I am heading for my dinner break, so let us reconnect tomorrow at 12:30 pm CAT so that we can continue with our discussion without any issues, have a blessed day ahead and do convey my regards to your family as well.
17/1/24, 4:39 PM - +267 74 197 595: Alright
18/1/24, 3:46 PM - +267 74 197 595: Good afternoon Sir 
I was thinking we can get clarity on accommodation issues today
19/1/24, 9:53 AM - +267 74 197 595: Good morning Sir
