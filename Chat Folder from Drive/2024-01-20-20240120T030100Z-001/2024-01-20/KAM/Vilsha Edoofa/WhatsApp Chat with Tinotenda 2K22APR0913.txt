18/1/24, 12:00 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning Mr. Gilbert, Mrs. Rhoda, and Tinotenda,

This is *Ms. Vilsha, I serve as the Head of Admissions* at Edoofa. Recently, I was reviewing the application files for students who enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program for the academic intake of August 2023 but were unable to join the universities at that time.
18/1/24, 12:01 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: During this process, I noticed that Tinotenda was one of the students who aspired to pursue a Diploma in Business Administration but faced challenges due to unsatisfactory O Level results, particularly in the subject of Mathematics.
18/1/24, 12:02 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Given the passage of time since our last conversation, I wanted to personally reach out and inquire about how you and your family have been doing. How are things on your end?
18/1/24, 12:18 PM - +263 77 388 8768: Yes,we are praying that her O level results especially mathematics will be good this time around so that she pursue her studies
18/1/24, 12:40 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Absolutely, Mr. Gilbert. We understand the importance of Tinotenda's O-level results, especially in Mathematics, for her pursuit of studies. We are confident that she will be able to clear her exams and will be well-prepared to focus on her studies. As always, our thoughts and best wishes are with her.
18/1/24, 12:41 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: I also noticed that Tinotenda is not a part of her admission group any longer. I believe she must have faced a technical challenge with her device because of which she left the group. Could you please check with her if she is in a position to rejoin and reconnect with us so that we can understand how her exams went and help her plan the way forward for her education?
18/1/24, 12:43 PM - +263 77 388 8768: Definitely will check with her why she exited the admission group
18/1/24, 12:53 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for the update, Mr. Gilbert. I have requested Mr. Piyush @919958440855, your career counselor at Edoofa, to make you an admin of Tinotenda's admission group and I believe he has done the same.
18/1/24, 12:53 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Once you check with Tinotenda, you can also add her back to the group so that we can reconnect with her as well. Once you do the same, please let me know! I am looking forward to connecting with you and your family.

18/1/24, 1:54 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for sharing Tinotenda's contact, Mr. Gilbert.
18/1/24, 1:54 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Also, good afternoon, Tinotenda. I am *Ms. Vilsha, the Head of Admissions at Edoofa*. I recently had a conversation with your father, who mentioned that you have completed your exams and are expecting your O-level results this week. Therefore, I wanted to reach out to you and inquire how your exams went?
