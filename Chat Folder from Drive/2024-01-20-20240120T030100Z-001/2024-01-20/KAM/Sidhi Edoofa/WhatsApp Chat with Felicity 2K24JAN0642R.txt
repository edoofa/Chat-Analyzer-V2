18/1/24, 11:44 AM - +260 763007542: Yes madam I'm ready
18/1/24, 11:59 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
18/1/24, 12:00 PM - +260 763007542: Yes madam
18/1/24, 12:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 12:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, I would encourage you to go through the above image representing your university admission process and once you are done, let me know so that I can explain the same to you in detail.
18/1/24, 12:07 PM - +260 763007542: You may explain madam
18/1/24, 12:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
18/1/24, 12:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
18/1/24, 12:11 PM - +260 763007542: Quite understood madam
18/1/24, 12:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counselling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counselling session will take about 1 hour.
18/1/24, 12:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
18/1/24, 12:21 PM - +260 763007542: Yes madam I'm following up
18/1/24, 12:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
18/1/24, 12:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
18/1/24, 12:28 PM - +260 763007542: Yes madam understood
18/1/24, 12:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.

18/1/24, 12:36 PM - +260 763007542: On the statement of purpose I'm I the one supposed to write or it's the Edoofa team
18/1/24, 12:37 PM - +260 763007542: Yes madam
18/1/24, 12:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a very vital document for your application, as it serves as a personalized and comprehensive document that highlights your motivations, qualifications, and goals, providing admissions committees with valuable insights into your application. Since it is a subjective document, your inputs are quite important. After taking your detailed inputs, the Edoofa team will provide assistance in improving or improvising your SOP and then include the same in your application profile. As we proceed with our sessions, you will gain more clarity on the same. I hope this was helpful?
18/1/24, 12:53 PM - +260 763007542: Yes madam it is
18/1/24, 12:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright, moving on to the first step of the admission cycle i.e., *Message from the founder’s office*. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
18/1/24, 12:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. You may take today’s time for the same. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?
18/1/24, 12:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
18/1/24, 1:01 PM - +260 763007542: Yes madam I'm ready
