16/1/24, 1:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey.

I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
16/1/24, 1:38 PM - +260 97 1819712: I'am settled for the discussion,may we start please.
16/1/24, 2:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 2:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, I would encourage you to go through the above image representing your university admission process and once you are done, let me know so that I can explain the same to you in detail.
16/1/24, 2:16 PM - +260 97 1819712: I've gone through it madam.
16/1/24, 2:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
16/1/24, 2:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
16/1/24, 2:18 PM - +260 97 1819712: Yes I'am clear.
16/1/24, 2:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
16/1/24, 2:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
16/1/24, 2:36 PM - +260 97 1819712: All clear,Thank you!
16/1/24, 2:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
16/1/24, 2:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
16/1/24, 2:48 PM - +260 97 1819712: Well understood madam.
16/1/24, 2:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
16/1/24, 3:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: @260971819712 may I know if you were able to go through my previous message?
16/1/24, 4:08 PM - +260 97 1819712: Of course I did go through all the steps madam they're all understood,thank you!. 
My apologies on the  letter of recommendation not submitted at due,it's unfortunate that my school administration couldn't complete it on time,

16/1/24, 4:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
16/1/24, 4:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
16/1/24, 4:58 PM - +260 97 1819712: Before we proceed madam,please allow me to take you a little bit back on the recommendation letter.it seems the letter is requesting a combination of A level subjects of which I do not posses but only O level results,O level students graduate up to grade 12 as the setup of education here in Zambia.
So how do I go about the process in this situation madam?
16/1/24, 4:59 PM - +260 97 1819712: Noted!
16/1/24, 5:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I will discuss this with you once we are done with today's session, please. Now, should I proceed?
16/1/24, 5:00 PM - +260 97 1819712: Yes please!

I've learnt about exercising openness,having an open mind and taking the inquiry further in a task given at hand be it hard or soft.
Secondly the founders mentioned  on adhering to instructions which is most important to meet the life transforming education provided by Edoofa.
Lastly is to never hesitate to seek help from mentors and experts as they are like my parents on my career journey.
16/1/24, 6:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Ramona, I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection.

17/1/24, 8:44 AM - +260 97 1819712: <Media omitted>
17/1/24, 9:02 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Ramona! How are you all doing today?
17/1/24, 9:07 AM - +260 97 1819712: Good morning Ms Siddhi and the admissions board,
We're okay thank you! How are you?
17/1/24, 9:15 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know if you were able to go through the videos in detail? If yes, could you share your understanding of the same?
17/1/24, 9:15 AM - +260 97 1819712: Alright.
17/1/24, 9:17 AM - +260 97 1819712: On the second video ..
They're is an elaboration of following instructions through  out the process of the Edoofa scholarship program to avoid fraudulent or scams, but the founders having invested 10years in establishing Edoofa, it has collaborated or partnered with a vast of universities in India even across Africa that makes it  an ideal authentic Program to  go for.
Therefore,it hasn't only managed to get deserving students  a place in university but has also made it  possible for students to get employed upon completion of one's career.It has also been mentioned that Edoofa scholarship has made higher education affordable or accessible through it's aspect of EWYL program. More emphasis on following instruction ,it is important that a particular student has the right attitude towards following instructions which amounts to a standard of
protocol and recommendation from universities.
In addition,part of the program is to equip and nurture the students with necessary skill and information relevant in any line of work.
17/1/24, 9:18 AM - +260 97 1819712: The third video


Next is the statement of purpose considered as an opportunity for creating the best first impression.
The Statement of purpose is the only subjective document which gives an opportunity to students to convince the admissions board or any other school why one is worthy of been accepted in that particular institution. It is a platform given to display ones skill,strengths and passed achievements and more importanly it should contain a vision and goal explaining why one is worthy of being accepted in a particular university,purpose of studying that particular course so that he/she is granted the best scholarship rate.
Lastly I've been told there's a link to click on right after finishing watching this video, a form to be filled in diligently with no hesitation.
17/1/24, 9:20 AM - +260 97 1819712: The fourth video

The last step of the Edoofa cycle is the university interaction.Iam being cautioned to do as the admission requires me to do,so I can be prepared for the interaction .
I've also been given an insight on how Edoofa has gotten to partner with over 250 universities out of over 3000 universities and colleges,mostly people want to know more about why Edoofa has managed to produce students with flying colors,the reason is Edoofa has invested over 10 years of hardwork,creating systems,met a lot of  school owners,took survey on how conducive the studying environment is like and how students are experiencing higher education there.
Edoofa has invested much time which has totally paid off in Identifying the right universities and colleges.
Students also get exposed to a different culture such as HoLi.
Edoofa builds the right kind of attitude,skill and knowledge in an Edoofian to make him have high chances of employment.
In a nutshell the 10years of Edoofa's establishment was to invest in Identifying good schools,colleges and universities for passionate edoofians.The founders insist on students to follow instructions as to prepare and be qualified for these prestigious institutions.
17/1/24, 9:25 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Brilliant, you seem to have understood the founders’ message quite well! Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
17/1/24, 9:27 AM - +260 97 1819712: Yes we are Madam. <This message was edited>

18/1/24, 2:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Friday, as previously agreed upon.

To kick start the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:
18/1/24, 2:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: https://chat.whatsapp.com/JZMYms2RRTsDQdU3wAv6yH
18/1/24, 2:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Ramona Chali, and my EWYL group name is Ramona EWYL23E1174. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on Monday to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximise the benefits and start on the right track.*
18/1/24, 2:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is* _________ *and he/she has scheduled my session for* ________ (mention the date) <This message was edited>
18/1/24, 2:07 PM - +260 97 1819712: Duly noted.Thank you madam!.
18/1/24, 2:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counselling on university admission*.
18/1/24, 2:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 11 February 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
18/1/24, 2:15 PM - +260 97 1819712: Thank you for the reminder Madam.
I'm certain that the preparation are firmly fixed,of course there aligned in right direction.
18/1/24, 2:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better, 

In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Cardiovascular Technology) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
18/1/24, 2:20 PM - +260 97 1819712: I confirm,it's accurate
18/1/24, 2:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
18/1/24, 2:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
18/1/24, 2:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
18/1/24, 2:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
18/1/24, 2:30 PM - +260 97 1819712: Absolutely.
18/1/24, 2:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
18/1/24, 2:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalise their registration process.
18/1/24, 2:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee.
18/1/24, 2:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counsellor has also discussed the registration fee during your counselling sessions, correct?
18/1/24, 2:47 PM - +260 97 1819712: Correct.
18/1/24, 3:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
18/1/24, 3:20 PM - +260 97 1819712: Sure,we're on the same page.
18/1/24, 3:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
18/1/24, 3:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
18/1/24, 3:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
18/1/24, 3:23 PM - +260 97 1819712: Noted
18/1/24, 3:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
18/1/24, 3:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two instalments of $1025 each. The initial instalment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly instalments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
18/1/24, 3:30 PM - +260 97 1819712: Understood!
18/1/24, 3:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
18/1/24, 3:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
18/1/24, 3:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
18/1/24, 3:36 PM - +260 97 1819712: Duly noted!
18/1/24, 3:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.
18/1/24, 3:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
18/1/24, 4:09 PM - +260 97 1819712: It's all clear madam,thank you!
18/1/24, 4:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
18/1/24, 4:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
18/1/24, 4:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
18/1/24, 4:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 4:36 PM - +260 97 1819712: I can't wait to be part of the Edoofa family as an approved Edoofian.Thank you for sharing the beautiful picture with me,like you mentioned it's quite motivating and inspiring.
18/1/24, 5:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, indeed Ramona. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.
18/1/24, 5:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
18/1/24, 5:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.
18/1/24, 5:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
18/1/24, 5:05 PM - +260 97 1819712: I'am eagerly to know, please what's the news?
18/1/24, 5:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.
18/1/24, 5:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000. 

We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
18/1/24, 5:12 PM - +260 97 1819712: Yes I'am aware.
18/1/24, 6:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well, dear. In that case, let me help you with more information on it. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
18/1/24, 6:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Suppose that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
18/1/24, 6:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
18/1/24, 6:30 PM - +260 97 1819712: Quite understood,I have no questions to ask,thank you!.
18/1/24, 6:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to know that you were able to follow all the details, dear. Are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
18/1/24, 6:54 PM - +260 97 1819712: I'am super excited for having such a privilege to benefit from the Edoofa programe,I extend my gratitude to every program board member for making it possible and easy to access higher education.
Can't wait for the next step and the offer letter though!.
18/1/24, 7:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, dear. The universities will take three to five days to evaluate your application, after which, if they accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you a scholarship offer letter. In the offer letter, the scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee will be mentioned.
18/1/24, 7:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With this, let us conclude our conversation for today. I will reach out to you once we get an update from the universities. Wish you a blessed night, and please extend our regards to your family as well.
18/1/24, 7:16 PM - +260 97 1819712: Alright,thank you once more,I'll be patiently waiting.
18/1/24, 7:19 PM - +260 97 1819712: Thank you for your service Ms Siddhi and the admissions inclusive ..I appreciate your regards Thank you.
