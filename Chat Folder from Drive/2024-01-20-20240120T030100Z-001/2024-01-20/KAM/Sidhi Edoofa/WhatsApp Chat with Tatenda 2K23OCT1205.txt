27/12/23, 1:02 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Tatenda!

I hope you are doing well and blessed today. It has been a while since the last time we were connected. I was occupied with the holidays. Please, how are you doing today and how was your holiday?
27/12/23, 1:05 PM - +263 77 643 4112: I am doing well . Thank you for reaching out.
27/12/23, 1:05 PM - +263 77 643 4112: My holiday was fine l did have a good experience
27/12/23, 1:12 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session?
27/12/23, 1:12 PM - +263 77 643 4112: Its oky we can proceed
27/12/23, 1:14 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
27/12/23, 1:16 PM - +263 77 643 4112: Yes l do agree
27/12/23, 1:17 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
27/12/23, 1:17 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
27/12/23, 1:21 PM - +263 77 643 4112: Thank you l really understand  and feel  comforted
27/12/23, 1:21 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
27/12/23, 1:22 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
27/12/23, 1:23 PM - +263 77 643 4112: So after getting a deploma you can also be able to continue to bachelors degree with edoofa as well
27/12/23, 1:25 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is absolutely correct.
27/12/23, 1:25 PM - +263 77 643 4112: Oky thank you now l understad
27/12/23, 1:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
27/12/23, 1:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/12/23, 1:29 PM - +263 77 643 4112: I didnt get interms of certificates of various job-oroented projects
27/12/23, 1:31 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the concern with me. These are related to your EWYL projects and your session. For further detail, you can connect with your mentor. May I know if you are clear now?
27/12/23, 1:35 PM - +263 77 643 4112: Yaa am clear now thank you
27/12/23, 1:47 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
27/12/23, 1:52 PM - +263 77 643 4112: Yes l am please leats proceed
27/12/23, 1:53 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for your application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.

13/1/24, 9:40 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
13/1/24, 9:41 AM - +263 77 643 4112: And thank you for being available for me
13/1/24, 9:43 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is your annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
13/1/24, 9:54 AM - +263 77 643 4112: 1.Tuition fee per annum $350
2. Accommodation fee per annum is $0
3.annual fee at MVN university after scholarship $1600
4.sports and Misc fee one time payed $125
5. Admission and processing fee $1000
13/1/24, 10:26 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 90% scholarship on tuition fees. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
13/1/24, 10:29 AM - +263 77 643 4112: Yes it is
13/1/24, 10:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, there is a small correction I would like to make here, dear. The *Sports and Misc. Fee (One-time payable)* are 2 different components, i.e., column H and column I. Hence, the total of both components will be $250. I hope I am clear?
13/1/24, 10:36 AM - +263 77 643 4112: Oky thank you for the correction
13/1/24, 10:37 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to see that. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
13/1/24, 10:38 AM - +263 77 643 4112: Well noted thank you
13/1/24, 10:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1600 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1850.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1600. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
13/1/24, 10:50 AM - +263 77 643 4112: Its so clear thank you
13/1/24, 10:58 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund

17/1/24, 12:31 PM - +263 77 643 4112: Good afternoon Ms Siddhi .

I am ready to do our discussion
17/1/24, 12:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tatenda. How are you all doing today?
17/1/24, 1:01 PM - +263 77 643 4112: I am doing well today
17/1/24, 1:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. May I know if you are ready to continue with our discussion?
17/1/24, 1:19 PM - +263 77 643 4112: Yes l am ready
17/1/24, 1:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1850, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
17/1/24, 1:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
17/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 77 643 4112: Thank you for allowing me to know this and l am doing my EWYL sessions already
17/1/24, 2:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, dear. Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
17/1/24, 2:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $1600. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1600 - $1000 = $600, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.

If you wish to get admission into LPU, then you are definitely on the right path. We have already shared your application with LPU and are waiting for an update from their end. Since the A-Level results have been released recently, they are receiving a lot of applications and it is taking them some time to revert to us with an update. <This message was edited>
