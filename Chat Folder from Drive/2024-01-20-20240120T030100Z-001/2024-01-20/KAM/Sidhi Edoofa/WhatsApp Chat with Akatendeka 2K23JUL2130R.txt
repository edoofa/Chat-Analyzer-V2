16/1/24, 1:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Akatendeka,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 1:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
17/1/24, 12:22 PM - +263 78 100 3606: Good Afternoon
17/1/24, 12:22 PM - +263 78 100 3606: Noted with thanks
17/1/24, 1:08 PM - +263 77 211 2579: Greetings officer-- I'm sure this message can't be for Akatendeka and us. We've long since been linked with Galgotias university, having fulfilled all conditions required to secure a place. We sent the girl's A.Level results and paid the amount which was said to be the 1st semester tuition. Evidence to this is here on this platform. Madam Kirti has been guiding us all along. I wonder now how it seems we've to restart the process.
19/1/24, 7:28 AM - +263 77 211 2579: Greetings Edoofa admissions team-- I'm seeking clarification on the way forward concerning Akatendeka's university education in India. I'm perturbed to learn that you're still expecting the girl's A.Level results which I shared with you twice on this platform. Also, I paid $600.00 to Galgotias university after you had indicated my daughter had been offered a place there. May someone kindly clear the confusion here and explain how it's coming about.
