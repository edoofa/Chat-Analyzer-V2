17/1/24, 9:14 AM - +263 77 353 2574: We are fine ma'am
17/1/24, 9:20 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are all fine. I am doing well myself. Thank you for asking, dear.
17/1/24, 9:21 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is quite alright. In the meanwhile we can proceed with the session if you are ready?
17/1/24, 9:27 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Yes ma'am.
17/1/24, 9:36 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
17/1/24, 9:37 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we begin today's session, I would like to ask whether you were able to fill out all the forms that we discussed yesterday? If yes, could you kindly share images or a scanned version of those forms, please.
17/1/24, 9:41 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Yes ma'am

17/1/24, 9:50 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Allow me to go through the documents once and I will let you know if there are any changes or corrections to be made.
17/1/24, 9:51 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This image is not quite clear. Could you kindly click another picture and send it again, dear?
17/1/24, 9:52 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Yes ma'am
17/1/24, 9:53 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: You will need to fill in the orientation date as well.
17/1/24, 9:54 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Allow me to help you understand it better, dear. The column "orientation availability" refers to a 3-day window following the commencement of your EWYL program, which, in your case, is on January 23. After the initiation, you will have a 3-day period during which you will commence your EWYL orientation, specifically from January 23 to January 26 in your situation. Your EWYL program initiation date remains January 19, and you are required to input a date between January 23 and January 26 for your Orientation program. It is permissible for both the EWYL Program availability and Orientation availability to share the same date. If you are available for the orientation on January 23 itself, kindly indicate so. I hope I am clear?
17/1/24, 9:56 AM - +263 78 289 6783: You're very clear ma'am
17/1/24, 9:56 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Let me go get my passport sized photo taken so that I can send all the documents in full
17/1/24, 9:58 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well, dear. You may submit the same by the end of the session. If you are ready, shall we proceed with our session for now?
17/1/24, 9:59 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Yes ma'am
17/1/24, 10:12 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
17/1/24, 10:15 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Yes ma'am
17/1/24, 10:20 AM - +263 78 289 6783: <Media omitted>
17/1/24, 10:30 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I believe there has been a misunderstanding, dear. I mistakenly wrote the wrong dates for your initialization. Your EWYL commencement date remains the same as 19 January, however your 3-day period ranges from 19 January to 22 January. Could you kindly update the document accordingly?
17/1/24, 10:34 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Okay ma'am
17/1/24, 10:38 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well, dear. Kindly update the document accordingly and share it with me before our session concludes. You need not print the forms again, you may make the changes on the same form itself. I hope I am clear?
17/1/24, 11:03 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Yes ma'am, I am sending now
17/1/24, 11:07 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is quite alright, dear. You may submit the same by the end of our session today. If you are ready, shall we proceed with our session for now?

17/1/24, 11:38 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing these documents with me. Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
17/1/24, 11:39 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Yes we may begin
17/1/24, 11:46 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/1/24, 11:46 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, I would encourage you to go through the above image representing your university admission process and once you are done, let me know so that I can explain the same to you in detail.
17/1/24, 11:48 AM - +263 78 289 6783: I have gone through it ma'am.
17/1/24, 11:53 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
17/1/24, 11:53 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
17/1/24, 11:54 AM - +263 78 289 6783: They are very clear.
17/1/24, 12:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
17/1/24, 12:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counselling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counselling session will take about 1 hour.
17/1/24, 12:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
17/1/24, 12:30 PM - +263 78 289 6783: Yes I am ma'am <This message was edited>
17/1/24, 12:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
17/1/24, 12:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
17/1/24, 12:34 PM - +263 78 289 6783: Yes they are crystal clear ma'am
17/1/24, 12:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
17/1/24, 12:35 PM - +263 78 289 6783: Yes we may start ma'am
17/1/24, 12:36 PM - +263 77 364 2468: Thank you. Yes, the above steps are very clear.
17/1/24, 12:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
17/1/24, 12:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding, and until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually.
17/1/24, 12:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
17/1/24, 12:38 PM - +263 78 289 6783: Yes you can share them now I'm ready
17/1/24, 12:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
17/1/24, 12:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait that distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

17/1/24, 12:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
17/1/24, 12:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

17/1/24, 12:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Emilder, I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarise your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
17/1/24, 12:48 PM - +263 78 289 6783: The videos are downloading, i will have finished them by end of lunch time(2:00pm)
17/1/24, 1:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is quite alright, dear. You may take today's time and suggest a suitable time for tomorrow so that we can schedule our session accordingly and discuss the videos in detail. I hope I am clear?
17/1/24, 1:19 PM - +263 78 289 6783: 9:00am is okay ma'am.
17/1/24, 1:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 9:00 AM for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to go through the videos. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed rest of the day and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
17/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 78 289 6783: Okay ma'am thank you so much for your time today, talk soon!
17/1/24, 1:58 PM - +263 77 353 2574: Thank you ma'am,good day
17/1/24, 2:15 PM - +263 77 364 2468: Thank you very much for the commitment. Good day.
18/1/24, 9:02 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Good morning ma'am
18/1/24, 9:30 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Emilder. Before we start today's session, I would like to check in on you and your family. How are you all doing today?
18/1/24, 9:30 AM - +263 78 289 6783: We are all doing well, how are you today?
18/1/24, 9:43 AM - +263 77 364 2468: Good morning all. Thank you for checking; we are doing very. The weather is very wet this morning. How is the weather that side?
18/1/24, 9:47 AM - +263 77 353 2574: Good morning ma'am
18/1/24, 10:08 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are all well. I am doing fine myself, thank you for asking. The weather over here is a bit cold today.
18/1/24, 10:08 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know if you were able to go through the videos in detail? If yes, could you share your understanding of the same?
18/1/24, 10:11 AM - +263 78 289 6783: The most important thing that I learnt in the videos was that being open minded and listening attentively to instructions are the most important qualities for an Edoofian. That way the process will smooth sail and I will be able to meet all the deadlines without many difficulties.
18/1/24, 10:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well, dear. Could you also share your understanding of the 4 videos individually?
18/1/24, 10:29 AM - +263 78 289 6783: In the first video, I learnt about the Edoofians on the Wall of Fame.
18/1/24, 10:29 AM - +263 78 289 6783: In the second video, I learnt about how Edoofa helps with choosing the right university that will really help with my success.
18/1/24, 10:30 AM - +263 78 289 6783: In the third video, I learnt about the importance of the Statement of Purpose. Even though being an Edoofian helps influence my university application, the Statement of Purpose shows the admission board why I will be the right fit in that particular university and why they should accept me.
18/1/24, 10:32 AM - +263 78 289 6783: In the fourth and final video I learnt about the boy in Ghana that was cheated out of $1000 by a fake agent who tried milking him out of some more money. However Edoofa offers the opportunity to get into the best colleges in India that guarantee success after graduation.
18/1/24, 10:44 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Brilliant, you seem to have understood the founders’ message quite well! Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
18/1/24, 10:44 AM - +263 78 289 6783: We are on the same page ma'am.
18/1/24, 10:48 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 9:00 AM.
18/1/24, 10:50 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Yes ma'am I understand.
18/1/24, 10:52 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

18/1/24, 11:12 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Yes it is ma'am.

At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process.

18/1/24, 11:22 AM - +263 78 289 6783: I am sure by end of business day today(4:00pm), I would have done the appropriate research needed and sent it to you if that is okay.
18/1/24, 11:30 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: You may take today's time to complete the tasks, dear. Kindly confirm a timing for tomorrow so that we can reconnect and move forward with the application process. I hope you are following?

18/1/24, 4:04 PM - +263 78 289 6783: 2. Rights refer to legal, social, or ethical principles of freedom or entitlement about what is allowed of people or owed to people according to some legal system or ethical theory whereas duties are one's moral or legal responsibilities. Rights are the privileges a person enjoys while duties are the responsibilities which citizens are expected to carry out in return for the rights they enjoy. The types of rights include civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights. People have the duties to carry out these rights in order to make their lives and others bearable.  For example, a person has the right to freedom, hence the right to be left alone by others. Others have the duty or responsibility to leave that person alone. Human rights are moral principles for certain standards of human behaviour that are protected in municipal and international law whilst civil rights are guarantees of equal social opportunities and protection under the law regardless of race, religion or colour. Human rights are rights one acquires by being alive whereas civil rights are rights that one obtains by being a legal member of a certain political state. <This message was edited>

19/1/24, 6:45 AM - +263 78 289 6783: 3. A prosecutor is the legal representative responsible for presenting the case in a criminal trial against the defendant whereas an attorney is someone trained and educated in law who acts as a practitioner in a court of law. A prosecutor works as a government agency bringing criminal charges and must prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt while the attorney represents the accused and attempts to maintain the client's innocence. A prosecutor works closely with the police department within their jurisdiction investigating and gathering evidence whilst a lawyer has to hire their own private investigator if there is need for an investigation or witnesses. A prosecutor's role in court is gathering evidence and witnesses to prove to the court that the accused is guilty of a crime. However, an attorney does the exact opposite by gathering evidence and witnesses with the intent to defend the accused and prove their client did not commit the crime.
19/1/24, 6:45 AM - +263 78 289 6783: 4. I am most interested in pursuing Civil law. Civil law offers a high degree of legal certainity. Civil law provides stability and confidence to individuals and businesses when making legal decisions. Civil law provides clear guidelines for legal relationships. It helps to prevent blurring lines between various legal contexts by helping individuals understand their rights and obligations. It is a way for all citizens to pursue equal representation and justice despite it not always being the case. One of my favourite quotes about civil law by one of the earliest civil law practitioners, Roman statesman Cicero "Civil law is the thing that neither influence can affect nor power nor money or corruption." This shows how civil law helps in building a stable society where individuals are able to pursue their ambitions freely. Civilaw is more concerned with making the community a better place by fixing private disputes between its members. Civil law focuses on conflict resolution and encourages cooperation between members of society.
19/1/24, 8:45 AM - +263 78 289 6783: 5. I possess good verbal and communication skills. In my opinion these are the most important skills a successful lawyer needs in order to convey information in a digestible and concise way. I am also a good listener, in order to win a case a lawyer needs to listen to all the facts being presented and getting important details correct. This also ensures a great relationship with my clients. I am a good team player. Winning cases needs to be a team effort hence a successful lawyer needs to productively work alongside colleagues and clients. I am very thorough with my work and I pay great attention to detail. A great eye to even the smallest detail means I will be able to complete my legal research error-free. I am emotionally intelligent. A lot of cases need to be treated sensitively in order to build trust in clients and maintain a good working relationship with them. I am organized and meticulous, I also work well under pressure. A successful lawyer needs to remain focused as the legal profession can be incredibly demanding and fast-paced.
19/1/24, 9:06 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Emilder. How are you all doing today?
19/1/24, 9:07 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the screenshot and your answers, dear. I have taken a note of it.
19/1/24, 9:08 AM - +263 78 289 6783: We are great ma'am, it's just a bit cold this side. How are you doing there?
19/1/24, 9:08 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Okay thank you ma'am.
19/1/24, 9:09 AM - +263 77 353 2574: We are fine ma'am
19/1/24, 9:10 AM - +263 77 364 2468: Good morning all. Thank you for checking. We are all fine. We had rain all night. The roads are badly damaged because the rains are very light.
19/1/24, 9:12 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you all are doing fine. I understand that the rain is causing a lot of inconvenience for you. I hope that the weather conditions over there improve soon. I am doing fine myself, thank you for asking.
19/1/24, 9:13 AM - +263 78 289 6783: We hope so too! That's great news ma'am.
19/1/24, 9:14 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
19/1/24, 9:15 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Okay ma'am.
19/1/24, 9:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 11 February 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
19/1/24, 9:35 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Yes ma'am, we will be able to pay the remaining fee by end of day tomorrow (Saturday 20 January).
19/1/24, 9:35 AM - +263 77 364 2468: Thanks for the reminder. We appreciate your kindness
19/1/24, 9:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.
19/1/24, 9:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
19/1/24, 9:52 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Yes ma'am.
19/1/24, 9:53 AM - +263 78 289 6783: That is correct
19/1/24, 9:56 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
19/1/24, 9:56 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
19/1/24, 9:56 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
19/1/24, 9:56 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
19/1/24, 9:58 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Okay I understand ma'am.
19/1/24, 9:59 AM - +263 78 289 6783: I agree ma'am it's not possible.
19/1/24, 10:04 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
19/1/24, 10:04 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
19/1/24, 10:04 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee.
19/1/24, 10:04 AM - +263 78 289 6783: May I please ask ma'am, if my application gets accepted by multiple universities, will Edoofa help me choose the best one since I am not too familiar with universities in India?
19/1/24, 10:05 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
19/1/24, 10:07 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Yes she did.
19/1/24, 10:07 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Absolutely, dear. We are here to guide and support you wherever you need assistance. When you receive an offer letter, we will discuss the same in detail with you which will help you gain more clarity about the college. When the time comes, we will be here to assist you with the same. I hope this helps?
19/1/24, 10:08 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
19/1/24, 10:09 AM - +263 78 289 6783: It helps thank you ma'am.
19/1/24, 10:11 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Yes ma'am, we are on the same page.
19/1/24, 10:14 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
19/1/24, 10:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*

Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
19/1/24, 10:24 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Yes I understand ma'am.
19/1/24, 10:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
19/1/24, 10:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
19/1/24, 10:30 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Okay ma'am, we understand.
19/1/24, 10:34 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
19/1/24, 10:34 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
19/1/24, 10:34 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
19/1/24, 10:37 AM - +263 78 289 6783: That's a relief, meaning through the credits I'll earn I can bring down the fee (tuition fee+food and accommodation)per semester? <This message was edited>
19/1/24, 10:47 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
19/1/24, 10:48 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Through the EWYL Scholarship Credits, you can effectively reduce your annual tuition fees. If you manage to cover the entire tuition fee with these credits, our team can assist you in redirecting the remaining scholarship credits to help bring down your food and accommodation expenses. I hope this was helpful?
19/1/24, 10:49 AM - +263 78 289 6783: It was very helpful ma'am thank you, I understand.
19/1/24, 11:00 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad, dear. Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.
19/1/24, 11:00 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/1/24, 11:05 AM - +263 78 289 6783: I have no queries yet ma'am.
19/1/24, 11:20 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
19/1/24, 11:20 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
19/1/24, 11:20 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
19/1/24, 11:21 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 11:21 AM - +263 78 289 6783: We are very excited.
19/1/24, 11:22 AM - +263 78 289 6783: It's an honour to have this opportunity!
19/1/24, 11:25 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Definitely ma'am!
19/1/24, 11:29 AM - +263 77 364 2468: We thank you for taking our daughter through the process. All the steps have been shared, and we now understand the requirements. As you take her further to the finals, we are also busy putting funds together so that we don't let her down at the end of the steps towards departure.
19/1/24, 11:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are welcome, Mr. Makura. I am glad to hear that you are all preparing well for Emilder's higher education journey. It is because of supportive and wonderful parents like you that your child is able to achieve her dream of pursuing quality higher education and build a successful career.
19/1/24, 11:40 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
19/1/24, 11:40 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
19/1/24, 11:43 AM - +263 78 289 6783: We are more than excited to know!
19/1/24, 11:49 AM - +263 77 364 2468: 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🙏🏼" Yes, Siddhi, l am ready. My hands are up in the air, ready to receive the good news
19/1/24, 11:52 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.
19/1/24, 11:52 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000. 

We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
19/1/24, 11:58 AM - +263 78 289 6783: No, we are not aware of the solution.
19/1/24, 11:59 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Thank you for understanding the difficult economic situation we Africans are experiencing.
19/1/24, 12:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
19/1/24, 12:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university [For most of the universities 15 days]. Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
19/1/24, 12:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
19/1/24, 12:29 PM - +263 78 289 6783: That sounds amazing ma'am!
19/1/24, 12:29 PM - +263 78 289 6783: No ma'am everything is very clear.
19/1/24, 12:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/1/24, 12:56 PM - +263 78 289 6783: No I do not have any ma'am. <This message was edited>
19/1/24, 3:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that, Emilder. I apologize for the delay in my response as I had to attend an urgent work-related meeting. I hope you are still available to continue with our discussion dear?
