19/1/24, 3:53 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: Yes I am
19/1/24, 3:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that your day is going well. My day has been very eventful as well.
19/1/24, 3:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
19/1/24, 4:01 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: I am ready
19/1/24, 4:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
19/1/24, 4:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
19/1/24, 4:11 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: Can you please further explain the second stage
19/1/24, 4:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a very vital document for your application, as it serves as a personalized and comprehensive document that highlights your motivations, qualifications, and goals, providing admissions committees with valuable insights into your application. Since it is a subjective document, your inputs are quite important. After taking your detailed inputs, the Edoofa team will provide assistance in improving or improvising your SOP and then include the same in your application profile. As we proceed with our sessions, you will gain more clarity on the same. I hope this was helpful?
19/1/24, 4:18 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: Yes it was
19/1/24, 6:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad that it was helpful for you and cleared your query. I apologize for not being able to continue with our discussion today as it was a hectic day with many urgent meetings lined up. My operational hours for the day have concluded and I have had a long day already. Hence, I would love to reconnect with you tomorrow at 10:00 AM to continue with our discussion regarding your admission journey. If the timing is not suitable for you, kindly suggest a more suitable time frame and I will connect with you at that hour. I will be looking forward to it, dear. Until then, please take care and have a blessed night!
19/1/24, 6:54 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: At 12:00PM,if its fine with you
