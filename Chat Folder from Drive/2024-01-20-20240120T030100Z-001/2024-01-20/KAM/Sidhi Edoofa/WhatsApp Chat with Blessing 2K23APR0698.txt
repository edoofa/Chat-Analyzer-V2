The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.

Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?

5/1/24, 6:46 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Yes I'm ready
5/1/24, 7:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
5/1/24, 7:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
5/1/24, 7:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
5/1/24, 7:09 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Noted
5/1/24, 7:09 PM - +263 71 438 0324: I'm done
5/1/24, 7:16 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
5/1/24, 7:16 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
5/1/24, 7:16 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
5/1/24, 7:28 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Following
5/1/24, 8:18 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
5/1/24, 8:18 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
5/1/24, 8:18 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
5/1/24, 10:08 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Yes
5/1/24, 10:09 PM - +263 71 438 0324: My apologies I was not online for the past hours due to network challenges
6/1/24, 1:33 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Parents of Blessing,

I firmly believe that with the commencement of this new year, comes the promise of fresh beginnings, guiding the way for the actualization of one's deepest dreams and aspirations. As we stand on the threshold of this promising year, I am filled with excitement for the adventures it holds.
6/1/24, 1:33 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the same spirit, I would like to share that I am embarking on a journey as I prepare myself to pursue my doctorate and take a step forward in my academic pursuits. This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.
6/1/24, 1:33 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The decision to transition to a new phase in my life presents an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of students, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience remain enriched and fulfilling.

As I embark on this new journey, I want to assure you that I have entrusted your application file to capable hands. From this point forward, your admission journey will be seamlessly guided by one of our accomplished admission officers, *Ms. Siddhi,* who will connect with you on Tuesday.  I hope you will make yourself available for further procedures and will give your best to your career.
6/1/24, 1:33 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments. Wish you all the best, and God Bless.

Regards,
Mr. Shiveet
Edoofa Admission Team.
6/1/24, 1:33 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Thank you
6/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Thank you so much,it was great working with you and all the best in your doctorate
8/1/24, 2:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Blessing,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honoured to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
8/1/24, 2:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
8/1/24, 2:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 2:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
8/1/24, 2:11 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Greetings Ms Siddhi
8/1/24, 2:11 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Thank you so much for your willingness to assist me in achieving my goals
8/1/24, 2:11 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Awesome! that's a great achievement
8/1/24, 3:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
8/1/24, 3:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It truly is, Blessing.

Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practice more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?
8/1/24, 3:28 PM - +263 71 438 0324: I have decided to spend more time with my family and friends learn a lot of skills from the people around me, commence my bachelor's,meet new friends and learn other cultures moreso helping other students get into Edoofa scholarship program
8/1/24, 3:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is so great, Blessing! Absolutely, with learning comes transformative changes that offer the opportunity for personal growth and success, I am looking forward for you to explore all the adventures that lie ahead of you.
8/1/24, 3:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, I would like to shift focus to your admission process. As per your application file, it seems that you were unable to proceed with your admission formalities scheduled for August 2024. Since a few months have passed, and this is our first interaction, I would like to inquire why you were unable to do so and if now is the right time for you to focus on your university admission journey for higher education abroad.
8/1/24, 3:40 PM - +263 71 438 0324: I was at school and we weren't allowed phones there,yes now it's the right time for me to focus on my university admission journey
8/1/24, 4:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is completely understandable, dear. Schools implement such policies for the benefit of the students, allowing them to concentrate and perform at their best during examinations.

It is great to know that you are now available to take your admission process forward.

I would like to schedule a detailed conversation regarding the same for tomorrow. Would you be available at 9:00 AM tomorrow? <This message was edited>
8/1/24, 4:52 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Yes I will
8/1/24, 5:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright Blessing. I will connect with you tomorrow. Till then, take care and have a good night!
9/1/24, 9:16 AM - +263 71 438 0324: Good morning
9/1/24, 9:27 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good morning, Blessing. I hope you are having a lovely day. How are you today?
9/1/24, 9:28 AM - +263 71 438 0324: I'm ok ,how are you?
9/1/24, 9:44 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you for asking, dear.

As per my records, Mr. Shivjeet was in the process of explaining the benefits of the *Endowment Program 2024*, am I correct?
9/1/24, 9:44 AM - +263 71 438 0324: Yes you are correct
9/1/24, 9:48 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education, and any queries regarding the plans explained by Mr. Shivjeet up until now?
9/1/24, 9:56 AM - +263 71 438 0324: No I don't have any queries
9/1/24, 10:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. May I know if you are ready to move ahead with our discussion?
9/1/24, 10:17 AM - +263 71 438 0324: Yess I'm ready
9/1/24, 10:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright, dear. Continuing the previous conversation, let us move ahead.
9/1/24, 10:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
9/1/24, 10:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
9/1/24, 10:47 AM - +263 71 438 0324: Yes
9/1/24, 11:06 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
9/1/24, 11:06 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
9/1/24, 11:07 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $450 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
9/1/24, 11:10 AM - +263 71 438 0324: What if I fail to pay the first $450 on the date given by the university
9/1/24, 11:12 AM - +263 71 438 0324: And since I preferred taking the august intake is there a chance whereby the registration fee will be required as early as January or February?
9/1/24, 11:23 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
9/1/24, 11:23 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
9/1/24, 11:23 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.

9/1/24, 11:29 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
9/1/24, 11:30 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In order to secure the scholarship seat, you will be required to pay the registration amount within 2 weeks of receiving your offer letter, as the number of scholarship seats is limited.  Currently, 69 students have already secured their seats, leaving 31 positions available for this month.
9/1/24, 11:31 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly elaborate any other queries that you have.
9/1/24, 11:35 AM - +263 71 438 0324: Does this mean I might receive the offer letter sometime this month and I will be required to pay the registration fee this month and the other next month
9/1/24, 12:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is correct that once your application process is complete and you have received an offer letter, you will be required to pay the registration amount within 2 weeks of receiving the offer letter as per the university. However, with the help of *Endowment Program 2024*, you will have the option of paying 50% of the amount before the deadline given by the university, and the other 50% can be paid within the next 30 days of the initial deadline set by the university.
9/1/24, 12:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I hope that clears your query?
9/1/24, 1:28 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Yes thank you
9/1/24, 1:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright, you are welcome. <This message was edited>
9/1/24, 1:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
9/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 71 438 0324: May u please provide me with more information about it
9/1/24, 2:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Surely, Blessing. Which aspect do you want me to explain?
9/1/24, 2:27 PM - +263 71 438 0324: How my scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter I'm to secure considering I don't have my Alevel results
9/1/24, 2:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
9/1/24, 2:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
9/1/24, 2:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
9/1/24, 2:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
9/1/24, 2:58 PM - +263 71 438 0324: I now get it
9/1/24, 2:59 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Thank you for explaining
9/1/24, 3:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is my pleasure, dear. Are you ready to move forward with the admission process?
9/1/24, 3:07 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Yes I'm ready
9/1/24, 3:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I believe Mr. Shivjeet introduced you to the first two benefits of the Endowment Program. Would you like me to provide a brief overview of the same, or would you prefer to proceed with the next benefits?
9/1/24, 3:32 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Let's proceed to the benefits

9/1/24, 4:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

9/1/24, 4:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $450 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
9/1/24, 5:06 PM - +263 71 438 0324: No
9/1/24, 5:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
9/1/24, 5:16 PM - +263 71 438 0324: I'm familiar with it that's what we talked about recently
9/1/24, 5:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright dear, now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
9/1/24, 5:19 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Yes
9/1/24, 5:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
9/1/24, 5:29 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Yes I do agree
9/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
9/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
9/1/24, 5:36 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Yes I'm clear
9/1/24, 5:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
9/1/24, 5:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
9/1/24, 5:53 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Yes
9/1/24, 6:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.

11/1/24, 1:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
11/1/24, 1:31 PM - +263 71 438 0324: No I don't have any queries
11/1/24, 1:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well, dear. Are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 69 students have already secured their seats, leaving 31 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
11/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Yes I'm excited
11/1/24, 1:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, dear. With this, we can proceed to step 4 of the admission cycle, i.e., Offer Letter from University/College. The universities will take three to five days to evaluate your application, after which, if they accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you a scholarship offer letter. In the offer letter, the scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee will be mentioned.

With this, let us conclude our conversation for today. I will reach out to you once we get an update from the universities. Wish you a blessed day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family as well.
11/1/24, 2:01 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Thank you 😊
16/1/24, 6:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Blessing,

17/1/24, 12:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Blessing. I have added Blessing's father's number to the group.

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
17/1/24, 12:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
17/1/24, 12:57 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Thank you for adding him
17/1/24, 1:00 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Yes we had the chance to go through the later thoroughly
17/1/24, 1:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
17/1/24, 1:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
17/1/24, 1:05 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Yes it works,lm looking forward to the discussion <This message was edited>
17/1/24, 1:14 PM - +263 77 994 9728: Thank you for adding me into the group
17/1/24, 1:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are welcome, sir.
17/1/24, 1:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
17/1/24, 1:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
17/1/24, 1:36 PM - +263 71 438 0324: 1)$900
2)4 years ( 8 semesters)
3) $300 
4)$759
17/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 77 994 9728: Yes I went through the letter.  I noticed that  my child was given a scholarship of 50% of the Tution fee which was $1800 per semester . This will become  $900 per semester before credits deduction.  The acceptance letter we received sometime seem to be highlighting that my daughter will get a scholarship that will cover part of  Tution fee , accommodation, food as well as other expenses now it seems to be no longer the case.  Another  thing I noted is that the Accommodation fee and food fee of $2250 can not be paid in instalments but in full for the whole year. Indeed it will be so challenging to us to raise such an amount at once and make the payment due sudden changes that took place   to our disposable income. I really want my child to be part of  Edoofa .
17/1/24, 2:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
17/1/24, 2:15 PM - +263 77 994 9728: Registration fee required is $750 on question 4
17/1/24, 2:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand where you are coming from, sir. I believe there has been a misunderstanding. If you refer to the acceptance letter from Edoofa, we have mentioned that the 50-100% scholarship will be offered on tuition fees, and as you can see in your Offer Letter from Galgotias University, your child has received a 50% scholarship on the tuition fees. However, since it is difficult to project the overall annual cost of education, Edoofa takes an extra step to help you give an idea about the overall annual cost of education including tuition fees, accommodation, food. As suggested by us, your overall annual cost of education will range from $2000 - $3000. Be rest assured, that the same will be the case. Allow me to help you understand the letter in a better manner so that you can get more clarity on the matter. I hope this was helpful?
17/1/24, 2:23 PM - +263 77 994 9728: Thank you for being there  to guide us to understand . Your help is greatly appreciated
17/1/24, 2:26 PM - +263 77 994 9728: Noted with thanks
17/1/24, 2:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome sir.
17/1/24, 2:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a 4-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 8 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
17/1/24, 2:36 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Yes it clarifies
17/1/24, 2:42 PM - +263 77 994 9728: Yes
17/1/24, 2:47 PM - +263 77 599 2273: Yes
17/1/24, 2:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
17/1/24, 2:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
17/1/24, 2:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.

17/1/24, 3:01 PM - +263 77 599 2273: Following
17/1/24, 3:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
17/1/24, 3:32 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Following
17/1/24, 3:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
17/1/24, 3:38 PM - +263 77 994 9728: Following
17/1/24, 3:38 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Following
17/1/24, 3:38 PM - +263 77 599 2273: Very clear
17/1/24, 3:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
17/1/24, 3:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on January 30 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
17/1/24, 3:51 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Wow that's awesome
17/1/24, 3:53 PM - +263 71 438 0324: So this 750 is it a once off payment before 30 January <This message was edited>
17/1/24, 3:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: According to the university guidelines, yes. However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
17/1/24, 3:59 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Yes may you kindly explain
17/1/24, 4:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $650  of the registration fee. This $650 can be conveniently paid in two instalments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$325 before the first deadline date of January 30th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$325  before the second deadline date of February 29th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
17/1/24, 4:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $650 within 15 working days, before *January 30th, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
17/1/24, 4:05 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Yes we are in agreement
17/1/24, 4:06 PM - +263 77 599 2273: Thank you for shading light on this it's now very clear and as a parent i am grateful with this
17/1/24, 4:06 PM - +263 77 599 2273: Thank you
17/1/24, 4:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome, ma'am.
17/1/24, 4:07 PM - +263 77 994 9728: Noted with thanks
17/1/24, 4:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
17/1/24, 4:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
17/1/24, 4:14 PM - +263 77 599 2273: We resides in Marondera town it's near Harare
17/1/24, 4:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, if you are planning to make the payment from Harare through someone else or by travelling there yourself, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
17/1/24, 4:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
17/1/24, 4:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
17/1/24, 4:22 PM - +263 77 599 2273: Noted with thanks
17/1/24, 4:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.
17/1/24, 4:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
17/1/24, 4:26 PM - +263 77 599 2273: I will travel to Harare for payment
17/1/24, 4:27 PM - +263 77 599 2273: Noted
17/1/24, 4:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
17/1/24, 4:32 PM - +263 77 599 2273: Yes you can provide the account details
17/1/24, 4:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference - 

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
17/1/24, 4:41 PM - +263 77 599 2273: Thank you
17/1/24, 4:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right Blessing, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
17/1/24, 4:51 PM - +263 77 599 2273: Noted with thanks
17/1/24, 4:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
17/1/24, 4:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
17/1/24, 4:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
17/1/24, 4:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?

17/1/24, 5:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
17/1/24, 5:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
17/1/24, 5:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
17/1/24, 5:11 PM - +263 77 599 2273: Yes it's really advantageous
17/1/24, 5:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
