16/1/24, 9:25 AM - +263 71 250 1277: Thank you Ms. Siddhi Singh. In about a month's worth of time, my highest qualification will be Ordinary levels, I have already sat for them in the November 2023 session of the ZIMSEC examination council and I'm waiting for the publication of the results. For me, getting the opportunity to pursue a Diploma in Business Administration is about more than just earning a qualification. It's about gaining the skills and knowledge that will allow me to succeed in an industry that is constantly changing and evolving. I am drawn to the challenge of working in a fast-paced and dynamic environment, and I am excited by the opportunities that this field offers. I also believe that business and finance have the potential to make a positive impact on the world, and I am eager to play a role in that.

My father is a security manager at Zialandia Mine in Midlands Zimbabwe and my mother is an Event Planner. My parents highest educational level is Ordinary levels. My parents have been supporting my education so far. I'm hoping the scholarship would be able to support my finances if I get the opportunity to study abroad. I have 3 siblings, the oldest William is a confectioner at Spar supermarket in Cape Town South Africa, my sister, Mercy is an Office Manager working in her capacity as a secretary at a private boarding school in Chivhu called Livingproof High School and lastly, my brother, Praise who is also currently waiting for his final semester results for his BSc. Hons. in Applied Mathematics from the national university of science and technology. I have been studying at Zvishavane High School in Midlands province.

Since this is your admissions group, I believe you must have added your parents to the group. This will help them become familiar with the admission process and enable them to participate when required. Could you please confirm if they have already been added to the group?
16/1/24, 10:05 AM - +263 77 635 0616: Yes I'm Junior's mother . I have been added to the group
16/1/24, 10:10 AM - +263 71 250 1277: Yes I did add them both. My dad might get a bit busy time to time but he too is part of the proceedings. My sister is also in here.

16/1/24, 10:38 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Fantastic! Now over the next four days, our focus as your admission team will be on equipping you with a comprehensive understanding of what lies ahead in your university admission journey and help you commence the same.
16/1/24, 10:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Soon after, we will guide you through the initiation of your EWYL Journey. The next batch of EWYL Sessions is scheduled to commence on Friday (19th January) and hence, if we are able to focus and complete the Admission Process before Thursday (18 January) with pure consistency, you will be able to start your EWYL journey as well in a timely manner.
16/1/24, 10:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly mark this date on your calendar and ensure that you are available to complete the necessary procedures within the stipulated timeline. If everything is proceeding as planned so far, shall we move forward and begin our session for the day?

16/1/24, 10:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
16/1/24, 10:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Junior 2K24JAN0869)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
16/1/24, 10:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Junior EWYL23E1164)* . In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
16/1/24, 10:43 AM - +263 71 250 1277: I completely understand
16/1/24, 10:47 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counsellor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counselling session with your counsellor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
16/1/24, 10:54 AM - +263 71 250 1277: I've really enjoyed the personalized counselling sessions. It's been helpful to have someone to talk to about my goals and challenges. The Edoofa Scholarship Program has also been really beneficial. It's a great way to build skills and a resume, and it can help offset the cost of tuition. The scholarship itself is also a huge help. It covers a significant portion of tuition, which can be a big financial burden for students. It's been really helpful to have that financial support, and it's allowed me to focus on my studies without having to worry about the cost. It's great to have the support of a community of like-minded people who are all working towards similar goals. I really appreciate the resources and opportunities that have been made available through the program. Overall, I feel like I'm growing and learning a lot as a result of the program.
16/1/24, 12:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you found the counselling session to be so helpful and that you were impressed by our program. It is a pleasure to know that you feel like you are growing and learning with us.
16/1/24, 12:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moving forward with the procedures, I would like to share an insight with you. To ensure a seamless experience, we, as a team, have prepared essential documents that not only value your feedback but also outline the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program and the application process. You will have to review, complete, and submit these documents as instructed. 

If you are ready, shall I share a brief overview of these documents for your ease?
16/1/24, 12:28 PM - +263 71 250 1277: Yes ma'am
16/1/24, 12:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Perfect! Let's delve into the documents that are crucial for your journey with Edoofa.

16/1/24, 2:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well, dear. You may submit the forms by tomorrow before our session commences.
16/1/24, 2:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, moving on to the third and final form:

*3. EWYL Program Instructions and Pledge Document:* In the form, you will find a section where you are required to specify the date on which you intend to commence your EWYL journey.

With this form that has been shared with you, I have shared all the forms you have to submit to begin your procedures, please let me know once you have taken note of them so that we can move forward.
16/1/24, 2:25 PM - +263 71 250 1277: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 2:26 PM - +263 71 250 1277: I have taken note. I have submitted the feedback form.
16/1/24, 2:28 PM - +263 71 250 1277: This message was deleted
16/1/24, 2:34 PM - +263 71 250 1277: The immediate date after the 19th is a Saturday. I was willing to commence the orientation then but I wanted to confirm with you if weekends are working days for you.
16/1/24, 2:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For the EWYL program, you may contact your designated EWYL mentor and inform them of the same once you have joined the group. They will definitely schedule your sessions according to your availability. I hope that is clear to you?
16/1/24, 2:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know if you were able to go through the above message, so that we can proceed with our session today?
16/1/24, 2:42 PM - +263 71 250 1277: Yes I have
16/1/24, 2:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Along with these forms, I have asked you to share your academic documents with us. I am currently waiting for that as well.

Moving forward, as a part of your application file, you will need to visit your school and secure a letter of recommendation from them. We have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process.
16/1/24, 2:44 PM - +263 71 250 1277: Yes ma'am
16/1/24, 2:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 2:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, your subject combination for A Level exams, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
16/1/24, 2:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to inquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?
16/1/24, 2:46 PM - +263 71 250 1277: I would have to visit my school tomorrow during working hours, after which I'll compile the document for submission.
16/1/24, 2:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that and I am looking forward to getting an update from your end. I would also like to reiterate that our operational hours are from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM, Central African Time.
16/1/24, 2:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Considering this, for our future sessions, you have to decide on an hour’s time that suits your availability within this timeframe and share the same with us so that we can tailor our subsequent sessions to accommodate your schedule effectively.
16/1/24, 2:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For the next couple of days, we will have sessions on a daily basis and once we cover the first three steps of the admission cycle, we will have sessions scheduled on a need basis. Hence, can you let me know at what time you would like us to schedule our sessions on a daily basis (from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM)?
16/1/24, 3:07 PM - +263 71 250 1277: For an hour's time, all of us would be free from 13:00hrs to 14:00hrs CAT
16/1/24, 3:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, in such a case, we will schedule tomorrow’s session at this time. It's important to note that all three forms and your academic documents with the Letter of recommendation should be completed and submitted by tomorrow before our session. 

This timeline is essential to ensure a smooth progression in the admission process and to meet the goal of concluding this session before Thursday, enabling us to assist you in initiating your EWYL process on time. I hope we are together with this?
16/1/24, 3:16 PM - +263 71 250 1277: We are together, thank you ma'am.
16/1/24, 3:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 1:00 PM for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to fill out all the forms and share the documents. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed night and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
16/1/24, 3:36 PM - +263 71 250 1277: I will ma'am. Thank you. Kind regards.
16/1/24, 3:38 PM - +263 71 250 1277: I'm not sure who my designed EWYL mentor is.
16/1/24, 3:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Your EWYL program is scheduled to begin on 19 January. Be rest assured, that you will be added to the group and will be introduced to your EWYL mentor by then. Does that clear your query?
16/1/24, 3:40 PM - +263 71 250 1277: It does but since I'm supposed to submit my EWYL Program Instructions and Pledge Document before tomorrow I still don't know who I'm supposed to ask about the orientation date since you'd suggested I ask the mentor <This message was edited>
16/1/24, 3:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Since your EWYL program is scheduled to begin on 19 January, after the initiation, you will have a 3-day period i.e., from 19-22 January and you can choose one day that fits your schedule appropriately in order to commence the program. Does this clear your query?
16/1/24, 3:54 PM - +263 71 250 1277: Yes it does. Thank you very much
16/1/24, 4:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well, dear. I will reconnect with you tomorrow for our session. Until then, take care and have a blessed rest of the day!

17/1/24, 11:20 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, I would encourage you to go through the above image representing your university admission process and once you are done, let me know so that I can explain the same to you in detail.
17/1/24, 11:23 AM - +263 71 250 1277: I have gone through it
17/1/24, 11:29 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
17/1/24, 11:29 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
17/1/24, 11:36 AM - +263 71 250 1277: Yes they are
17/1/24, 11:44 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counselling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counselling session will take about 1 hour.
17/1/24, 11:44 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
17/1/24, 12:44 PM - +263 71 250 1277: Yes I am
17/1/24, 1:02 PM - +263 71 250 1277: <Media omitted>
17/1/24, 1:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well, dear. Thank you for sharing the same. May I know when you will be able to share the other documents that I asked you to share previously?
17/1/24, 1:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. A-Level Results/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).
2. O-Level Results.
3. Identity proof (International Travelling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate).
17/1/24, 1:52 PM - +263 71 250 1277: - I'm awaiting O Level results, so I got the letter of recommendation.
- I'm still at my school where I'd gone to procure the letter of recommendation but I'll submit my national ID and birth certificate when I get back home before end of day
17/1/24, 2:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In such a case, I will need you to add one more aspect to the recommendation letter. Since you do not possess your O-Level results yet, you will need to include your subject combination in the letter of recommendation. I hope you are following, dear?
17/1/24, 2:45 PM - +263 71 250 1277: Yes I am
17/1/24, 2:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well, dear. In that case, when will you be able to resubmit the document?
17/1/24, 2:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the meanwhile, we can proceed with our session for the day.
17/1/24, 3:06 PM - +263 71 250 1277: Yes I will. I will have the school help me adjust the document
17/1/24, 3:06 PM - +263 71 250 1277: Yes ma'am
17/1/24, 3:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
17/1/24, 3:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
17/1/24, 3:46 PM - +263 71 250 1277: They are clear
17/1/24, 4:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
17/1/24, 4:25 PM - +263 71 250 1277: Yes ma'am
17/1/24, 4:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
17/1/24, 4:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding, and until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually.
17/1/24, 4:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
17/1/24, 4:32 PM - +263 71 250 1277: Yes I am ready
17/1/24, 4:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
17/1/24, 4:58 PM - +263 71 250 1277: By our session tomorrow I'd have watched the videos
17/1/24, 5:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 9:00 AM for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to go through the videos. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed rest of the day and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
17/1/24, 5:08 PM - +263 71 250 1277: Thank you ma'am. I will be looking forward to our next session.
17/1/24, 5:09 PM - +263 71 250 1277: <Media omitted>
17/1/24, 5:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well, dear. Thank you for sharing it. I have taken a note of it.
17/1/24, 5:17 PM - +263 71 250 1277: Thank you
18/1/24, 9:30 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Junior. Before we start today's session, I would like to check in on you and your family. How are you all doing today?
18/1/24, 9:31 AM - +263 77 635 0616: I'm fine thnx for checking on us
18/1/24, 9:44 AM - +263 77 700 8692: Am good
18/1/24, 10:07 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that. May I know if you were able to go through the videos in detail? If yes, could you share your understanding of the same?
18/1/24, 10:35 AM - +263 71 250 1277: I have gone through them, let me try and explain
18/1/24, 10:44 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well, dear. Kindly share your understanding of each video individually.
18/1/24, 10:50 AM - +263 71 250 1277: Thank you Ms. Singh. For the video titled "Important Message for Enrolled Students." In this video, the founders of Edoofa discuss what they believe are two important qualities of successful students on the Edoofa platform. They emphasize on how instructions are given for a reason, and following them will help you have the best possible experience. They give the example of Steve Jobs as someone who was open-minded and willing to try new things. He never stopped learning and experimenting, and this led to some of his greatest successes. These qualities, similar to grit and growth mindset, define a passion and perseverance for long-term goals, and growth mindset as the belief that one's talents and abilities can be developed over time.
18/1/24, 11:04 AM - +263 71 250 1277: The next video talks about how my personal documents, the assessments that have been made and a statement of purpose will be submitted to all the tertiary institutions on the Edoofa platform. A statement of purpose is described as a document that should be submitted to the tertiary institution as part of the application. The SOP is an opportunity for the applicant to describe their goals, interests, and experiences in their own words. It should be well-written and concise, and should highlight the applicant's unique qualities and qualifications. The SOP should be tailored to the specific program for which the applicant is applying. It should be engaging and informative, and should demonstrate the applicant's commitment to their chosen field of study. The co-founders also talk about being resourceful and avoiding delays when the Admission Team give me a link to a form I should fill out. They say doing it quickly shows that the applicant is committed to pursuing their education and is organized and efficient. They say it exhibits resourcefulness as a key skill for students, that can help them find the information and resources they need to succeed. <This message was edited>
18/1/24, 11:25 AM - +263 71 250 1277: For the video tilted "EDOOFA's vision for you", the co-founders speak on Edoofa's 10 years of experience that gives them a unique advantage over other organizations in the field. With this experience, Edoofa has developed a strong network of contacts and a deep understanding of the application process. This allows them to provide personalized guidance and support to their students, and to help them navigate the complex world of university applications. Edoofa's experience also allows them to offer a wide range of scholarships, making them a valuable resource for students from all backgrounds. They talk about  two major problems facing tertiary students today, which are employability and the cost of education. Regarding employability, many students struggle to find jobs after graduation, and they often lack the skills and experience needed to succeed in the workplace. The second problem is the high cost of education, which can be a barrier to entry for many students. These issues have a significant impact on students' lives but the learn while you earn program offered by Edoofa provides students with a number of valuable skills. These include:
- Time management: Learning to balance work and studies helps students develop the skills needed to succeed in the workplace.
- Self-discipline: Completing work and studies on a schedule helps students develop self-discipline and self-motivation.
- Financial literacy: Earning and managing money while studying can help students learn to budget and manage their finances effectively.
- Professional skills: Working alongside studies can give students valuable experience in the workplace and help them develop skills such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving skills. Edoofa's reputation and relationships with tertiary institutions offer a number of advantages to students. These include:
- Access to a wider range of scholarships and opportunities. Edoofa's connections allow them to offer more options and resources to their students.
- Streamlined application process. Having a trusted intermediary who knows the application process can make the process smoother and less stressful for students.
- Personalized guidance. Edoofa's staff (like my counselor and admission team) have the knowledge and experience to help students choose the right course and institution for their needs.
- Career support. The relationships built with institutions can lead to job opportunities for students after graduation. Lastly they talk about how the actual grand vision they have for the students is "enhancing students' capacity for success" by providing individuals with the skills, knowledge, and resources needed to reach their full potential and achieve their goals. They are achieving this  through various methods, such as training (providing individuals with specific training in areas such as communication, teamwork, or problem-solving.), mentoring (connecting individuals with a mentor who can offer guidance and support), networking (helping individuals build a network of contacts who can provide support and opportunities) and lastly access to resources (providing individuals with access to resources such as books, software, equipment etc etc)
18/1/24, 11:57 AM - +263 71 250 1277: The last eleven minute video talks of how Edoofa chooses the top 250 schools in India for their applicants for several reasons. These include, quality of education (these schools have a reputation for providing high-quality education, and they are often ranked highly in national and international rankings), employability (graduates from these schools often have higher rates of employment, as well as higher starting salaries) and an alumni network (graduates from these schools are often part of a strong and supportive alumni network, which can provide career opportunities and networking opportunities.). The co-founders said they met with the owners of Indian tertiary institutions which provided the Edoofa platform with several advantages. These include:
- An understanding of the institution's mission and values (this allows Edoofa to see if their standards align their services with the institution's goals.)
- Insight into the institution's culture (this can help Edoofa ensure their institution is a good fit for their applicants.)
- Access to key decision-makers (this allows Edoofa to build relationships and advocate for their students' needs....like the example they gave of a half painted school). When choosing the top 250 schools for their applicants, Edoofa took into account the quality of student life at each institution. This is because a high-quality student life can positively impact a student's success in several ways like having a social support as a positive and supportive social environment can help students feel more connected and supported in their studies and community engagement as getting involved in the school community can help students feel a sense of belonging and purpose. The language used in lecturing was also a limiting factor in choosing the top 250 schools for Edoofa's applicants, since, If the language used in lectures is difficult to understand, students may not be able to fully comprehend the material and If students are not comfortable with the language being used, they may be less likely to ask questions or participate in class discussions. Global accreditation and registration was an important factor for Edoofa when choosing the top 250 schools for their applicants. This is because accreditation and registration from reputable bodies can provide assurance of quality and credibility. In India, some of the bodies that offer accreditation and registration for tertiary institutions include, The University Grants Commission, The All India Council for Technical Education, The National Assessment and Accreditation Council and The National Board of Accreditation. When it comes to accommodation and teacher experience, Edoofa looked for schools that provided high-quality accommodation and had experienced and qualified teachers. Accommodation is an important factor because it can have a significant impact on a student's quality of life. For instance, safe and comfortable accommodation can help students feel more at home and less stressed, which can positively impact their academic performance. Experienced and qualified teachers are also important, as they can provide students with the best possible learning experience. The co-founders also spoke of a vibrant culture as being definitely an important factor for Edoofa when it chose the top 250 schools for their applicants. In the case of India, a holiday like Holi provides a great example of this. They said Holi is a festival that celebrates the love in it's different forms and it is celebrated with vibrant colors. For Edoofa, this kind of cultural experience is valuable because it allows students to immerse themselves in a different culture and broaden their horizons (as with the example they gave). When it comes to the requirements of employers, Edoofa looked for schools that offered programs that equip graduates with the skills and attributes that are most in demand by employers. 
Lastly they promised on having interactive platforms with tertiary institutions as it can be a huge advantage for Edoofa and its applicants. These platforms allow for direct communication between the institution and the student, which can provide a wealth of benefits. For example, students can get personalized advice and support from the institution, and they can access additional resources and information that can help them succeed. Additionally, these platforms can help create a sense of community and connection between the institution and its students.
18/1/24, 12:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Brilliant, you seem to have understood the founders’ message quite well! Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
18/1/24, 12:13 PM - +263 71 250 1277: Yes ma'am we are

Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us tomorrow? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
18/1/24, 1:23 PM - +263 71 250 1277: Access to the Zimbabwe Schools Examination results is something I am incapable of giving a clear timeline for. It is up to the national council as to when they release the results
18/1/24, 2:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand, dear. Since you previously mentioned the same, I have taken a note of it and in the meanwhile we may proceed with the session. I hope we are together in this?
18/1/24, 2:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For now, I only need you to let me know at what time you wish to have our session tomorrow so that we can move forward with your admission process. I hope I am clear?
18/1/24, 2:28 PM - +263 71 250 1277: Yes ma'am
18/1/24, 2:29 PM - +263 71 250 1277: Yes. 10AM is ok
18/1/24, 2:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 10:00 AM for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to go through the videos. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed rest of the day and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
18/1/24, 2:42 PM - +263 71 250 1277: Thank you ma'am, you too.
19/1/24, 7:10 AM - +263 71 250 1277: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 7:56 AM - +263 71 250 1277: 2. The Business Process Management (BPM) life cycle is a comprehensive approach to improving business processes through a series of systematic steps. The life cycle consists of five stages: identify, design, implement, monitor, and optimize. The first stage, identify, involves identifying the current business process and understanding its strengths and weaknesses. The second stage, design, involves creating a new, improved process based on the insights gained in the identify stage. The third stage, implement, involves putting the new process into practice and ensuring that it is running smoothly. The fourth stage, monitor, involves tracking the results of the new process and making any necessary adjustments. Finally, the fifth stage, optimize, involves continuously improving the process based on the feedback and data gathered from the previous stages. By following this life cycle, businesses can create a process that is more efficient, effective, and customer-focused.
19/1/24, 7:58 AM - +263 71 250 1277: 3. Businesses contribute to economic development in a number of ways. Firstly, they provide goods and services that meet the needs of consumers and businesses, thereby increasing the standard of living and boosting economic growth. Secondly, businesses create jobs, which in turn increases income and spending levels, which further fuels economic development. Thirdly, businesses generate tax revenue, which is used by governments to fund public services and infrastructure, further supporting economic development. An example of this is a country like China, which has seen rapid economic development in recent decades due to the growth of businesses such as Alibaba and Tencent. The growth of Alibaba and Tencent, two of China's largest tech companies, has contributed significantly to the country's economic development. Alibaba, which started as an e-commerce platform, has expanded into a variety of other businesses, including cloud computing, logistics, and media. Tencent, which began as a messaging and gaming company, has branched out into online banking, e-commerce, and artificial intelligence. Both companies have created millions of jobs, while also generating significant tax revenue for the Chinese government. Additionally, they have helped other businesses to grow and expand, further driving economic development in China. <This message was edited>
19/1/24, 8:19 AM - +263 71 250 1277: 4. Business ethics refers to the moral and ethical principles that guide a company's conduct. This includes how businesses interact with their employees, customers, suppliers, competitors, and the broader community. It also involves ensuring that companies operate in a legal and fair manner. Business ethics is important because it helps to create trust and credibility for a company. Customers are more likely to do business with a company that they believe is acting ethically, and employees are more likely to be engaged and productive in a company that shares their values. A lack of business ethics can lead to scandals, which can damage a company's reputation and bottom line.
19/1/24, 8:20 AM - +263 71 250 1277: 5. Human resources (HR) is a crucial part of any organization, as it's responsible for recruiting, training, and managing employees. HR plays an important role in attracting and retaining top talent, and it helps to ensure that employees are motivated and productive. Additionally, HR helps to create and maintain a healthy work environment, and it enforces company policies and procedures. Without an effective HR department, an organization may struggle to meet its goals and objectives. For example, without proper recruitment and training, companies may find it difficult to fill key positions and develop a skilled workforce. Therefore, it's clear that HR is an essential part of any successful organizatio.

Since we are awaiting your response to the form, in the meanwhile we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
19/1/24, 11:05 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 15 February 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
19/1/24, 11:10 AM - +263 71 250 1277: Yes my parents have been preparing accordingly to meet the deadline for the balance
19/1/24, 11:24 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.
19/1/24, 11:24 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Diploma in Business Administration and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
19/1/24, 11:25 AM - +263 71 250 1277: Yes ma'am it is accurate
19/1/24, 11:35 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
19/1/24, 11:35 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
19/1/24, 11:35 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
19/1/24, 11:35 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
19/1/24, 11:41 AM - +263 71 250 1277: Yes it's not possible
19/1/24, 11:51 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
19/1/24, 11:51 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
19/1/24, 11:51 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee.
19/1/24, 11:51 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
19/1/24, 11:58 AM - +263 71 250 1277: Yes we discussed it thoroughly
19/1/24, 12:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
19/1/24, 12:52 PM - +263 71 250 1277: We are together ma'am
19/1/24, 12:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
19/1/24, 12:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*

Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
19/1/24, 1:00 PM - +263 71 250 1277: Yes I have
19/1/24, 3:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you have taken a note of the fee breakup, Junior. I apologize for the delay in my response as I had to attend an urgent work-related meeting. I hope you are still available to continue with our discussion dear?
19/1/24, 3:52 PM - +263 71 250 1277: Yes I am
19/1/24, 3:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
19/1/24, 3:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India.
19/1/24, 3:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
19/1/24, 4:10 PM - +263 71 250 1277: I understand
19/1/24, 4:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
19/1/24, 4:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
19/1/24, 4:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
19/1/24, 4:38 PM - +263 71 250 1277: I understand
19/1/24, 4:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.
19/1/24, 4:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/1/24, 5:08 PM - +263 71 250 1277: No I understand
19/1/24, 5:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
19/1/24, 5:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
19/1/24, 5:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
19/1/24, 5:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 5:19 PM - +263 71 250 1277: I hope so too
19/1/24, 5:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.
19/1/24, 5:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
19/1/24, 5:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
19/1/24, 5:25 PM - +263 71 250 1277: Yes I am
19/1/24, 5:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
19/1/24, 5:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
19/1/24, 5:28 PM - +263 71 250 1277: No I'm not
19/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
19/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university [For most of the universities 15 days]. Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
19/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
19/1/24, 5:42 PM - +263 71 250 1277: No I understand
19/1/24, 5:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move forward, may I know if you were able to complete this form, dear? Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a very vital document for your application, as it serves as a personalized and comprehensive document that highlights your motivations, qualifications, and goals, providing admissions committees with valuable insights into your application. Since it is a subjective document, your inputs are quite important. After taking your detailed inputs, the Edoofa team will provide assistance in improving or improvising your SOP and then include the same in your application profile. <This message was edited>
19/1/24, 5:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Excuse me for not attaching the message previously, dear. I am referring to the form mentioned in this message.

19/1/24, 6:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Could you kindly let me know by when you expect your results to be released, dear?
19/1/24, 6:14 PM - +263 71 250 1277: The national schools examination council has not announced when they'd be releasing the results yet
19/1/24, 6:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, dear, you will have to share with me your Statement of Entry for your O-Level exams. May I know if you have it with you?
19/1/24, 6:30 PM - +263 71 250 1277: Yes I do
19/1/24, 6:30 PM - +263 71 250 1277: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 6:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your statement of entry with me. I will be waiting for you to give me a confirmation regarding filling the SOP form.
