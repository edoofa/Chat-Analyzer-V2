16/1/24, 12:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Munashe,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

17/1/24, 7:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Munashe,

Thank you for sharing your results with us. I noticed that your A-level results didn't turn out as we had hoped, particularly with the challenge in one subject. However, I want to take a moment to remind you that this result is not a reflection of your abilities or potential. It's simply a hurdle on your academic journey, one that you are more than capable of overcoming.
17/1/24, 7:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It's important to remember that everyone faces setbacks at some point. What matters most is how we respond to them. This is an opportunity for growth and learning. Reflect on the experience, identify areas for improvement, and use this as a stepping stone towards future successes.
17/1/24, 7:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Rest assured, that you have Edoofa’s full support in navigating this phase. Whether it's discussing options for retaking the exam, exploring alternative career paths, or just needing someone to guide you, we are here for you. 

I have taken note of your results and I will add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
17/1/24, 7:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly allow us some time to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, we will reconnect with you to discuss the next steps in your academic journey.
17/1/24, 7:42 PM - +263 71 313 8460: Greetings and Good Evening to you Ms Siddhi . Indeed my results did not turn out quite well as you mentioned. I too feel quite demotivated to take a step further . 

However even Mr Napoleon Hill once mentioned that" Faith is a powerful force that can help you overcome any obstacles that stand in the way of your goals. Also belief, convo build faith, you need to believe in yourself and your abilities, have a clear vision of what you want to achieve, and take consistent action towards your goals." Therefore l won't back down but will continue to move forward hoping to succeed. As you also said too Ms Siddhi that this is an opportunity for growth and learning therefore l will  reflect and improve myself and use it as a stepping stone towards my future successes.
 My parents and l will be patiently waiting for feedback Ms Siddhi. Have a good day .
19/1/24, 12:37 PM - +263 71 313 8460: Alright
