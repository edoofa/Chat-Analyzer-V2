I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
17/1/24, 8:52 AM - +263 71 523 9347: Yes it's clear
17/1/24, 8:54 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end.

I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counselling session with your counsellor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?

17/1/24, 9:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The column "orientation availability" refers to a 3-day window following the commencement of your EWYL program, which, in your case, is on January 23. After the initiation, you will have a 3-day period during which you will commence your EWYL orientation, specifically from January 23 to January 26 in your situation. Your EWYL program initiation date remains January 23, and you are required to input a date between January 23 and January 26 for your Orientation program. It is permissible for both the EWYL Program availability and Orientation availability to share the same date. If you are available for the orientation on January 23 itself, kindly indicate so. I hope I am clear?

17/1/24, 10:10 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Along with these forms, I have asked you to share your academic documents with us. I am currently waiting for that as well.

Moving forward, as a part of your application file, you will need to visit your school and secure a letter of recommendation from them. We have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process.
17/1/24, 10:11 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, *your subject combination for A Level exams*, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
17/1/24, 10:11 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to inquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?
17/1/24, 10:16 AM - +263 71 523 9347: Ok  Ms Siddhi
17/1/24, 10:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

17/1/24, 11:27 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In case it is very inconvenient for you to get a Letter of Recommendation, and you have your A-Level Results or Statement of Entry with you, you can share the same.
17/1/24, 11:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I hope you are clear about the same?

17/1/24, 11:40 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: For the next couple of days, we will have sessions on a daily basis and once we cover the first three steps of the admission cycle, we will have sessions scheduled on a need basis. Hence, can you let me know at what time you would like us to schedule our sessions on a daily basis (from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM)?

18/1/24, 10:01 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Am I correct?
18/1/24, 10:02 AM - +263 71 523 9347: Ok
18/1/24, 10:14 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: For today's date you can enter the same i.e., 18 January. Your EWYL Program is scheduled to begin on 23 January. Hence your EWYL Program Availability date will be 23 January. In case you are unavailable on the date, you need to inform us so that we can reschedule your EWYL Program commencement accordingly.
18/1/24, 10:15 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Lastly, the column "orientation availability" refers to a 3-day window following the commencement of your EWYL program, which, in your case, is on January 23. After the initiation, you will have a 3-day period during which you will commence your EWYL orientation, specifically from January 23 to January 26 in your situation. Your EWYL program initiation date remains January 23, and you are required to input a date between January 23 and January 26 for your Orientation program. It is permissible for both the EWYL Program availability and Orientation availability to share the same date. If you are available for the orientation on January 23 itself, kindly indicate so. I hope I am clear?
18/1/24, 10:15 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I hope this was helpful, dear?

For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
18/1/24, 12:05 PM - +263 71 523 9347: Yes
18/1/24, 12:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 12:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, I would encourage you to go through the above image representing your university admission process and once you are done, let me know so that I can explain the same to you in detail.
18/1/24, 12:14 PM - +263 71 523 9347: Yes I'm done
18/1/24, 12:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
18/1/24, 12:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
18/1/24, 12:25 PM - +263 71 523 9347: Explain further the first stage
18/1/24, 12:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: After I am done briefing you about all the 6 steps, we will move forward to the first step i.e., message from the founder's office. Once we commence the step 1, you will be able to gain more clarity on the same. I hope you are following?
18/1/24, 12:29 PM - +263 71 523 9347: Yes
18/1/24, 12:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counselling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counselling session will take about 1 hour.
18/1/24, 12:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
18/1/24, 12:36 PM - +263 71 523 9347: Yes
18/1/24, 12:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
18/1/24, 12:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
18/1/24, 12:40 PM - +263 71 523 9347: Ok I understand
18/1/24, 12:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
18/1/24, 12:58 PM - +263 71 523 9347: I don't have any query
18/1/24, 1:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
18/1/24, 1:00 PM - +263 71 523 9347: Yes
18/1/24, 1:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
18/1/24, 1:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. You may take today’s time for the same. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?
