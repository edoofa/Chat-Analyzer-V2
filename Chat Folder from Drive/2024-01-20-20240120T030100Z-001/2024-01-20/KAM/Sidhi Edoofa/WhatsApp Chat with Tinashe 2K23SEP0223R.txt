17/1/24, 10:10 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Tinashe 2K23SEP0223R)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
17/1/24, 10:10 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Tinashe EWYL23E0685)* . In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
17/1/24, 10:13 AM - +263 78 555 3504: Yes, thank you. I understand.
17/1/24, 10:26 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counsellor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counselling session with your counsellor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
17/1/24, 10:31 AM - +263 78 555 3504: Thank you very much.

The EWYL program has been the most impressive in my opinion. Not only is it an amenity to fund my education, it seems like an excellent learning opportunity as well.
17/1/24, 10:38 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you find the program to be so helpful.
17/1/24, 10:38 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moving forward with the procedures, I would like to share an insight with you. To ensure a seamless experience, we, as a team, have prepared essential documents that not only value your feedback but also outline the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program and the application process. You will have to review, complete, and submit these documents as instructed. 

If you are ready, shall I share a brief overview of these documents for your ease?

17/1/24, 11:36 AM - +263 78 555 3504: Right now I'm experiencing technical difficulties, are you able to send and I can review it later on?

17/1/24, 12:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The column "orientation availability" refers to a 3-day window following the commencement of your EWYL program, which, in your case, is on January 23. After the initiation, you will have a 3-day period during which you will commence your EWYL orientation, specifically from January 23 to January 26 in your situation. Your EWYL program initiation date remains January 23, and you are required to input a date between January 23 and January 26 for your Orientation program. It is permissible for both the EWYL Program availability and Orientation availability to share the same date. If you are available for the orientation on January 23 itself, kindly indicate so. I hope I am clear?
17/1/24, 12:25 PM - +263 78 555 3504: I have a question regarding the orientation of the EWYL Program.
Do I have to have access to the Internet for me to take part?
17/1/24, 12:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, dear. You will require internet access to be able to participate in the program. However, the sessions will mostly be conducted through WhatsApp itself, but the activities may require you to access internet. I hope I am clear?
17/1/24, 12:32 PM - +263 78 555 3504: I understand fully. Thank you.
17/1/24, 12:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that and I am looking forward to getting an update from your end. I would also like to reiterate that our operational hours are from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM, Central African Time.
17/1/24, 12:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Considering this, for our future sessions, you have to decide on an hour’s time that suits your availability within this timeframe and share the same with us so that we can tailor our subsequent sessions to accommodate your schedule effectively.
17/1/24, 12:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For the next couple of days, we will have sessions on a daily basis and once we cover the first three steps of the admission cycle, we will have sessions scheduled on a need basis. Hence, can you let me know at what time you would like us to schedule our sessions on a daily basis (from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM)?
17/1/24, 12:36 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Eight am to four pm is fine, thank you.
17/1/24, 12:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 8:00 AM for our next session.

18/1/24, 9:07 AM - +263 78 555 3504: Morning ma'am, I'm doing well thank you, how are you?

18/1/24, 9:50 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are ready, shall we proceed with our session?
18/1/24, 10:19 AM - +263 78 555 3504: Yes, I am ready to start.
18/1/24, 10:20 AM - +263 78 555 3504: It's alright.
18/1/24, 10:27 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
18/1/24, 10:28 AM - +263 78 555 3504: Yes, we may proceed, thank you.
18/1/24, 10:37 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 10:37 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, I would encourage you to go through the above image representing your university admission process and once you are done, let me know so that I can explain the same to you in detail.
18/1/24, 10:42 AM - +263 78 555 3504: I have gone through it, you may begin the explaining.
18/1/24, 10:44 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
18/1/24, 10:45 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
18/1/24, 10:47 AM - +263 78 555 3504: Yes, I fully understand both explanations, thank you.
18/1/24, 10:53 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counselling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counselling session will take about 1 hour.
18/1/24, 10:53 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
18/1/24, 10:55 AM - +263 78 555 3504: Yes, I follow.
18/1/24, 10:56 AM - +263 78 555 3504: Am I the one who chooses the university I want to go to or the board does it for me?
18/1/24, 11:10 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: After the completion of your application process, the academic board will evaluate your profile and choose the best universities for your field of education. Next, they will send out your application to those universities. In case you receive an offer letter from multiple universities, you will have the option to choose one out of them. As we proceed with our sessions, you will gain more clarity on the admission and registration process. I hope this was helpful?
18/1/24, 11:10 AM - +263 78 555 3504: Yes, this answers my question. Thank you very much.
18/1/24, 11:18 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
18/1/24, 11:18 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
18/1/24, 11:21 AM - +263 78 555 3504: Is the registration fee not covered by the program?
18/1/24, 11:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I did not quite get your question, dear. Would you be kind enough to explain your concern?
18/1/24, 11:30 AM - +263 78 555 3504: The registration fee you mentioned, the one paid to secure enrollment at the chosen university. Do we pay it or Edoofa is the one that pays?
18/1/24, 11:49 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand your query now. Thank you for explaining it. The registration fee is part of your annual tuition fees. The amount you pay during registration to secure your scholarship seat will be readjusted with your annual fees. Hence, the registration fee has to be paid by you. As we proceed with our sessions, you will gain more clarity about the admission process. I hope this was helpful?
18/1/24, 11:53 AM - +263 78 555 3504: Okay, I understand now.
18/1/24, 11:53 AM - +263 78 555 3504: We may proceed.
18/1/24, 12:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
18/1/24, 12:03 PM - +263 78 555 3504: No, I don't have any queries. You already answered all the questions I had.
18/1/24, 12:04 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Thank you.

18/1/24, 12:11 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Yes, we may begin.
18/1/24, 12:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
18/1/24, 12:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. You may take today’s time for the same. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?

19/1/24, 8:22 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tinashe. How are you all doing today?
19/1/24, 8:26 AM - +263 78 555 3504: Good morning ma'am. We're doing well thank you, how are you today?
19/1/24, 8:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you're all doing well. I'm doing fine myself, thank you for asking dear. May I know if you were able to go through the videos in detail?
19/1/24, 8:30 AM - +263 78 555 3504: Yes, I was able to watch all the videos.
19/1/24, 8:35 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Could you kindly share your understanding of each video individually, dear?
19/1/24, 8:50 AM - +263 78 555 3504: I'm just going to summarise the key points I managed to note in each video.

In the first video, the founders urged us to be very open minded. They told us that we should be teachable in order to excel in the program. They also said we should be able to follow instructions.

In the second video, they emphasised that Edoofa's vision is not just about giving people affordable education, but it's to guide them to be more employable. They aim to bolster our capacity of success in turn making us as students self dependent and more responsible.

The founders also stressed how they spent a lot of time acquiring a number of good schools and universities. This was done over a period of ten years and they tell us this in the third video. They urged us to follow instructions again to be prepared and qualified for such institutions.

In the fourth and final video, the founders explain what the statement of purpose is. From my understanding, I managed to note that this document is important for convincing institutions to take me on as their student. They also urged us to be prompt in taking action and fill out the form.
19/1/24, 9:08 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Brilliant, you seem to have understood the founders’ message quite well! I am glad that you were able to go through the videos so thoroughly. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
19/1/24, 9:10 AM - +263 78 555 3504: Yes, we're on the same page... You may proceed.
19/1/24, 9:25 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 9:00 AM.
19/1/24, 9:25 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.
