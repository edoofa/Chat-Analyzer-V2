6/1/24, 10:28 AM - Dev Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
6/1/24, 10:33 AM - +263 77 377 5772: Sure , we can start now .
6/1/24, 10:43 AM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/1/24, 11:10 AM - +263 77 377 5772: I have gone through the image sir.
6/1/24, 11:23 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
6/1/24, 11:23 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
6/1/24, 11:40 AM - +263 77 377 5772: Yes, they are very well understood and clear sir.
6/1/24, 11:53 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
6/1/24, 11:53 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
6/1/24, 12:01 PM - +263 77 377 5772: Yes lm following.
6/1/24, 12:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
6/1/24, 12:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
6/1/24, 12:08 PM - +263 77 377 5772: All clear Mr. Dev
6/1/24, 12:10 PM - +263 77 377 5772: So the registration fee is to be paid before going to lndia.
6/1/24, 12:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes @263773775772, the registration fees is paid while the student is still in the home country. Once we move forward with the further process, you will soon get to know how and when this fees is to be paid.
6/1/24, 12:18 PM - +263 77 377 5772: Noted sir
6/1/24, 12:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
6/1/24, 1:33 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Yes sure.
8/1/24, 9:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Ashley!
I hope all of you are doing great. While I was wrapping up my day, I observed that we were not able to have a smooth discussion for the past couple of days, which has led to some delay in the admission process. We are aware of your immense trust in us and we surely care about your future. Considering that in mind, I wanted to schedule a specific session tomorrow at 8:30 am so that we can cover the process we are lagging behind,  and ensure that your admission process is on track. Hence, I wanted to understand if you will be available for our session at 8:30am. If not, I would like you to please let me know at what time between 8:30 am to 4 pm will you be available?
8/1/24, 9:09 PM - +263 71 745 9650: I will be available at 8.30 am
8/1/24, 9:09 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Greetings to you
9/1/24, 8:51 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Ashley!
I hope all of you are having a wonderful morning. I extremely excited to take forward your admission process today and I trust that you are as well. Let's start with our session.
9/1/24, 3:39 PM - +263 77 377 5772: How are doing.We are doing great as well
9/1/24, 4:24 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Good afternoon sir , my apologies for not responding to the messages , today was the opening of schools and l was occupied with some school stuff
9/1/24, 4:25 PM - +263 71 745 9650: I'm very sorry sir. Tomorrow l will surely be available.
9/1/24, 8:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Ashley.

I hope all of you are having a wonderful day. Today I had a meeting with the academic board and I was discussing the current status of your application file and in the same discussion, the team higjlighted that we have been a bit off track for the discusisons we were suppsed to completed and hence I wanted to reach out to you and just reiteratre the agenda of the sessions/discusisons we have in place.
9/1/24, 8:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: The agenda for these sessions is to help you understand the process Ashley will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since Ashley is in school and you are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
9/1/24, 8:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see, our goal is to help you prepare for your child's education abroad, that is something that is going to require a significant time. It requires months of planning. Hence, to do that perfectly and be prepared, as a parent, you would have to contribute an hour daily for at least 10 days so that we can be in sync and make the right decisions.
9/1/24, 8:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: We, at Edoofa, are determined to provide affordable higher education to hardworking students and assist them in launching their careers to greater heights. We will be able to help you only if we can connect timely and have healthy discussions.
9/1/24, 8:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January]. This way, we can align it with our availability as well and help you move forward and make progress in a streamlined manner. Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your inputs and find the right time for our sessions.
9/1/24, 9:20 PM - +263 71 745 9650: 09:00 AM is the best
9/1/24, 9:27 PM - +263 77 377 5772: Good evening team,we are very sorry sure for not being able to coorperate very well due to network problem and also time alocation
10/1/24, 9:17 AM - +263 71 745 9650: Good morning to you all.
How are you doing today ?
12/1/24, 11:14 AM - +263 71 745 9650: Greetings to you all.
12/1/24, 1:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ashley!
I hope all of you are doing well. I have taken note of the above timings that were shared by you. I would like you to kindly provide me with some time to look into my schedule and provide you with confirmation regarding this. I hope you understand!
12/1/24, 1:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: Till then, with great excitement and pride, I want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
12/1/24, 1:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experience. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
12/1/24, 1:34 PM - Dev Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we start our session today, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

19/1/24, 10:56 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Ashley!
I am doing well and I hope the same for you as well.
19/1/24, 10:56 AM - +263 71 745 9650: I'm perfectly fine sir .
19/1/24, 10:57 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!

19/1/24, 11:33 AM - +263 71 745 9650: 2). What is the relationship between entrepreneurship and economic development?

Answering the second question , the relationship between entrepreneurship and economic development is complicated and can vary from one country to another based on their level of economic growth . 
In highly developed economies , entrepreneurs can accelerate growth , while in less- developed ones they may have less of a positive effect. Entrepreneurship and economic growth go hand in hand , with innovation acting as a catalyst for growth .
According to my own thinking , there is a strong relationship between entrepreneurship and economic development. Entrepreneurship can drive economic development by creating jobs, boosting productivity, and introducing new technologies and innovations to the market. In addition, entrepreneurs can play a role in solving economic problems by finding creative solutions to issues like poverty, unemployment, and access to basic services. They can also help foster growth in new industries and stimulate demand for goods and services. 
To facilitate innovation driven entrepreneurship, government and institutions play a crucial role by fostering an environment that supports sustained economic development.
19/1/24, 11:36 AM - +263 71 745 9650: 3). Please share your understanding of GAAP and it's importance ?

GAAP ( Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ) are the guidelines by which most finance professionals record and report financial performance In a company . GAAP is important because it helps to ensure that financial statements are consistent, accurate, and reliable. This allows businesses to make informed decisions, and it also allows investors and other stakeholders to make informed decisions about a company. GAAP also helps to promote transparency and fairness in the financial reporting process. GAAP also helps to prevent misrepresentation in financial reporting. It  also promotes efficient capital markets, as investors can rely on the accuracy of financial statements when making investment decisions. 
While GAAP is not regulated by Government, it was created through a collaboration between business and government. It isn't mandatory for all businesses , but is highly recommend, especially if one plans to eventually go public or if you expect to be raising capital or preparing for another transaction in the near future . 
Finally , GAAP promotes consistency , as it allows for apples -to- apples comparisons of financial statements from different companies.
19/1/24, 11:37 AM - +263 71 745 9650: 4). What are accounting standards and why are they mandatory? 

Accounting standards are a set of rules and guidelines that govern how financial information is recorded and reported. Accounting standards are developed by professional organizations, such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the United States. These standards are mandatory because they help to ensure that financial reporting is consistent and reliable. Without accounting standards, companies could potentially report their financial information in a way that is misleading or even fraudulent.
Accounting standards are the primary source of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) .
Mandatory standards help to ensure that companies follow best practices when it comes to financial reporting. They help to protect the interests of stakeholders, including investors and creditors. Mandatory standards help to promote transparency and accountability within the financial system. They specify how transactions and other events are to be recognized, measured , presented and disclosed in financial statements. 
It is mandatory for companies to follow accounting standards as it ensures uniformity in the accounting process and also make statements comparable with other organizations.  Finally, they help to level the playing field for companies, so that everyone is playing by the same rules.
19/1/24, 11:37 AM - +263 71 745 9650: 5). Please differentiate between accounting and auditing ?

Accounting and auditing are two closely related but distinct fields. accounting involves the recording, classifying, and summarizing of financial transactions, while auditing involves the examination and evaluation of the accuracy of financial statements. In other words, accounting focuses on the collection and preparation of financial information, while auditing focuses on the review and verification of that information. 
One major difference is in the objectives of each field. The objective of accounting is to provide useful financial information to decision makers, while the objective of auditing is to provide an independent opinion on the fairness of the financial statements. Another difference is in the parties that each field serves. Accounting serves internal parties, such as management, while auditing serves external parties, such as investors and creditors.
In simple terms accounting is the continuous process of managing and maintaining financial records . Whereas auditing is a periodic process that validates the accuracy of financial statements .
19/1/24, 3:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ashley!
I hope you are doing well. Thank you for providing the responses to the documents, I have taken note of these and will update them in our records. We have our session right now. May I know if you are ready to take forward our conversation?
19/1/24, 3:10 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Yes, absolutely.
19/1/24, 3:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is good to know! With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
19/1/24, 3:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
19/1/24, 3:19 PM - +263 71 745 9650: All in progress and l will pay next week
19/1/24, 3:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. I have taken note of it and have updated the accounts team as well.
19/1/24, 3:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: In the meantime. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BCom and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
19/1/24, 3:28 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Absolutely correct
19/1/24, 3:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
19/1/24, 3:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
19/1/24, 3:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
19/1/24, 3:35 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Yes sure .
19/1/24, 3:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
19/1/24, 3:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
19/1/24, 3:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
19/1/24, 3:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
19/1/24, 3:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
19/1/24, 3:48 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Also wish for the same
19/1/24, 3:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
19/1/24, 3:49 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Yes sure please
19/1/24, 3:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
19/1/24, 3:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
19/1/24, 3:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
19/1/24, 3:51 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Strongly agree
19/1/24, 3:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
19/1/24, 3:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
19/1/24, 3:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
19/1/24, 3:54 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Strongly believe the same sir
19/1/24, 3:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
19/1/24, 3:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
19/1/24, 3:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
19/1/24, 3:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
19/1/24, 3:56 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Correct
19/1/24, 3:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
19/1/24, 4:02 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Please do sir
19/1/24, 4:41 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is Ms. Aditi and she has scheduled my session for Monday .
19/1/24, 5:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay by tomorrow before your due date.
19/1/24, 5:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
19/1/24, 5:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
19/1/24, 6:37 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Yes sure lm also wondering the same
