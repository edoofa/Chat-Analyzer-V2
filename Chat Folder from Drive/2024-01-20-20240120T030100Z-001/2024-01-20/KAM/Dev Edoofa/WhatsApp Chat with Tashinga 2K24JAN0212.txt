16/1/24, 3:11 PM - +263 71 238 8180: Certainly, sir. My name is Tashinga Prunella Musonza, an ambitious and dedicated individual with a strong passion for academics, making a global impact and leadership. I thoroughly enjoy both reading and creating educational content, which is evident in my role as the Head Facilitator for STEM-. This position showcases my empathetic nature, as I strive to support and guide others in their learning journey. Additionally, serving as a Junior Parliamentarian has further fueled my desire to study Law, as it has instilled in me the importance of advocating for the rights and well-being of others. I am highly self-critical and constantly strive for excellence in all that I do. As the second child in my family, I am fortunate to have a loving and supportive household that encourages me to reach my fullest potential. My father and mother generously sponsor my education and have consistently demonstrated their dedication to nurturing my career growth. <This message was edited>
16/1/24, 3:18 PM - +263 77 226 1676: Good day Sir. Here is trusting that I find you well. Had been in a Zoom meeting since midday but glad to say I have been freed now. Please be assured that you have a complete buy in from us concerning our daughter Tashinga's enrolment process which is underway. We support this worthy initiative without equivocation. In addition we stand prepared to do our part as her patents/guardians in ensuring that all the necessary steps are taken and satisfactorily concluded. Please accept my warmest regards.
16/1/24, 3:25 PM - Dev Edoofa: We surely appreciate your kind words for us. Thank you so much!
16/1/24, 3:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you Tashinga for providing your detailed introduction. We appreciate your hard work and forward thinking of making an impact. There is a very small percentage of students of your age have such kind of maturity. It is truly appreciated.
16/1/24, 3:32 PM - +263 71 238 8180: I'm truly grateful for your acknowledgement, Sir. It means a great deal to me to have my efforts recognized by someone as esteemed as yourself.
16/1/24, 3:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your kind words.
16/1/24, 3:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: Moving forward, I would like to bring an important aspect to your attention. The collective aim that we have for the student strongly values balanced involvement from parents, especially when the student is unable to participate. Your proactive engagement holds significant weight, and if, for any reason, either you or your guardians won't be available, we kindly request you to inform us beforehand so that we can plan and schedule our discussion beforehand. I hope you have taken note of this as well?
16/1/24, 3:45 PM - +263 71 238 8180: We have taken note of this Sir, and we are in agreement with the proposed schedule.
16/1/24, 3:57 PM - +263 77 226 1676: To add to Tashinga's response, we hereby assure your good office that Tashinga's participation in all engagements going forward is fully guaranteed. However myself and her mother may fail to participate in some of these future sessions as scheduled due to work commitments. At the same time we will strive that despite the just mentioned we will strive to have one of us or both participate with our daughter in all scheduled future engagements with yourselves.
16/1/24, 4:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting us know about the availabilities of your Mr. Musonza. We have taken a note of it.
16/1/24, 4:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: Shall we move forward with our conversation?
16/1/24, 4:22 PM - +263 71 238 8180: Yes Sir
16/1/24, 4:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: Fantastic! Now over the next four days, our focus as your admission team will be on equipping you with a comprehensive understanding of what lies ahead in your university admission journey and help you commence the same.
16/1/24, 4:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: Soon after, we will guide you through the initiation of your EWYL Journey. The next batch of EWYL Sessions is scheduled to commence on Tuesday(January 23rd) and hence, if we are able to focus and complete the Admission Process before Friday with pure consistency, you will be able to start your EWYL journey as well in a timely manner.
16/1/24, 4:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: Kindly mark this date on your calendar and ensure that you are available to complete the necessary procedures within the stipulated timeline. If everything is proceeding as planned so far, shall we move forward and begin our session for the day?
16/1/24, 4:30 PM - +263 71 238 8180: Yes, Sir. That would be great.
16/1/24, 4:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
16/1/24, 4:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *Tashinga 2K24JAN0212*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
16/1/24, 4:34 PM - Dev Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *Tashinga EWYL23E1168*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
16/1/24, 4:56 PM - +263 71 238 8180: Everything is clear now Sir.
16/1/24, 5:02 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
16/1/24, 5:36 PM - +263 71 238 8180: One aspect of the Edoofa Scholarship Program that particularly impressed me was its commitment to providing high-quality and cost-effective education. India is renowned for its excellent educational opportunities, and this program truly stood out in that regard. Additionally, the "Earn while you learn" feature greatly appealed to me as it effectively addresses financial constraints. With so many positive aspects to choose from, it is difficult for me to single out just one favorite aspect.
16/1/24, 5:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: EWYL program provides the opportunity for hardworking students to self-finance their higher education on top of the scholarship provided in the Edoofa scholarship program.
This program also assists the students to have a finesse on skills that are prerequisites before venturing into any field and climbing the ladder of success. We are grateful that you are impressed by this program!
16/1/24, 5:43 PM - +263 71 238 8180: Yes, Sir. Thank you for the insight.
16/1/24, 5:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome. May I know, if you have printed the forms that were shared with you?
16/1/24, 5:46 PM - +263 71 238 8180: Yes Sir, l have printed both forms.
16/1/24, 5:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to know that! To ensure a seamless experience, we as a team, have prepared essential documents that not only value your feedback but also outline the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program and the application process. You will have to review, complete, and submit these documents as instructed. 

If you are ready, shall I share a brief overview of these documents for your ease?
16/1/24, 5:54 PM - +263 71 238 8180: Yes Sir, kindly do so.
16/1/24, 6:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! Take note that you will get time to fill out these forms.

17/1/24, 12:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: Fantastic! Before moving forward, may I get an update on the printed forms that were shared with you, are they completely filled?
17/1/24, 12:43 PM - +263 71 238 8180: I apologize for the inconvenience, but I have not had the opportunity to obtain a passport size photo for the final documentation and my recommendation letter. Could this potentially hinder the commencement of our session?
17/1/24, 12:53 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, Tashinga,. Without completely filling out the forms that were shared with you, we can't move forward with the session. I would recommend you to arrange for the passport size photo by today. We will connect tomorrow at 12pm to move forward with our session.
17/1/24, 12:53 PM - Dev Edoofa: Until then please share the screenshot of the online google form as well as the EWYL form.

18/1/24, 9:30 AM - +263 71 238 8180: Good morning, Sir. I hope you had a restful night. I would like to seek clarification regarding your mention of "A level results." Is it acceptable if I provide both my A level results for both terms as an alternative to the recommendation letter? Unfortunately, my school currently does not have electricity to facilitate typing or printing of the document.
18/1/24, 12:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tashinga! I hope you are doing well. I have taken note of your concern you may send your A level results for now but also keep in mind that you have to share the recommendation letter as well.

18/1/24, 12:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: First of all! Thank you for sharing the documents. I have taken note of it and will update in our records as well.
18/1/24, 12:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
18/1/24, 12:50 PM - +263 71 238 8180: Noted Sir, we may start our discussion
18/1/24, 12:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright please, I would encourage you to go through the above image representing your university admission process and once you are done, let me know so that I can explain the same to you in detail.
18/1/24, 12:57 PM - +263 71 238 8180: Which image Sir?
18/1/24, 12:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for noticing, there was technical glitch due to which this happened.
18/1/24, 12:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 1:00 PM - +263 71 238 8180: Thank you very much Sir. You may proceed.
18/1/24, 1:01 PM - +263 77 226 1676: It is indeed self-explanatory. Many thanks Sir.
18/1/24, 1:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
18/1/24, 1:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
18/1/24, 1:11 PM - +263 77 226 1676: Perfectly clear Sir.
18/1/24, 1:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
18/1/24, 1:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
18/1/24, 1:16 PM - +263 71 238 8180: I am following Sir, everything is clear.
18/1/24, 1:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
18/1/24, 1:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
18/1/24, 1:22 PM - +263 77 226 1676: Quite clear Sir.
18/1/24, 1:24 PM - +263 71 238 8180: This is quite clear Sir, thank you.
18/1/24, 1:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. You are most welcome. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*? <This message was edited>
