21/12/23, 6:38 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Tinotenda!

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. May I know if you are currently available so that we can proceed with the session for your admission process?
28/12/23, 6:02 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

As it has been a while. May I know how are you doing today?
28/12/23, 6:25 PM - +263 78 565 9890: Hello, we are doing okay

28/12/23, 7:56 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the forms with me. Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
28/12/23, 8:22 PM - +263 71 557 5509: we may start.
28/12/23, 8:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
28/12/23, 8:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
28/12/23, 8:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
28/12/23, 8:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
28/12/23, 8:27 PM - +263 71 557 5509: yes that's true.
28/12/23, 8:30 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any addional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
28/12/23, 8:30 PM - +263 71 557 5509: yes please.
28/12/23, 8:32 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay by tomorrow before your due date of December 29, 2023.
28/12/23, 8:32 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
28/12/23, 8:32 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
28/12/23, 8:39 PM - +263 71 557 5509: the remaining $150 was paid today, and we sent thems receipts to Mr Austin but he hasn't viewed them...i think he busy
28/12/23, 9:09 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, in the meantime shall we proceed with the session for the admission process
28/12/23, 9:12 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As much as I wanted to proceed with the session my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow properly again. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
28/12/23, 9:12 PM - +263 71 557 5509: yes
28/12/23, 9:13 PM - +263 71 557 5509: thank you and same to you
29/12/23, 9:22 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was not able to continue with the session today as I was on a call with the university officials. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing the session for today and let us connect on the 2nd of January. Along with that, as we stand on the threshold of a new year, I extend my heartfelt wishes to you and your family for a prosperous and fulfilling 2024. May this year bring new opportunities, fresh beginnings, and the realization of your dreams and aspirations.

I hope the coming year is filled with success, health, and happiness for you and your loved ones. May it be a year that surpasses all expectations and is replete with moments of joy and achievement.

Wishing you a Happy New Year⭐

29/12/23, 9:23 PM - +263 71 557 5509: Thank you for that..and same to you
2/1/24, 6:36 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Eevning dear parent and my dear student!

I hope you had your wonderful holidays with your loved ones. As we embark on a furitful fresh new year. May I know if you are now reay to proceed with the session for the admisison process for today?
2/1/24, 7:23 PM - +263 78 565 9890: Ye we  had great holidays  ,hope you did too.He ready for the session.
2/1/24, 8:29 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session?
2/1/24, 8:59 PM - +263 71 557 5509: yes am ready
3/1/24, 6:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well and blessed. Please excuse me for not being able to connect with you yesterday as I was on a call with the university officials. May I know if you are currently available to proceed with the session?
3/1/24, 7:07 PM - +263 71 557 5509: we may proceed
3/1/24, 7:13 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
3/1/24, 7:13 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fee.
3/1/24, 7:13 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
3/1/24, 7:13 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
3/1/24, 7:15 PM - +263 71 557 5509: soo you saying the installments are a *must*
3/1/24, 8:04 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, indeed they are.
3/1/24, 8:04 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
3/1/24, 8:08 PM - +263 71 557 5509: does every Edoofa applicant does this?
3/1/24, 9:17 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, indeed they did.
6/1/24, 12:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa added Dev Edoofa
6/1/24, 12:30 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Parents of Tinotenda,

I am *Mr. Shivjeet, and I serve as the Admission Officer at Edoofa.* I wanted to extend my heartfelt wishes to you and your family for a prosperous and fulfilling 2024. 

I firmly believe that with the commencement of this new year, comes the promise of fresh beginnings, guiding the way for the actualization of one's deepest dreams and aspirations. As we stand on the threshold of this promising year, I am filled with excitement for the adventures it holds.
6/1/24, 12:30 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the same spirit, I would like to share that I am embarking on a journey as I prepare myself to pursue my doctorate and take a step forward in my academic pursuits. This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.
6/1/24, 12:30 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The decision to transition to a new phase in my life presents an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of students, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience remain enriched and fulfilling.

As I embark on this new journey, I want to assure you that I have entrusted your application file to capable hands. From this point forward, your admission journey will be seamlessly guided by one of our accomplished admission officers, *Mr. Dev,* who will connect with you on Monday.  I hope you will make yourself available for further procedures and will give your best to your career.
6/1/24, 12:30 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments. Wish you all the best, and God Bless.

6/1/24, 9:13 PM - +263 71 557 5509: God bless you too.
9/1/24, 9:34 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tinotenda,

I am *Mr. Dev Kumar, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honored to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realizing your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
9/1/24, 9:34 PM - Dev Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
9/1/24, 9:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test. This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
9/1/24, 9:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
10/1/24, 12:53 PM - +263 71 557 5509: Wes started good <This message was edited>
12/1/24, 10:12 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to know that you had a great start to the year and I hope you are excited for the new day and most importantly the new year as well. @263715575509 , the new year brings about a transformative mindset in us which may not emphasize immediate changes but a change in the direction that you believe is needed.

If I talk about myself, I have made a resolution to bring more humility in myself and bring about a change in my perspective to be a better version of myself all while ensuring that I help all of our students to achieve their educational goals. With that said, I would like to know what aspirations or a change in your approach towards life you wish to achieve?
12/1/24, 10:24 AM - +263 71 557 5509: I wish to change the world for the better. Security wise
12/1/24, 10:24 AM - +263 71 557 5509: also my financial status
12/1/24, 4:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad that you are determined to provide your family with great opportunities. I truly appreciate it.
12/1/24, 4:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, moving towards the admission process, We, at Edoofa, are determined to provide affordable higher education to hardworking students and assist them in launching their careers to greater heights. We will be able to help you only if we can connect timely and have healthy discussions.
12/1/24, 4:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, this is something I want to inform you all that the agenda for the discussions, that we are going to have, is to help you all understand the process you will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since you are going to be occupied with school and your parents are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
12/1/24, 4:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January]. This way, we can align it with our availability as well and help you move forward and make progress in a streamlined manner. Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your input and find the right time for our sessions.
13/1/24, 7:32 AM - +263 71 557 5509: We can try 4pm-6pm
19/1/24, 8:34 PM - +263 71 557 5509: hello *EDOOFA*  can you please tell us what's with the hold up.
