I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
8/1/24, 5:46 PM - +263 78 499 5799: So sir can I ask something
9/1/24, 1:34 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Oslie!
I hope all of you are having a wonderful day ahead. We are excited to take forward the admission process and I trust that you are excited as well. Before starting our session, may I please know how are you all doing today?
9/1/24, 1:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: Since our operational hours were over yesterday, we were not able to reconnect. You can surely ask your query.
9/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 78 499 5799: Good afternoon sir we are all fine
9/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 78 499 5799: Sir I will be leaving for school tomorrow and we are not allowed to go with cellphones so are you comfortable to carry on without me
9/1/24, 1:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to know that, Mavis. I trust that you are going to excel in your semester at school.
9/1/24, 1:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: I completely understand your situation. What we can do is that, since you are going to be unavailable for further sessions, your parents/guardians can take part in these sessions and regularly update you with the proceedings in these sessions.
9/1/24, 1:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: Please let me know what do you feel about this?
9/1/24, 1:51 PM - +263 78 499 5799: Thank you so much sir I hope I will be frequently update

9/1/24, 1:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
9/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 78 499 5799: Yes we can start sir
9/1/24, 2:11 PM - +263 77 238 5097: Good afternoon,i am available for some time. We can proceed.
9/1/24, 2:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
9/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 77 238 5097: I have gone through it.
9/1/24, 2:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
9/1/24, 2:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
9/1/24, 2:37 PM - +263 77 238 5097: Yes Mr ,they are clear.
9/1/24, 2:39 PM - +263 78 499 5799: Yes they are clear sir
9/1/24, 2:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
9/1/24, 2:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
9/1/24, 2:50 PM - +263 78 499 5799: Yes I am following
9/1/24, 2:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
9/1/24, 2:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
9/1/24, 2:54 PM - +263 78 499 5799: Yes sir
9/1/24, 2:54 PM - +263 78 499 5799: Does the student acquire the VISA on their own or you will assist
9/1/24, 3:01 PM - +263 77 238 5097: We will assist her.
9/1/24, 3:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: Our DSW team is going to assist you in acquiring a visa and help you with the total process. I hope I was able to clear your query?
9/1/24, 3:09 PM - +263 78 499 5799: Yes you did clear it sir
9/1/24, 4:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! Since our operational hours are over, we will reconnect tomorrow to move forward with our session. Till then I will share with you the First step, i.e., *Message from the founder's office*.
9/1/24, 4:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
9/1/24, 4:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
9/1/24, 4:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

9/1/24, 4:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
9/1/24, 4:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
9/1/24, 4:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: Tanatswa, I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding.
9/1/24, 4:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: Have a great evening ahead!
9/1/24, 4:17 PM - +263 77 238 5097: Same to you Mr Kumar.
12/1/24, 12:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tanatswa!

With great excitement and pride, I want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
12/1/24, 12:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experience. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
12/1/24, 12:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we start our session today, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

15/1/24, 11:03 AM - +263 77 238 5097: These days Tanatswa is not available because she has gone back to school.
15/1/24, 11:06 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for informing @263772385097. I completely understand. Since Tanatswa is going to be unavailable for further sessions, I believe parents should actively participate in these sessions, as delays in these sessions may seriously affect the timelines of Tanatswa's admission journey. So, May I please know if you are available for the sessions?
15/1/24, 11:18 AM - +263 77 238 5097: Yes i am available maybe up to 1300 hrs

15/1/24, 11:26 AM - +263 77 238 5097: I will update her sometime later because she doesn't use her phone at school.
15/1/24, 11:28 AM - Dev Edoofa: No worries, @263772385097. I understand.
15/1/24, 11:28 AM - Dev Edoofa: May I please know your understanding of each of the 4 videos that were shared with you?

15/1/24, 11:55 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to hear! Now, it is our responsibility to move NAME’S application ahead and help NAME to write a proper statement of purpose so that she can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on Tanatswa’s application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, we would require Tanatswa’s availability for approximately 30 minutes. If she is unavailable, she can provide you with her input, and you can proceed with the statement of purpose on her behalf.
15/1/24, 11:56 AM - Dev Edoofa: 1. I am sure you have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in Tanatswa's admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process. Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
15/1/24, 12:03 PM - +263 77 238 5097: As i have indicated above that Tanatswa is at school these days and it's a boarding schoo. I will have to get in touch with her today or tomorrow so that she completes her part of questions.So i will get in touch with you tomorrow.

19/1/24, 8:20 AM - +263 77 238 5097: Good morning.Let's schedule like that hoping we would have the response then.
19/1/24, 3:03 PM - +263 77 238 5097: Good afternoon Mr Kumar. Tanatswa is still sending the responses but hasn't finished yet. I will send after she finished all questions.
19/1/24, 3:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263772385097!
I hope you are doing well. Thank you for informing, I have taken note of it and will update it in our records as well. May I know when will she be able to send you the responses?
19/1/24, 3:21 PM - +263 77 238 5097: I believe up to Monday the responses Will be available.
19/1/24, 4:20 PM - +263 77 238 5097: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 4:20 PM - +263 77 238 5097: The major difference between rights and duties is rights are powers given by state to it's citizens for self development whereas duties are responsibilities and liabilities stipulated by the state to maintain law and order.Rights are not forced to be exercised whereas there is subjection to punishment if duties are not fulfilled.Rights provide freedom to any person who has them for example the right to education whereas duties limit one's freedom for example people pay tax to save public property.Both human rights and civil rights protect against discrimination, injustice and inequality.On an international level,as civil rights are determined by the laws or constitutions of an individual county,and human rights are considered universal to any human beings.Some human rights become civil rights when government chooses to put them into national laws.A simple definition that human rights are rights you have simply for being human.Comparatively,civil rights are contextual, meaning you are intitled to specific civil rights for being citizen to a particular nation.
19/1/24, 4:21 PM - +263 77 238 5097: 3.The primary difference between the responsibilities of an attorney and a prosecutor is the attorney has less experience and might not represent clients in courts.This brings out the idea that prosecutors are more familiar with the public sphere and have the ability to solve matters legally.A prosecutor is a legitimate employee of the judicial branch of government.An attorney can do some other tasks but these are carried out within the private sphere.This clearly illustrates that a prosecutor holds an upper hand in issues such as witnessing and handling concessions and other cases more than an attorney can.Comparatively, prosecutors are more qualified in legal matters and can represent their clients in court.
19/1/24, 4:21 PM - +263 77 238 5097: The branch of law I am interested in is civil law.Civil law focuses on protecting individuals' freedom from violation by governments, political and social organizations and individuals.The reason why I am interested in becoming a civil lawyer is to protect citizens from discrimination that comes from such perpetrators as political individuals and grant them freedom in the nation.The idea of humanity pushes me to pursue this branch of law.I am passionate about protecting people's freedom from violation by authorities and non governmental individuals.Although this might depend on the country one might belong to,it is of complex importance to me for everyone to attain justice in any way possible
19/1/24, 4:22 PM - +263 77 238 5097: 5.I have five key skills that I believe can make me a successful lawyer.To begin with,I am a very confident young lady and I believe this can make me a successful lawyer.Public speaking is another skill that is naturally within me.For example I am able to address large groups of people with a loud and clear voice and confidence within my gestures.A convincing speech is another skill that gives me the courage that I can be a successful lawyer.I am capable of liaising to any level possible.I  am also a trustworthy person because I do whatever task I am given with honesty.Lastly I have a skill of analysing situations, statements and even gestures and this is evident enough that I can become a successful lawyer
19/1/24, 4:24 PM - +263 77 238 5097: Good afternoon,these are Tanatswa's responses.
