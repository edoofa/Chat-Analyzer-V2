I hope all of you are doing great. While I was wrapping up my day, I observed that we were not able to have a smooth discussion for the past couple of days, which has led to some delay in the admission process. We are aware of your immense trust in us and we surely care about your future.

9/1/24, 8:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Ange'lique.

I hope all of you are having a wonderful day. Today I had a meeting with the academic board and I was discussing the current status of your application file and in the same discussion, the team higjlighted that we have been a bit off track for the discusisons we were suppsed to completed and hence I wanted to reach out to you and just reiteratre the agenda of the sessions/discusisons we have in place.
9/1/24, 8:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: The agenda for these sessions is to help you understand the process Ange'lique will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since Ange'lique is in school and you are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
9/1/24, 8:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see, our goal is to help you prepare for your child's education abroad, that is something that is going to require a significant time. It requires months of planning. Hence, to do that perfectly and be prepared, as a parent, you would have to contribute an hour daily for at least 10 days so that we can be in sync and make the right decisions.
9/1/24, 8:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: We, at Edoofa, are determined to provide affordable higher education to hardworking students and assist them in launching their careers to greater heights. We will be able to help you only if we can connect timely and have healthy discussions.
9/1/24, 8:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January]. This way, we can align it with our availability as well and help you move forward and make progress in a streamlined manner. Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your inputs and find the right time for our sessions.
9/1/24, 8:18 PM - +263 71 622 0692: Ok.noted we can adjust to 10:00am
10/1/24, 6:45 AM - +263 71 433 2297: Thank you for the concern .We will be available as from 10:00 am
10/1/24, 9:52 AM - +263 71 433 2297: Good morning
10/1/24, 1:20 PM - +263 71 433 2297: Good Afternoon

15/1/24, 2:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Ange'lique and Parents!
I hope all of you are doing great. Kindly provide me some time to realign my schedule according to your availability and then I will share my confirmation. Till the time, please be patient and allow us some time.
15/1/24, 2:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: Till then, With great excitement and pride, I want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
15/1/24, 2:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experience. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
15/1/24, 2:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we start our session today, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

How are you all doing?
16/1/24, 1:11 PM - +263 71 622 0692: We are doing good .How about you?
16/1/24, 1:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am doing good as well. Thank you for asking.

16/1/24, 1:28 PM - +263 71 622 0692: Yes we are ready
16/1/24, 1:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!
16/1/24, 1:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
16/1/24, 1:46 PM - +263 71 433 2297: Let's start
16/1/24, 1:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 1:53 PM - +263 71 433 2297: You can go ahead
16/1/24, 2:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
16/1/24, 2:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
16/1/24, 2:04 PM - +263 71 433 2297: Ok they are clear
16/1/24, 2:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
16/1/24, 2:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
16/1/24, 2:13 PM - +263 71 622 0692: Yes we are
16/1/24, 2:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
16/1/24, 2:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
16/1/24, 2:25 PM - +263 71 433 2297: Ok .Clear
16/1/24, 2:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
16/1/24, 2:34 PM - +263 71 433 2297: Let's proceed

They are periodically updated to reflect changes in the economy and business practices.The principles are designed to ensure : consistency and transparency in financial reporting and they cover a wide range of topics including revenue recognition , asset revaluation and financial statement presentation.

GAAP have many importances which are to be discussed below.

*It provides a common language for companies to communicate their financial information to investors , creditors and other stakeholders .This allows these parties to compare the financial performance of different companies in a consistent manner.

Also GAAP promotes transparency and trust in financial markets , as all parties can be confident that the information they are receiving is accurate and compete.

Finally , GAAP ensures that companies are held accountable for their financial decisions and actions which helps to improve and promote responsible financial management.
19/1/24, 3:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ange'lique!
I hope you are doing well. I see that you have answered one of the questions on the documents. May I know what is the update on the other questions? We have our session right now.

19/1/24, 3:08 PM - +263 71 622 0692: Qstn. 2) There is a strong relationship between entrepreneurship and economic development.Entrepreneurship is the ability of a person to take risk by venturing into a new business activity bringing new products or services and it is a key driver of economic development .

Economic development is the process by which a country or region improves its economic well-being, often through increases in the productivity and standard of living. This can be measured in various ways, such as increases in gross domestic product (GDP), per capita income, employment levels, or other indicators of economic health. Economic development often involves the adoption of new technologies, improvements in infrastructure, and the development of new industries.

Entrepreneurship creates new new businesses thereby creating employment for the local people.for example when Zimplats Holdings started it's operation it employed it's workers from the communities surrounding the company's mining operations in Zimbabwe and this contributed to development of Zimbabwe's economy.

Moreover entrepreneurship often initiates the manufacturing of new products which also leads to increase in exports and stimulate demand for other products further contributing to economic growth (there will be a development in the economy.

Moreover entrepreneurship promotes innovation which usually leads to new and advanced technology and processes that improve the efficiency of businesses thereby increasing economic growth (that is economy will be developed).

In a nut shell entrepreneurs enables infrastructure development since they take social responsibilities in the areas of operation ,  reduces unemployment level in the economy as well as reducin inflation since there will be an increase in the gross domestic product of the country.

19/1/24, 3:19 PM - +263 71 622 0692: Qsn.4)Accounting standards are considered to be mandatory because they are required by law  or regulation in many jurisdictions. In the United States, for example, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires all publicly traded companies to follow GAAP when preparing their financial statements.

Moreover  the IASB requires all publicly traded companies . These standards are considered mandatory because they are designed to protect investors and other users of financial statements from potential fraud or manipulation of financial information. By requiring companies to follow standardized accounting practices, these standards help to create a level playing field and promote confidence in the markets.


In addition to being mandatory, accounting standards are important because they help to ensure the comparability of financial information. For example, when two companies are preparing their financial statements, it is important that they use the same methods to account for revenue, expenses, assets, and other items. Otherwise, it would be difficult to compare their financial performance. Accounting standards also promote consistency over time, so that a company's financial statements can be compared from year to year. Finally, accounting standards help to ensure that financial statements are prepared in a clear and understandable manner, so that users can make informed decisions based on the information they contain.

International accounting standards are a set of accounting standards that have been developed by the IASB and are used by companies all over the world. The IASB's mission is to develop high-quality, globally-accepted accounting standards that bring transparency, accountability, and efficiency to financial markets. The IASB has developed several standards, including IFRS 1, which is used to set out the general principles of financial reporting; IFRS 2, which provides guidance on the recognition and measurement of share-based payments; and IFRS 9, which covers the classification and measurement of financial instruments. These standards are designed to create a single set
19/1/24, 3:19 PM - +263 71 622 0692: Qsn.5)Accounting and auditing are two distinct but related fields. Both involve the handling  of financial information, but they differ in terms of their goals and responsibilities. Accounting is the process of recording and reporting financial transactions, while auditing is the process of examining those records to ensure their accuracy. In short, accounting focuses on the production of financial statements, while auditing focuses on their evaluation. 

In addition, accountants often work as part of a company's internal team, while auditors are typically employed by an external firm.


 Another key difference between accounting and auditing is the level of independence involved. Accountants typically work for the company whose financial records they are preparing, and therefore have a vested interest in their accuracy. Auditors, on the other hand, are employed by an outside entity and have no stake in the company's financial performance. As a result, they are able to provide an unbiased and objective evaluation of the company's records.

 Furthermore, accountants generally prepare financial statements using information provided by the company, while auditors independently verify the accuracy of that information.


 Another key distinction between accounting and auditing is the level of assurance that each provides. Accountants provide reasonable assurance, meaning that they take steps to ensure the accuracy of financial statements, but they cannot guarantee absolute accuracy. Auditors, on the other hand, provide a higher level of assurance known as positive assurance. This means that they have thoroughly reviewed and tested the accuracy of financial records, and they can confidently state that the statements are free from material misstatement. In this way, auditing provides a higher level of confidence in the accuracy of financial information.

A final difference between accounting and auditing is the role of professional ethics. Both accountants and auditors are bound by professional ethics, but the nature of those ethics differs. Accountants must act in the best interests of the company they work for, while auditors must act in the best interests of the public. This difference is reflected in the ethical codes that govern each profession for example American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Code of Professional Conduct applies to accountants, while the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) Code of Ethics for  of conduct
