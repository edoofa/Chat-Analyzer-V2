8/1/24, 8:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Alois!
I hope all of you are doing great. While I was wrapping up my day, I observed that we were not able to have a smooth discussion for the past couple of days, which has led to some delay in the admission process. We are aware of your immense trust in us and we surely care about your future. Considering that in mind, I wanted to schedule a specific session tomorrow at 8:30 am so that we can cover the process we are lagging behind,  and ensure that your admission process is on track. Hence, I wanted to understand if you will be available for our session at 8:30am. If not, I would like you to please let me know at what time between 8:30 am to 4 pm will you be available?
8/1/24, 8:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the above documents I have taken a note of these and will update in our records.
9/1/24, 10:17 AM - Dev Edoofa: Shall we start with our session?
9/1/24, 11:11 AM - +263 77 306 5310: Sorry sir alois was going to school .he said we shall supposed to start session at 4 pm .
9/1/24, 11:11 AM - +263 77 306 5310: How are you sir
9/1/24, 2:10 PM - +263 77 461 7198: Noted
9/1/24, 8:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Alois.

I hope all of you are having a wonderful day. Today I had a meeting with the academic board and I was discussing the current status of your application file and in the same discussion, the team higjlighted that we have been a bit off track for the discusisons we were suppsed to completed and hence I wanted to reach out to you and just reiteratre the agenda of the sessions/discusisons we have in place.
9/1/24, 8:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: The agenda for these sessions is to help you understand the process Alois will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since Alois is in school and you are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
9/1/24, 8:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see, our goal is to help you prepare for your child's education abroad, that is something that is going to require a significant time. It requires months of planning. Hence, to do that perfectly and be prepared, as a parent, you would have to contribute an hour daily for at least 10 days so that we can be in sync and make the right decisions.
9/1/24, 8:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: We, at Edoofa, are determined to provide affordable higher education to hardworking students and assist them in launching their careers to greater heights. We will be able to help you only if we can connect timely and have healthy discussions.
9/1/24, 8:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January]. This way, we can align it with our availability as well and help you move forward and make progress in a streamlined manner. Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your inputs and find the right time for our sessions.
9/1/24, 10:13 PM - +263 77 461 7198: I think 2 pm is good for me to attend my session
11/1/24, 1:42 PM - +263 77 461 7198: How are you sir I hope you are doing great 

Please connect with my guardian as for now I'm at school so some time I can not be able to connect with you
11/1/24, 2:24 PM - +263 77 461 7198: Hello
15/1/24, 2:44 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Alois and Parents!

We will further connect in our session tomorrow! Wish you a blessed night.

The next batch of EWYL Sessions is scheduled to commence on Friday (19th January) and hence, if we are able to focus and complete the Admission Process before Friday with pure consistency, you will be able to start your EWYL journey as well in a timely manner.
16/1/24, 1:34 PM - Dev Edoofa: Kindly mark this date on your calendar and ensure that you are available to complete the necessary procedures within the stipulated timeline. If everything is proceeding as planned so far, shall we move forward and begin our session for the day?
16/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 77 306 5310: Noted sir
16/1/24, 1:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
16/1/24, 1:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *Alois 2K23DEC1526R*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
16/1/24, 1:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *Alois EWYL23E1125*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
16/1/24, 1:45 PM - +263 77 306 5310: Yes I'm understanding sir
16/1/24, 1:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: Moving forward with the procedures, I would like to share an insight with you. To ensure a seamless experience, we as a team, have prepared essential documents (printed forms) that not only value your feedback but also outline the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program and the application process. You will have to review, complete, and submit these documents as instructed. 

If you are ready, shall I share a brief overview of these documents for your ease?
16/1/24, 1:53 PM - +263 77 306 5310: Yes I'm ready sir
16/1/24, 1:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: You have already shared the printed forms, but maybe you are not aware of why these forms are important. You will get to know now.
